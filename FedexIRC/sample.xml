<name>How Address Validation API Works</name>
<description><p><b style='font-size:18px'>Validate Address</b></p><p>Use this endpoint to validate and resolve input addresses and returns real-world addresses. The address details are provided and validated in order to resolve an address. An address is stated as resolved when the input address matches the known reference data.</p><p>The required input information associated with this request is:</p><ul><li>Street Lines</li><li>City (Optional)</li><li>State or Province Code (Optional)</li><li>Postal Code (Optional)</li><li>Country Code</li></ul><p><i>Note: State code or city name is enough when customer shipping to a country which does not have a postal code.</i></p><p>The Address Validation API returns a real-world address by performing the following operations on the input address:</p><ul><li>As the first step, the API attempts to normalize the input address. This can include replacing common roadway identifiers such as street and parkway with their standard abbreviations such as ST and PKWY, as well as reordering components of the address. If an input address cannot be normalized, the resolved addresses returned will be the input address. Non-address values are discarded.</li><li>In the second step, the API attempts to standardize the normalized address by finding a possible or actual address that is likely the one intended by the user. If that standardization fails, the resolved addresses returned will be the normalized form of the input address. Refer to the elements returned to help determine the problems with the address submitted.</li><li>Certain elements of that normalized address will also be returned. If standardization does succeed, the resolved addresses returned will be that real-world address. In this case, various additional elements of the standardized address and information on how it was derived from the normalized address is also returned.</li></ul></description>

<name>Address Classification</name>
<description><p>The Address Validation API uses reference data to determine the classification of a given address. The classification for a functional address is calculated independently of the validation address process and is based on feedback by operational personnel, with commercial data sources used for confirmation only.<br /><br /> The Address Validation API has only four possible classifications for addresses: unknown, business, residential and mixed. All addresses begin with an 'unknown' classification and stay that way until address validation business rules determine that their classifications should change. A location only gets a 'mixed' classification if it is a multi-tenant-based address and contains both business and residential units.</p><p><i>Note: FedEx Express service provides an additional address line (address line 3) for recipient addresses. This additional address information provides more complete and accurate location details improving your chances of getting accurate address.</i></p><p>The real-world addresses are classified as follows:</p><b style='font-size:18px'>Business Address</b><p>A business address is an address that is used to designate your principal place of business. It is where your business is supposedly operating from, but that may not always be the case.</p><p>A business address is the official location of a company's premises. It could be anything from someone's home address right up to a multi-million-dollar campus, such as those big tech companies favor and everything in between.</p><b style='font-size:18px'>Residential Address</b><p>A residential delivery charge will apply to shipments within the U.S. made to a home or private residence, including locations where a business is operated from a home. Use FedEx Home Delivery for residential delivery via FedEx Ground in 1&minus;business days, based on distance to the destination.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>Rectory</li><li>Convent</li><li>Parsonage</li><li>Residents of multiple-unit dwellings, such as:<ul><li>Apartment buildings</li><li>Condominiums</li><li>College dormitories</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>A residence where products are sold and/or distributed</li></ul></description>

<name>Business Rules</name>
<description><ul><li>Do not assume a particular service will be available for all scenarios. For example, STANDARD_OVERNIGHT (among others) is not available between all postal codes.</li><li>If a specific service is being requested for rating, include the Service Type in the request. This will decrease the size of the reply and reduce transaction response time.</li><li>For a special service to be included on a shipment, both the special service type and its detail must be included. If the special service details are not included then there may be no indication the special services are not included.</li><li>The timestamp for a rate or shipment should be the time the package is expected to be tendered to FedEx or a FedEx agent. This is not necessarily the time at which the ship or rate transaction is performed. For example, a shipment generated late Friday night for a package that will not be picked up by FedEx until Monday should have a Monday timestamp. Use the correct timestamp if it is known, or the delivery estimation and rates may not be correct.</li><li>The rate and transit time application only uses city name or zip/postal code to define transit time. FedEx only displays the city or zip/postal code served by FedEx in the destination and origin countries you selected.</li><li>FedEx does not deliver to Post Office Box addresses in the U.S. Please enter a Zip Code to find the transit time for your shipment or click on Find Zip/Postal code.</li><li>Packages picked up from a residence may have one additional transit day. For faster returns please drop off at a staffed FedEx location.</li></ul></description>

<name>How Ship API Works</name>
<description><p>The following are the features available with this API:</p><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Create Shipment</b></p><p>Use this endpoint for creating FedEx shipment with all the necessary shipping information.</p><p>The required input information associated with this request are as follows:</p><ul><li>Account Number &ndash; The FedEx shipping account number.</li><li>Pickup Type &ndash; Indicates if shipment is being dropped off at a FedEx location or is being picked up by FedEx. Indicates if it is a regularly scheduled pickup or a new one being scheduled for this shipment. Required for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Smartpost<sup>®</sup>.</li><li>Service Type &ndash; The type of service that is used to ship the package.</li><li>Packaging Type &ndash; Packaging used for the package.</li><li>Shipper Information.</li><li>Recipient Information.</li><li>Shipping Payment Type (SENDER/RECIPIENT/THIRD_PARTY/ACCOUNT. etc.)</li><li>Payer Information &ndash; This element is optional when the payment type provided is a SENDER.</li><li>Individual Package Weights.</li><li>Label Specification &ndash; Details about the image type, printer format, and label stock for label. You can also specify customer specific details such as doc-tab content, regulatory labels, and mask data on the label.</li></ul><p>The successful response to this request will provide the tracking number and label information which will be helpful in shipment tracking.</p><p><i>Note: In order to avoid entering bad data on the label and in to the FedEx systems, do not feed non ASCII characters in to your Create Shipment request.</i></p><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Retrieve Async Ship</b></p><p>Use this endpoint to retrieve the shipments processed asynchronously using the job ID.</p><p></p>The required input information associated with this request are as follows:<p><ul><li>jobId</li><li>accountNumber</li></ul><p>The successful response to this request will return all the label and shipments report details for the respective jobId. In case the output returned has errors, resubmit the shipment by fixing the issues.</p><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Cancel Shipment</b></p><p>Use this request to cancel already created FedEx shipment/package that have already been tendered to FedEx.</p><p>The required input information associated with this request are as follows:</p><ul><li>Tracking number.</li><li>Account Number &ndash; The FedEx shipping account number.</li></ul><p>The output of this request will return an indicator and a message to conclude whether the shipment is cancelled.</p><p style='font-size:15px'>Important Notes:</p><ul><li>With the controlled parameter (deletioncontrol) value, you can specify if only one or all the packages in a shipment must be deleted.</li><li>For FedEx Express international multiple-piece shipments, if you enter the master tracking number, all packages associated with this shipment are deleted. If you attempt to delete one package in a shipment, the label sequence number will be incorrect, and you may experience clearance issues in customs if you cannot account for all packages in the shipment.</li><li>For FedEx International Ground multiple-piece shipments, if you enter any tracking number associated with the master shipment, all packages associated with the shipment are deleted.</li><li>For FedEx Ground U.S. multiple-piece shipments, you may enter a single tracking number to delete one package in the shipment. Since FedEx Ground U.S. multiple-piece shipments labels are not associated with sequential numbers (1 of 2, 2 of 2), you do not need to delete the entire shipment.</li><li>For FedEx Express C.O.D. multiple-piece shipments, enter any tracking number in the shipment to delete the entire shipment. For FedEx Ground<sup>&reg;</sup> C.O.D. multiple-piece shipments, you must delete each individual package.</li></ul><p style='font-size:15px'>Error condition and Tips:</p><p>If you are unable to delete the package or shipment, you will receive an error condition. This error condition indicates that:</p><ul><li>For FedEx Express shipments, the package has already been tendered to FedEx.</li><li>You have entered an invalid account number.</li><li>The account number, while valid, is not associated with the tracking number.</li><li>You entered an invalid tracking number. This applies to FedEx Ground shipments only. FedEx Express accepts any number with the correct number of digits.</li></ul><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Create Tag</b></p><p>FedEx creates and delivers a return shipping label to customer and collects the item for return.

<name>International shipping and packaging Options</name>
<description>In addition to standard FedEx Express packaging, you may also choose a FedEx 10kg Box or a FedEx 25kg Box. The weight limit is 22 lbs. for a FedEx 10 kg Box and 55 lbs. for a FedEx 25 kg Box. These packaging options are allowed for FedEx International Priority<sup>&reg;</sup> to more than 220 countries and territories.<ul><li>Document Shipments</li><li>Commodity Shipments</li></ul><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Document Shipping</b></p>Shipment contents that are non-dutiable are known as document shipments. However, a few countries levy $1 customs value for a document shipment.<p>For more information, see <a onclick='loadDocReference("minimumcustomsvaluecountriesorterritories")'>Minimum customs value countries</a><p><i>Note: For FedEx Express International multiple piece shipments (MPS), if one package is a document, then all packages in the shipment must be documents. This is also true for commodity shipments. All the packages must be for commodities. Commodity and Document packages cannot be in the same MPS shipment. </i></p><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Commodity Shipping</b></p>Shipment contents that are dutiable are known as commodity shipments.When shipping commodities, the entire list of all the commodities in the shipment must be included in the ship request for each package so the commodity values are calculated correctly.<p><i>Note: For FedEx Express International multiple-piece shipments, if one package is a commodity shipment, then all packages in the shipment must contain commodities. Commodity and document shipments cannot be combined in a Multiple-Piece Shipment.</p></i><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Commodity Description</u></p><p>A common reason for customs delays is an inaccurate or vague shipment description. A commodity description should answer the following questions:<ul><li>What is it?</li><li>How many are there?</li><li>What is it made from?</li><li>What is the intended use?</li></ul>Based on the commodity and the services desired, more information may be required. Commodity descriptions for dangerous goods or hazardous materials have very rigorous regulations and prohibitions. If you are shipping a commodity that falls into one of these classifications, be sure to research thoroughly the shipping restrictions for your commodity classification.</p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Identifying Restricted Commodities</u></p><p>Commodities that are imported/exported must be identified whether it is a restricted commodity in the shipping destination or from /to the destination the commodity is shipped. If a restricted commodity is shipped then the shipping is immediately stopped and the commodity is caged. The following elements are used to identify and assist you with this information: </p><ul><li>Commodity Prohibitions &ndash; This element provides information on whether the commodity is restricted or not. The commodity’s Harmonized Code is matched with its associated value to determine whether the commodity is prohibited or allowed. The response elements: <i>derivedHarmonizedCode</i>, <i>commodityIndex</i>, <i>source</i>, <i>categories</i>, and <i>type</i> indicate the type of commodity and prohibition. </li><li>Regulatory Reference Data &ndash; This element provides information on whether an additional reference data is required for the shipment. The response elements<i> waivers</i>, <i>message, code</i>, <i>text</i>, and such associated elements are displayed.</li><li>Regulatory Advisories &ndash; This element provides any additional information or clarifications regarding the commodity. The response elements advisories lists all the specified advisories. It also displays <i>code</i>,<i> text</i>, <i>parameter</i> and <i>localizedText </i>as the output.</li></ul><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Commodity Classifications</u></p>All commodities imported and/or exported must be properly classified under the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) codes to meet U.S. and foreign governments' customs requirements. Use the HTS to determine the code for your commodity. The HTS assigns six-digit codes for general categories. Countries that use the HTS are allowed to define commodities at a more detailed level than six digits, but all definitions must correspond to the six-digit HTS system. The U.S. defines commodities using 10-digit HTS codes. For links to the U.S. agencies which administer export and import HTS codes, go to the FedEx International Resource Center on fedex.com.</p></p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Commodity Export License</u></p>An export license is a specific grant of authority from the government to a particular exporter to export a specific product. Export licenses are granted on a case-by-case basis for either a single transaction or for a specified period of time. The exporter must apply for the export license. This number is one alpha plus six numeric characters. Every license is issued with an expiration date. Commodities requiring a Department of State license ship only by FedEx Express using FedEx International Controlled Export (FICE) service. <p>When the description of the contents in your international shipment are precise and well-written, the risks of customs delays decrease. Here are a few guidelines for providing detailed descriptions of your goods.</p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Document or Commodity</u></p><ul><li>Begin by determining if what you are shipping is a document or a commodity. Different countries classify documents differently, and therefore, you should understand how a specific country to which you are shipping defines them.</li><li>In general, a document is a commodity that has no commercial value. It is typically characterized by typed, written or printed matter on paper or another material, and does not require a commercial invoice. If the commodity has commercial value or is part of a commercial business transaction, it is considered a &ldquo;non-document.&rdquo; All commodity shipments require a commercial invoice.</li><li>To research the classification for your commodity, use the FedEx Global Trade Manager online at <a href='http://www.fedex.com/gtm' target='_blank'>fedex.com/gtm</a>. You will find country-specific information to determine whether your commodity is considered to be a document or non-document for your destination.</li></ul><a href='#packaging' style='float:right'>BACK TO TOP</a><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Customs Clearance</b></p>Each country has specific laws and regulations around international shipping.

For U.S. export shipping, the U.S. and destination countries require different types of regulatory documents.</p><p><u>Canada Customs and Regulatory Solutions</u></p><p>The Resolutions team provides Canadian Sales and customers with regulatory information and support for FedEx Express international shipments only.</p><p><u>Certificate of Origin (COO)</u></p><p>A COO is an international document that verifies the country where a product was manufactured. Some countries restrict imports from certain countries, many countries limit the quantity of imported goods, and some countries give preference to goods manufactured in a certain country.</p><p><u>Commercial Invoice (CI)</u></p><p>This is a document provided by the seller/exporter that describes the parties involved in the shipping transaction and the goods being transported. It is the primary document used by Customs. It should be prepared using the official language of the country to which the goods are being exported, if possible. The Commercial Invoice should include a detailed breakdown of all items included in the shipment, including: a proper description of the goods (what is it? what is it made from? what is its intended use?) the quantity, the country of manufacture, the price or cost, currency used, the Harmonized System number for each commodity and the terms of delivery. Some countries require that an original invoice be executed on the shipper's letterhead. The invoice should always be signed and dated by the exporter certifying that the details provided are true and correct representations of the contents covered by the Commercial Invoice.</p><p><u>Customs Bond for FedEx Express Imports</u></p><p>FedEx Express has appointed FedEx Trade Networks (FTN) to act as customs broker for import shipments to the U.S., unless otherwise specified. FTN serves as the importer of record (IOR) for customs purposes for the vast majority of Express import shipments; however, this role can be served by customers if preferred.</p><u>Declared Value (DV) Exception for Non-Jewelry Items</u><p>FedEx provides a permanent authorization (also known as a high declared value [HDV] exception request) for qualified customers to ship non-jewelry items valued in excess of the U.S.$50K limit specified in the FedEx Service Guide.</p><u style='font-size:16px'>Electronic Export Information (EEI)</u><p>The Electronic Export Information (EEI) formerly known as Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) is required by the US Department of Census in order to obtain statistical data and by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to assist in enforcing export controls. The SED/EEI is required when the total value of goods classified under any single Schedule B number exceeds $2,500 (USD) or the commodity(s) require an export license. This information can be completed electronically by the exporter or their agent. The information is mandatory required to be submitted electronically through the Automated Export System (AES) for commodities listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL) or the U.S. Munitions List (USML). EEI is the electronic export data filed in the Automated Export System (AES) using AESDirect in the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). The ACE Secure Data Portal (ACE Portal) is a centralized access point for the trade community to connect with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).</p><u>FedEx International Shipping Assist (FISA)</u><p>FISA is a free service targeting small and medium businesses and individuals who are new to or inexperienced with shipping internationally.</p><u>Global Trade Agreements and Trade Legislation</u><p>Businesses of all sizes benefit from global trade. U.S. Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) facilitate global trade, open foreign markets to U.S. exporters, and ensure partner countries follow common rules and standards. FTAs create a stable and transparent trading environment, making it easier for U.S. companies to export their products and services worldwide.<p><u>One-Time Declared Value (DV) Exception</u></p><p>Shippers who need a one-time increase in the standard DV limit for a U.S. domestic or U.S. export international Express shipment to a maximum of USD$250K can request a DV carriage increase, also known as a <i>domestic waiver</i> request.</p><u>Pro Forma Invoice</u><p>A Pro Forma Invoice is a document that is provided by a shipper/supplier when <ul><li>It is required prior to the shipment of merchandise to inform the perspective buyer(s) of the kind and quantities of goods to be sent, their value, and important specifications (weight, size, etc.). It may be needed by an importer in order to arrange for import permits or other clearance purposes.</li><li>A Pro Forma Invoice can also be used to provide Customs an invoice for clearance processing where acceptable in situations where the original Commercial Invoice is lost or missing.</li></ul>Customs has final discretion as to its use and acceptability, so it is always best to provide a Commercial Invoice, a Pro Forma Invoice should never be used in lieu of a Commercial Invoice unless customs indicates acceptability.</p><u>GENERAL AGENCY AGREEMENT</u><p>An Agency Agreement or Power of Attorney (POA) is the legal authority that is provided by importers to a customs broker to allow them to release and/or account for shipments with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) on behalf of the importer's company. If a Canadian Resident Importer would like Federal Express to act as their customs broker in Canada on an ongoing basis, these forms must be completed and returned as per the instruction sheet before shipping into Canada. This form is a Limited Agency Agreement and would apply to Federal Express shipments only. This form is in a fillable format for easy use in the document library section on this website.</p><u>USMCA CERTIFICATION OF ORIGIN</u><p>The USMCA/T-MEC/CUSMA Certification of Origin is a form used to claim the preferential tariff treatment for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The certification contains a set of data elements including a statement and must be certified by the exporter, producer or importer for qualifying goods. The imported goods must originate and be exported from the U.S., Mexico or Canada. This form can be used to cover a single shipment or for a 'blanket' period of up twelve months.</p><u>USMCA COMMERCIAL INVOICE - CERTIFICATION_OF ORIGIN</u><p>The USMCA/T-MEC/CUSMA Commercial Invoice-Certification of Origin is a commercial invoice combined with the required certification of origin data elements including the statement that will provide a way to both ship and claim preferential tariff treatment for qualifying goods using one document for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement. Goods that qualify for the preferential tariff treatment must originate and be exported from the U.S., Mexico or Canada.</p><u>DANGEROUS GOODS SHIPPERS DECLARATION</u><p>This is shippers declaration for danagerous goods, containing nature and quantity of the goods with signed declaration.</p><u>OP_900</u><p>This is FedEx Ground Hazardous material declaration form.</p><u>Shipper's Letter of Instruction (SLI)</u><p>An SLI captures international shipment information for U.S. customers. </p><i>Note:</p><ul><li>Customs clearance is included for shipments to Canada through our brokerage-inclusive service, a fee applies.

You may add text pertaining to your business and choose the type of barcode (symbology) used on FedEx documents and labels in the custom portion of thermal labels.</p><p>To support your shipping application, FedEx Ship API provide two options for customizing your shipping label:</p><ul><li>Place the PNG PAPER 7' x475' graphic on your label stock. For example, you may create a packing list on an 8-1/2' x 11' form. As part of this form, you may also place the 7'x 475' PNG PAPER graphic instead of creating a custom label on your own.</li><li>Add a graphic or text file to the 4' x 8' or 4' x 9' thermal label. This label size provides 2 inches of space for your graphic or text.</li></ul><p><i>Note: The label's human readable content and barcode in the common portion of the label cannot be altered.</i></p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Custom Validator Label</u></p><p>You can create non-shipping custom labels at both package-level and shipment-level by specifying what custom information is desired, how to format that information, and where to place it on the custom label. Custom labels are limited to the thermal label format.</p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Customize a Thermal Label</u></p><p>FedEx API provides two thermal label formats that you can customize with either a graphic or text file to prevent the need for creating a custom label. These labels support all FedEx shipping services. These formats are:</p><ul><li>4' x 8' thermal label without Doc-Tab</li><li>4' x 9' thermal label with Doc-Tab</li></ul><p>These label types provide a two-inch customizable section. This feature is only applicable to the thermal label printed on a thermal printer set to 203 DPI.</p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Rules for Custom Label</u></p><p>Rules for using the label formats are:</p><ul><li>Only the shipping label can be customized. For example, if you print a 4' x 8' Express shipping label with your logo, the secondary recipient labels will not display it.</li><li>The customizable graphic or text must not exceed 2 inches high and 4-1/2 inches wide.</li><li>No correction is provided by FedEx. The graphic and/or text prints as it is submitted in the shipping service.</li><li>If all the necessary data for printing the graphic and/or text is not provided (for example: X and Y coordinates), a valid shipping label is returned without the customized data. You must cancel the shipment represented by this label if you attempt to recreate another label with the graphic and/or text.</li><li>Regarding the placement on X and Y coordinates, insertion point coordinate datum is the intersection of the top and left edges of the 4.00&rdquo; x 6.75&rdquo; thermal label with bottom doc tab. For 4.00&rdquo; x 6.75&rdquo; thermal label with top doc tab, increment insertion point coordinate Y values by 164 dots. For 4.00&rdquo; x 6.00&rdquo; label without doc tab, increment insertion point coordinate Y values by 8 dots. Thermal label element attributes are based on 203 DPI (8 dots/mm) printer resolution.</li><li>Character insertion point is the top left corner of the first character in the string, at the cap line.</li><li>Printer restrictions require the position origin at the top left quadrant of the front. Therefore, it is possible for data to start in the customizable section of the label and write down into the FedEx portion of the label (actual thermal label data). If this occurs, your logo or text will be written over with the FedEx label information. You must correct this positioning to use the shipping label.</li><li>The addition of Doc-Tab information to the 4' x 9' label must be configured using the same process as you would use for a standard 4' x 6' Doc-Tab thermal label.</li></ul><p><i>Note: Only single bit color images should be added since labels will print in black and white</i><i>.</i></p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Custom Label Graphic Entries Elements</u></p><p>API provides PNG (Portable Network Graphic) images for FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground labels. The PNG label graphic is a replica of the thermal or plain paper labels supported by API. This label option allows you to place the PNG label graphic on your label stock to prevent the need for creating a custom label.</p><p>The following requirements apply when using the 4' x 6' PNG graphic embedded in your shipping document:</p><ul><li>Label Stock</li><li>Printer</li><li>Scaling</li></ul><p><u>Label Stock</u></p><p>4' x 6' PNG labels should only be used with peel-and-stick label stock. The FedEx Ground and FedEx Express label certification teams will reject 4' x 6' PNG labels that are not on peel-and-stick label stock, including any labels printed on plain paper.</p><p><u>Printer</u></p><p>Laser printers are recommended for printing labels. Ink jet printers should not be used because of their inconsistency in creating scannable barcodes. The 4' x 6' PNG label cannot be printed using a color printer unless the color definition is set to black, even if the printer only has a black cartridge installed. This setting is necessary to achieve the correct barcode definition for scanning at the FedEx hubs.</p><p><u>Scaling</u></p><p>The image returned in your shipping transaction is 200 dots per inch (DPI) and measures 4' (W) x 6' (H) or 800 x 1200 pixels. This label has a vertical orientation and is designed to print in a 4' x 6' label area. When printed, the label should measure 4' x 6'.</p><p>To produce the label and barcodes in the required DPI, you must scale (or resize) the image before printing. How you scale the image depends on the application you are using to view and print the label. To scale the PNG image for a 4' x 6' label in inches: use 4' width and 6' length exactly.</p><p><b> </b></p><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Label Review Checklist</b></p><p><u>All Barcodes</u></p><p>Required for validation:</p><ul><li>Quiet Zone: Must always have at least 0.1' white space both above and below barcode.</li><li>Quiet Zone: Must always have at least 0.2' white space both left and right of barcode.</li><li>Validate that all barcodes meet minimum height requirements.</li></ul><p><u>Print Quality</u></p><p>Common problems that cause labels to be rejected:</p><ul><li>Split Bars</li><li>Faded Print/White Voids</li><li>Repeating White Voids (roller problem)</li><li>Smudging (thermal transfer)</li><li>Flaking (laser) indicates Toner Fusion Problem</li><li>Wrinkled in the Print (thermal transfer)</li><li>Print Contrast for direct thermal labels must be at least 90%</li></ul><p><u>Human Readable details for Ground Labels</u></p><p>For the Human Readable for FedEx Ground Labels, the following are required for validation:</p><ul><li>Data matches barcode</li><li>FedEx Ground logo: Logos are available for download from the FedEx Identity website fedex.com.</li><li>FedEx Home Delivery logo: labels must have a large &ldquo;H&rdquo; in a box within 1' of the ship to address.

<description><p>A multiple-piece shipment (MPS) consists of two or more packages shipped to the same recipient addresses.

[Note: The <i>sequenceNumber</i> for master package must be equal to 1.]</li><li>For printing label per package, include Master tracking details in element <i>masterTrackingId</i> for all subsequent packages.</li></ul><p>Following are the Multiple-Piece Shipping Processing options available with this API:</p><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Print Package Label One At A Time</b></p><p>This processing option allows you to process the MPS shipments and get labels one at a time. This is an optimal method, in case the packages to be processed sequentially and labels to be generated per package.</p><p>When you need this capability for your shipments, In the shipment request provide element <i>oneLabelAtATime as true</i> as true along with all necessary MPS elements.</p><p>The output of the first request should generate label and tracking number which is master tracking number. Provide this master tracking number in the element <i>masterTrackingId</i> to process subsequent ship request and generate labels with tracking numbers (child tracking numbers) for the defined total package count (<i>groupPackageCount</i>).</p><p><i>Note: <ul><li>The maximum packages allowed in this processing option are 200.</li><li>The final shipment documents/reports will be generated if sequenceNumber is equal to groupPackageCount</li></ul></i></p><b><p style='font-size:16px'><b>Print All Package Labels At Once</b></p></b><p>This processing option allows you to process the MPS shipments and get labels in single shot.

With this processing option, FedEx internally ensures that these bulk shipments are processed, and you can get the label data periodically.</p><p>When the transaction is asynchronously processed, the reply to this request only confirms that the request is queued successfully but the shipment itself might not be successfully processed and also returns <i>jobId</i> to retrieve the result later.</p><p><i>Note: This process requires some time for the shipment to be processed successfully before you retrieve the result.</i></p><p>For retrieving the asynchronous shipment result, use endpoint <b>Retrieve Async Ship</b> and provide <i>jobId </i> and <i>accountNumber</i> details in the request.

In the response, a <i>jobId</i> will be returned. You should then use endpoint <b><i>Retrieve Async Ship</i></b> to retrieve the shipment result to get the label data.</p><p>The following high-level workflow demonstrates asynchronous shipping processings:<ul><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Create Shipment</b></i> to create shipment with more than 40 packages.</li><li>Specify all necessary shipment details along with element <i>processingOptionType</i> as <i>ALLOW_ASYNCHRONOUS</i> and Specify element <i>labelResponseOptions</i> as <i>LABEL</i>.</li><li>The successful submission will provide <i>jobId</i>.</li><li>Use the <i>jobId</i> and <i>accountNumber</i> to retrieve the output results using <b><i>Retrieve Async Ship</i></b> endpoint.</li><li>The successful output will provide the resultant data and label details.</li><li>If the result has errors, the error details will be provided in the response.</li><li>After correcting the errors, recreate and submit the shipment for successful response.</li></ul></p><p><i>Note:<ul><li>If there are errors in the asynchronous shipment response, you cannot reconfirm or fix it in the same shipment request.

<name>Return Shipping</name>
<description>Returns are available for domestic and international shipping in a variety of areas wherever existing FedEx Express services are available. You can associate or "link" an outbound shipment with a return shipment using the tracking numbers. When processing your global return package with FedEx automation, you will need to provide a reason for that return for customs clearance purposes, on both the outbound and return shipments, when processing your package. Identify your package as a return and include the return type. Select the correct return reason from the table below.<table style='width: 100%;'><tbody><tr><th>OUTBOUND<p>What's the reason for including a return label?</p></th><th>RETURN<p>What's the reason for the return?</p></th><th>When to use</th></tr><tr><td>Courtesy Return Label</td><td>Rejected Merchandise</td><td>Select these two reasons when you're including a return label for your customer in your shipment, but typically don't expect returns.</td></tr><tr><td>For Exhibition/Trade Show</td><td>Exhibition/Trade Show Returns</td><td>Select these two reasons when the goods you're shipping are for a show, exhibition, trade show or event.</td></tr><tr><td>Item for Loan</td><td>Return of Loaned Item</td><td>Select these two reasons when the goods you're shipping are for temporary use by the recipient to be returned to you in an unaltered state.</td></tr><tr><td>For Repair/Processing</td><td>Repair/Processing Returns</td><td>Select these two reasons when the goods you're shipping will be either repaired or otherwise processed before being returned to you.

Use the Create Shipment endpoint to print a return label and include it in the original shipment to your customer or send it separately. To use the print return label, your customer simply prepares their package for shipping and applies the return label. Then they may tender the FedEx Express<sup>&reg;</sup> U.S. or international package, or FedEx International Ground<sup>&reg;</sup> package to FedEx by scheduling a pickup, using a regular scheduled pickup, or visiting a FedEx drop-off location. </p><p>In addition, a Returns Material Authorization (RMA) reference number can be included in your ship transaction. The RMA number prints on the labels as barcode and in human readable form on your FedEx invoice and can be used to track the return package. FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground return labels are interchangeable, regardless of the original shipping service. For example, you can send the original shipment using a FedEx Express service but include a FedEx Ground return label as part of your packing documents.</p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>FedEx Print Return Label Service Details</u></p><p>The following service details apply to FedEx Express and FedEx Ground return labels:</p><ul><li>In the U.S., printed return labels are available for FedEx First Overnight<sup>&reg;</sup>, FedEx Priority Overnight<sup>&reg;</sup>, FedEx Standard Overnight<sup>&reg;</sup>, FedEx 2Day<sup>&reg;</sup>, FedEx 2Day<sup>&reg;</sup>A.M., FedEx Ground<sup>&reg;</sup>, FedEx Home Delivery<sup>&reg;</sup> throughout 50 states in U.S.</li><li>For international destinations, printed return labels are available for FedEx International First<sup>&reg;</sup>, FedEx International Priority<sup>&reg;</sup> and FedEx International Ground<sup>&reg;</sup>.</li><li>Additional service options include Saturday Service, Dry Ice Shipments, and Hold at Location.</li><li>Dangerous Goods and Hazardous Materials cannot be shipped.</li><li>The maximum declared value is<ul><li>$1,000USD for FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard Overnight, and FedEx 2Day.</li><li>$100USD for FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery.</li></ul></li></ul><p>For more detailed information about the services offered by FedEx, see the electronic <a href='https://www.fedex.com/en-us/service-guide.html' target='_blank'>FedEx Service Guide</a>.</p><p style='font-size:15px'><u>Alternate Return Address</u></p><p>The Ship API offers an alternate return address option that allows you to override your shipper address and print a different address on the shipping label.

<description><p>The following are the key features associated with the FedEx<sup>&reg;</sup> Pickup Request API:<p><b style='font-size:18px'>Pickup Availability</b></p>With pickup availability, you can check the availability of the pickup service based on the input request. The pickup availability depends on two factors: the cutoff time and the access time.<p>Cutoff time - The latest allowed time for a pickup to be scheduled. The time is local to the pickup postal code.</p>Access time - The time between the pickup ready time (when the package is ready to be picked up) and the time when the driver is ready to pick up the package.</p><p><p><b style='font-size:18px'>Create Pickup</b></p><b></b>This option allows you to schedule a pickup and applies to FedEx Express<sup>&reg; </sup>and FedEx Ground<sup>&reg;</sup> domestic and international shipments. The FedEx Ground and Express pickup request API returns a pickup confirmation number and additionally location code is returned with Express pickup request for the scheduled pickup. You can also schedule pickup for a return shipment using this API.</p><p>Additional recipient address line (Address line 3) allows you to provide more complete and accurate location details to achieve faster delivery of FedEx Express<sup>&reg;</sup> shipments.

<name>Introduction</name>
<description><p>This API enables you to create an Open Shipment and allows to add packages to the shipment over a period of time rather than entering all the shipment and package information all at once. The shipment remains open for a five-day period and allows package additions and modifications during that time. Once the shipment is confirmed, the shipping paperwork such as labels, AWB or reports can be generated. At the end of the fifth day, the shipment must be confirmed, or it will be purged.</p><i>Note: The Open Shipments will be purged if they are not confirmed within the end of fifth day from the shipment creation.</i></description>

<record>
<name>Open Ship API Details</name>
<description><p>Open Ship API is used when you want to add multiple packages to a shipment over a period of time and you are unsure on how many packages you plan to add or when the shipment will be completed. This gives you a flexible way to prepare your shipment throughout the day until you are ready to ship.</p><p>Open Ship shipments are often multiple-piece shipments but can also be single package shipments, referred to as single-piece shipments.</p><p>To ship a multiple-piece shipment (MPS) to a single consignee, use Open Ship API and add individual packages to the shipment or add multiple packages if they are going to the same recipient.</p><p>Following are the services associated with Open Shipment:<ul><li>FedEx Express<sup>&reg;</sup> intra-U.S. and intra-Canada</li><li>FedEx Ground<sup>&reg;</sup> intra-U.S. and intra-Canada</li><li>FedEx Home Delivery<sup>&reg;</sup></li><li>FedEx International Priority<sup>&reg;</sup></li><li>FedEx International Priority<sup>&reg;</sup> Express (IPE)</li><li>FedEx International Economy<sup>&reg;</sup></li><li>FedEx Priority Overnight<sup>TM</sup></li></ul></p><p>Following are the features associated with Open Ship API:</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Manage Open Shipments</b></p><p>This feature allows the shippers to create, modify, delete Open Shipments, and can retrieve the already created Open Shipment for review or verification purposes. It allows to confirm the completed shipment to transfer shipment data to FedEx and to generate appropriate shipment paperwork. It also identifies and reports the errors if any in the transaction and provides appropriate status.</p><p>The key information in this feature are <i>accountNumber, Shipment Data, groupPackageCount, index</i> to denote the master package in the shipment. The result of this feature will ensure shipment data is uploaded to the FedEx systems and appropriate tracking numbers, labels and shipment reports are generated.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Manage Open Shipment Packages</b></p><p>This feature allows you to add, modify and delete packages in the already created Open Shipment. One can also retrieve the existing package for an existing Open Shipment.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Get Open Shipment Results (Asynchronous)</b></p><p>This feature allows to retrieve confirmed shipment results asynchronously. When an Open Shipment with 40 or more packages is confirmed, the API processes the shipment asynchronously.</p><p>When the shipment is asynchronously processed, the reply to this request only confirms that the request is queued successfully though the shipment might or might not be successfully processed. As a response, it returns <i>jobId</i> to retrieve the result later. This feature uses <i>jobId</i> to retrieve the shipment results which could be labels, shipment reports. It also identifies and reports the errors if any in the shipment and provides appropriate status.</p><i>Note: If there are errors in the asynchronous shipment response, fix the errors and submit a new shipment request.</i></description>

The key inputs are <i>index</i> and <i>accountNumber</i> of the Open Shipment for which the packages are added.</li><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Confirm Open Shipment</i></b> to finally confirm that all the packages are added, and the shipment is complete. The key inputs are <i>index</i>, and <i>accountNumber </i>of the shipment to be confirmed.</li></ol><p>This <b><i>Confirm Open Shipment</i></b> endpoint is the final endpoint in this flow which validates the shipment and package information and successfully generates labels and all other reports for the shipment. It also provides the error details returned during validation. These errors can be fixed using the endpoints <b><i>Modify Open Shipment</i></b> or <b><i>Modify Open Shipment Packages</i></b> and confirming the shipment again for successful request.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Workflow for more than 40 packages</b></p><ol><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Create Open Shipment</i></b> to create an Open Shipment with all the required shipping, packaging information, <i>accountNumber</i> and <i>index</i>.</li><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Add Open Shipment Packages</i></b> to add one or more (not more than 40) packages to the already created Open Shipment.

The key inputs are <i>index</i>, and <i>accountNumber </i>of the shipment to be confirmed. In this case since the packages are more than 40, the API processes the shipment asynchronously and returns <i>jobId, </i>to be used later to retrieve the shipment results<i>. </i>If response has errors, then these errors should be fixed using the endpoints <b><i>Modify Open Shipment</i></b> or <b><i>Modify Open Shipment Packages</i></b> and confirm the shipment using endpoint <b><i>Confirm Open Shipment</i></b>.</li><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Get Open Shipment Results</i></b> to retrieve the confirmed Open Shipment results such as labels and shipping paperwork. The key inputs are <i>jobId</i> and <i>accountNumber</i> for confirmed shipment.</li></ol><p>The <b><i>Get Open Shipment Results</i></b> endpoint is the final endpoint in this flow which retrieves the confirmed Open Shipment results such as labels and all other reports for the confirmed Open Shipment. If error details are returned in the response, then these errors can be fixed using the endpoints <b><i>Modify Open Shipment</i></b> or <b><i>Modify Open Shipment Packages</i></b>, then confirm the shipment using endpoint <b><i>Confirm Open Shipment</i></b> and finally use endpoint <b><i>Get Open Shipment Results</i></b> to retrieve the confirmed Open Shipment results for the successful request.</p></description>

<name>Multiple-Piece Open Shipping (MPS)</name>
<description><p>A multiple-piece Open Shipment (MPS) consists of two or more packages shipped to the same recipient addresses. The first package in the shipment request is considered the master package.</p><p>To create a multiple-piece shipment:</p><ul><li>Include the shipment level information such as <i>serviceType, packagingType, totalWeight, totalPackageCount, </i>and <i>requestedPackageLineItems</i>details for the master package. <br><i>Note: The sequenceNumber for master package must be equal to 1</i>.</li><li>Add all the packages to the shipment.</li><li>Confirm the shipment.</li></ul><p>After the shipment confirmation, one of the below processing options is used:</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Synchronous Shipment Processing</b></p><p>Synchronous processing is one of the optimal processing methods, which is used internally when a shipment has either 40 or less packages (total package count/grouppackagecount&lt;=40) with limited commodities in the shipment.</p><p>Shipment request with 40 or less packages when confirmed will be processed synchronously and the labels, shipment documents/reports will be generated instantaneously. This process is optimal for shippers, if there is a time constraint and if the labels must be printed immediately upon shipment confirmation.</p><p><i>Note: The maximum 40 package limit is indicative and is not a fixed limit. The limit is also dependent on the combination of packages and commodities in the shipment. For more information, contact your FedEx support team.</i></p><p>Example: Your Open Shipment request consists of 10 packages. When you confirm the shipment after adding all 10 packages, the shipment will be processed synchronously. In the response, 10 labels will be created, and either label URLs or encoded labels as requested is provided in the response.</p><p>The following high-level workflow demonstrates synchronous Open Shipment processing:</p><ol><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Create Open Shipment</i></b>.</li><li>Add 1- 40 packages using endpoint <b><i>Add Open Shipment Packages</i></b></li><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Confirm Open Shipment</i></b> to confirm the Open Shipment.</li><li>Successful request should generate labels and the output response will have either label URLs or encoded labels as requested.</li><li>If the shipment has errors, the error details will be provided in the response.</li><li>After correcting all the errors, use endpoint <b><i>Confirm Open Shipment</i></b> for successful response.</li></ol><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Asynchronous Shipment Processing</b></p><p>The API internally processes shipment asynchronously, when the total number of packages exceeds 40 (i.e., totalPackageCount&gt;40). This is a very convenient method, when your package volume is large, and you want to submit the bulk shipments periodically. This bulk shipment submission uses various expensive FedEx resources &amp; operations, when submitted at once. With this processing option, FedEx internally ensures that these bulk shipments are processed easily, and you can also get the label data periodically.</p><p>When the shipment is asynchronously processed, the reply to this request only confirms that the request is queued successfully though the shipment might or might not be successfully processed and returns <i>jobId </i>to retrieve the result later.</p><p><i>Note: This process requires some time for the shipment to be processed successfully before you retrieve the result</i>.</p><p>For retrieving the asynchronous shipment results, use endpoint <b><i>Get Open Shipment Results</i></b> and provide <i>jobId</i> and <i>accountNumber</i> details in the request. The response to this request will either return shipment result data with label details or the shipment error details.</p><p>Example: Your shipment consisting of 45 packages, when confirmed will be processed asynchronously. In the response, a<i> jobId</i> will be returned. You should then use endpoint <b><i>Get Open Shipment Results</i></b> to retrieve the shipment results and label data.</p><p>The following high-level workflow demonstrates asynchronous shipping processing:</p><ol><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Create Open Shipment</i></b>.</li><li>Add 40 or more packages using endpoint <b><i>Add Open Shipment Packages.</i></b></li><li>Use endpoint <b><i>Confirm Open Shipment</i></b> to confIrm the shipment.</li><li>The successful submission will provide <i>jobId</i>.</li><li>Use the <i>jobId </i>and<i> accountNumber</i> to retrieve the output results using <b><i>Get Open Shipment Results</i></b> endpoint.</li><li>The successful output will provide the shipment result data with label details.</li><li>If the result has errors, the error details will be provided in the response.</li></ol><p><i>Note:<ul><li>If there are errors in the response, fix the errors using endpoint <b>Modify Open Shipment Packages</b>, then confirm the shipment using <b>Confirm Open Shipment</b> and get the successful output results using <b>Get Open Shipment Results </b>endpoint.</i></li><li>The maximum allowed packages for asynchronous shipment are 300.</li></ul></i></p></description>

You may add text pertaining to your business and choose the type of barcode (symbology) used on FedEx documents and labels in the custom portion of thermal labels.</p><p>To support your shipping application, FedEx Open Ship API provide two options for customizing your shipping label:</p><ul><li>Place the PNG PAPER 7' x4.75' graphic on your label stock. For example, you may create a packing list on an 8-1/2' x 11' form. As part of this form, you may also place the 7' x 4.75' PNG PAPER graphic instead of creating a custom label on your own.</li><li>Add a graphic or text file to the 4' x 8' or 4' x 9' thermal label. This label size provides 2 inches of space for your graphic or text.</li></ul><p><i>Note: The label's human readable content and barcode in the common portion of the label cannot be altered.</i></p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Custom Validator Label</b></p><p>You can create non-shipping custom labels at both package-level and shipment-level by specifying what custom information is desired, how to format that information, and where to place it on the custom label. Custom labels are limited to the thermal label format.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Customize a Thermal Label</b></p><p>FedEx API provides two thermal label formats that you can customize with either a graphic or text file to prevent the need for creating a custom label. These labels support all FedEx shipping services. These formats are:</p><ul><li>4' x 8' thermal label without Doc-Tab</li><li>4' x 9' thermal label with Doc-Tab</li></ul><p>These label types provide a two-inch customizable section. This feature is only applicable to the thermal label printed on a thermal printer set to 203 DPI.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Rules for Custom Label</b></p><p>Rules for using the label formats are:</p><ul><li>Only the shipping label can be customized. For example, if you print a 4' x 8' Express shipping label with your logo, the secondary recipient labels will not display it.</li><li>The customizable graphic or text must not exceed 2 inches high and 4-1/2 inches wide.</li><li>No correction is provided by FedEx. The graphic and/or text prints as it is submitted in the shipping service.</li><li>If all the necessary data for printing the graphic and/or text is not provided (for example: X and Y coordinates), a valid shipping label is returned without the customized data. You must cancel the shipment represented by this label if you attempt to recreate another label with the graphic and/or text.</li><li>Regarding the placement on X and Y coordinates, insertion point coordinate datum is the intersection of the top and left edges of the 4.00&rdquo; x 6.75&rdquo; thermal label with bottom doc tab. For 4.00&rdquo; x 6.75&rdquo; thermal label with top doc tab, increment insertion point coordinate Y values by 164 dots. For 4.00&rdquo; x 6.00&rdquo; label without doc tab, increment insertion point coordinate Y values by 8 dots. Thermal label element attributes are based on 203 DPI (8 dots/mm) printer resolution.</li><li>Character insertion point is the top left corner of the first character in the string, at the cap line.</li><li>Printer restrictions require the position origin at the top left quadrant of the front. Therefore, it is possible for data to start in the customizable section of the label and write down into the FedEx portion of the label (actual thermal label data). If this occurs, your logo or text will be written over with the FedEx label information. You must correct this positioning to use the shipping label.</li><li>The addition of Doc-Tab information to the 4' x 9' label must be configured using the same process as you would use for a standard 4' x 6' Doc-Tab thermal label.</li></ul><p><i>Note: Only single bit color images should be added since labels will print in black and white</i><i>.</i></p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Custom Label Graphic Entries Elements</b></p><p>API provides PNG (Portable Network Graphic) images for FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground labels. The PNG label graphic is a replica of the thermal or plain paper labels supported by API. This label option allows you to place the PNG label graphic on your label stock to prevent the need for creating a custom label.</p><p>The following requirements apply when using the 4' x 6' PNG graphic embedded in your shipping document:</p><ul><li>Label Stock</li><li>Printer</li><li>Scaling</li></ul><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Label Stock</b></p><p>4' x 6' PNG labels should only be used with peel-and-stick label stock. The FedEx Ground and FedEx Express label certification teams will reject 4' x 6' PNG labels that are not on peel-and-stick label stock, including any labels printed on plain paper.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Printer</b></p><p>Laser printers are recommended for printing labels. Ink jet printers should not be used because of their inconsistency in creating scannable barcodes. The 4' x 6' PNG label cannot be printed using a color printer unless the color definition is set to black, even if the printer only has a black cartridge installed. This setting is necessary to achieve the correct barcode definition for scanning at the FedEx hubs.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'>Scaling</b></p><p>The image returned in your shipping transaction is 200 dots per inch (DPI) and measures 4' (W) x 6' (H) or 800 x 1200 pixels. This label has a vertical orientation and is designed to print in a 4' x 6' label area. When printed, the label should measure 4' x 6'.</p><p>To produce the label and barcodes in the required DPI, you must scale (or resize) the image before printing. How you scale the image depends on the application you are using to view and print the label. To scale the PNG image for a 4' x 6' label in inches: use 4' width and 6' length exactly.</p><p><b style='font-size:16px'> Label Review Checklist </b></p><p><u style='font-size:15px'>All Barcodes</u></p><p>Required for validation:</p><ul><li>Quiet Zone: Must always have at least 0.1' white space both above and below barcode.</li><li>Quiet Zone: Must always have at least 0.2' white space both left and right of barcode.</li><li>Validate that all barcodes meet minimum height requirements.</li></ul><p><u style='font-size:15px'>Print Quality</u></p><p>Common problems that cause labels to be rejected:</p><ul><li>Split Bars</li><li>Faded Print/White Voids</li><li>Repeating White Voids (roller problem)</li><li>Smudging (thermal transfer)</li><li>Flaking (laser) indicates Toner Fusion Problem</li><li>Wrinkled in the Print (thermal transfer)</li><li>Print Contrast for direct thermal labels must be at least 90%</li></ul><p><u style='font-size:15px'>Human Readable details for Ground Labels</u></p><p>For the Human Readable for FedEx Ground Labels, the following are required for validation:</p><ul><li>Data matches barcode</li><li>FedEx Ground logo: Logos are available for download from the FedEx Identity website fedex.com.</li><li>FedEx Home Delivery logo: labels must have a large &ldquo;H&rdquo; in a box within 1' of the ship to address.

<description><p>Trade Documents Upload API is an international FedEx shipping document upload solution that simplifies your global shipping needs and allows you to electronically upload customs documentation required for international shipments. You can submit most of your trade documents electronically relieving yourself from printing or attaching trade documents with the shipment.</p><p>The customs and other agencies receive electronically sent documents faster than paper copies attached with your shipment. The customs clearance process is also optimized as capturing and sharing of critical trade information is done at earlier stages of shipping.</p><p><i>Note: In certain scenarios, the originals of specific international documents still need to be attached to the package.

<description><p><b style='font-size:18px'>FedEx DG Ready</b></p><p>Dangerous goods declarations and hazardous materials shipments must meet many regulatory requirements beyond the declaration or shipping paper. A FedEx DG Ready software solution are built to effectively make sure all requirements, or paperwork performed for the Dangerous Goods upload are valid.</p><p>A FedEx DG Ready software solution can also provide guidance for packaging, marking and labeling shipments &mdash; and offers other convenient features. When you are choosing a FedEx DG Ready solution, check to see what additional guidance and features are available. For more information on FedEx DG Ready information and solutions, visit <a href='https://www.fedex.com/en-us/shipping/dg-ready.html' target='_blank'>FedEx DG Ready</a>.</p><p><b style='font-size:18px'>Identifying Dangerous Goods</b></p><p>You must identify whether a shipping commodity is a dangerous goods or not and this requires proper identification, classification, packaging, markings, labeling, and documentation.</p><p>You must identify the category of the commodity to classify whether your shipment contains dangerous goods. This category includes aerosol sprays, airbags, ammunition, butane, car batteries, cologne, dry ice, fireworks, gasoline, jet fuel, lighters, lithium batteries, matches, nail polish, nail polish remover, nitrogen-refrigerated liquid, paint, perfume, solvents, some chemicals, and more.</p><p>If you are unsure whether your commodity meets the criteria for dangerous goods or which dangerous goods identification and classification applies to your shipment, contact the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p><p><b style='font-size:18px'>Ground vs. Air Regulations</b></p><p>Some items may not be regulated as dangerous goods if they travel by ground but are regulated by IATA if they are offered for transportation via FedEx Express<sup>&reg;</sup> services.

<name>Introduction</name>
<description><p>The Freight LTL Classic API allows you to create shipments for less&ndash;than&ndash;truckload (LTL). LTL Freight is too large to be shipped as a parcel but takes up less than an entire truck.</p><p>This allows you to get rate estimates, creates as many shipping labels for individual handling units and print a Bill of Lading (BOL) for an entire Freight shipment. A single tracking number is generated and printed on all these shipping labels. BOL will be generated and it must be printed to attach with the shipment.</p><p>You can also check availability of and schedule pickups, get rate quotes and track statuses of your shipment. This results in increased efficiency for your larger, and heavier shipments.</p></description>
