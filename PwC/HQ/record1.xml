Advisory June 25, 2019 As discussed over the last few Fridays, functionality allowing you more flexibility in structuring agreements with independent talent is LIVE in Talent Exchange. You can now offer Daily, Weekly rates, and Incentive fees on time-based roles, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Review the prior PwC Inside articles to learn more about all of the new features, have your burning questions answered in the FAQs, or log in now to see for yourself. As promised, we also have some winners to announce. But first, some of our favorites from the use cases submitted: Fixed Price In video production, we usually hire a "one-man-band" who does it all. They should be paid by deliverable, not hour, which is even more important when the review process gets delayed. Fixed rate requires pristine clarity and proven work experience/trust, so it’s beneficial that scope, deliverables, detailed tasks, are locked down and understood, upfront. Daily/Weekly Rates Allow manageable rounds of revisions and communications with minimal risk of budget overruns. Some resources may take longer to complete tasks in order to increase billable hours, so daily/weekly rates provide TE resources more rate consistency, allow them additional work/life balance and help PwC teams better manage budget. Incentive Fees Sometimes after working with an individual contractor, we find that he or she is an even better fit than first expected. We can reward them with additional project scope (which they may not want) but the fee could incentivize them to take it on. We received a lot of great use cases on how to use the new features, but a few had to win out...

We’ve got automation ideas, yes we do...how about you? Advisory June 14, 2019 Earlier this spring, Advisory leadership approached six account teams with a simple challenge in the spirit of our Your Tomorrow strategy: to share their brightest ideas to innovate delivery across some of our largest and most complex engagements. In just three weeks, more than 340 authors submitted over 60 original ideas (talk about a lot of “light bulb” moments!). Submissions were evaluated by members of the Digital Lab team on the basis of hours saved, improved delivery quality, and potential uses in other areas of the firm and Advisory. At the end of May, three lucky teams were given the opportunity to pitch their ideas live in front of US &amp; Global Advisory Leader Mohamed Kande and Advisory Managing Partner Ted Young. Here’s what their view of the future looks like: Automated Controls Monitoring Solution - Microsoft account team (Point of Contact: Matt Hobbs) The Microsoft account team saw an opportunity to automate the monitoring of certain internal controls that are performed frequently and often manually across an organization. This center of controls automation would be leveraged to reduce errors, learn the patterns by function, provide insights, and move away from offshore delivery performing costly low value added activities. CECL Insights Big Data Visualization Engine - Citi account team (Point of Contact: Jai Sinha) The Citi account team thought there had to be a better way to harness all of the data used to support decision making for our financial services clients. This solution leverages a data visualization tool to mass produce standardized charts and tables based on data passed automatically from another software application. The payoff? Efficiently producing the approximately 30 table and 40 charts that constitute a single deliverable document, each with varying fonts, axes, and formats. Agile Hygiene Resolver - Southwest account team (Point of Contact: Chuck Christensen) The Southwest Airlines account team was tired of inefficiencies related to management of their Agile sprints. Their proposed automation would leverage data from their Agile program management tool, Jira, to cut down the time required to analyze the health of each team’s Agile sprints. The solution would employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to evaluate things like how long a user story has been in each swimlane of a kanban board, if there is missing metadata, how long each size of story should be in each swimlane, and if large stories are at risk of delivery, to improve decision making and automate routine task maintenance. While these solutions are in varying stages of development, one thing is clear - these ideas have applications well beyond the scope of these specific accounts. If you are interested in learning more about the status of one of these ideas, reach out to the account team contacts noted above. And if you’re interested in seeing an example of another idea already brought to life in the Digital Lab, take a look at the following video. It showcases how one team in the Advisory made use of new features rolled out in Digital Lab last month to completely change the way they perform a certain type of analysis on their projects. Have your own great idea about how to leverage Digital Lab assets to transform client delivery? Stay tuned for an expanded Advisory Idea Contest rolling out in the month of July. Your bright idea could be one of several selected to be built out with help from the PwC Labs team during our Advisory “hack-a-thon”!

Advisory June 14, 2019 As discussed over the last two Fridays, Talent Exchange functionality coming later this month will allow you more flexibility in structuring agreements with independent talent. You’ll be able to offer Daily and Weekly rates on time-based roles, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Today, learn about how to leverage incentive fees. After onboarding talent for a time-based role, you will have the option to amend the engagement to include a one-time incentive fee for each project. This amendment will require approval from the role’s Engagement Leader and they will have to confirm they’ve had an offline conversation with their Vertical Operations Leader approving the payment. Once the amendment is approved, talent will be able to submit the incentive payment through their project’s regular T&amp;E portal. Like all submitted T&amp;E, it will need to be approved by the engagement manager. Take a look at the key benefits and considerations below to learn more! Key Benefits For PwC For Talent Additional tool to incentivize talent Could be used to motivate work completion in a shorter duration, retention of talent for an additional project phase Additional revenue source for increased efforts. Key Considerations This feature can only be used one time for time-based roles and is intended to be used infrequently. Incentive fees require offline approval from the team’s Vertical Operations Leader and will appear on WIPs as expense disbursements. If multiple talent are working together on one project, please keep this in mind when considering an incentive fee for an individual. Given tax implications, individuals in MBO Partners’ Payroll Services are not eligible for incentive fees. Payroll Services contractors are identified by “Hourly Projects Only” on their talent card. Still with us? Great work! Submit a way in which you think an incentive fee can benefit / be used on your project for a chance to win a $50 Amazon gift card. Again, the more questions you answer, the better your chances of winning! You can still answer questions from previous weeks to increase your odds. See the official contest rules here.

You see SLAN uses Excel spreadsheets to manage configuration data before uploading en masse into the application. The team recognized right away that the amount of repetitive manual Excel activities not only increased chances of human error, but also exposed the project to timeline delays. The solution was looking us dead in the eye, but the problem was, no one on our team had the time or the full knowledge to build a solution themselves. Manish Dharnidharka Advisory partner “We reached out to some contacts we had on the Digital Lab team, explained our problem and we quickly got to work,” added Richard Cebula, managing director in our TMT vertical. Digital Lab Solution With the help of Mike Huwyler and Joe Kressler, the Digital Lab team helped build two apps/tools: A data transformation process flow that would take one “golden company code” and apply the same configuration for the remaining 121 company codes in each of the 52 tabs in the SLAN Excel template. A process automation (bot) that took individual pieces of configuration data from the SLAN Development environment and applied it into the SLAN Excel template for the next environment (Test or Production) The Win By using data analysis and automation on this engagement, the following benefits were realized: Time saved. The data transformation process flow ran in under five minutes for an activity that would have taken a human 16 hours; not only on time, but every time a configuration update was required by the client. The automation program ran in under 10 minutes for an activity that would have taken a day or more to do at least 4x (1x for each environment). Overall saving 160+ man-hours. Accuracy. By using process automation, the project team avoided any human error that would have resulted in 60+ hours of error resolution and correction. Re-use.

The boxes were packed with items meant to bring a moment of joy to the families while their child is being treated at a nearby hospital. The team delivered the packed boxes, along with special notes, to siblings and parents who were beyond grateful for the generosity. One mother was excited to use the items to decorate her son’s room and one of the siblings really enjoyed the stuffed frog in his box.

Office Depot is an industry leader in the office products retail space. However, the changing retail model from big-box to online has led to significant revenue and EBITDA pressure. To reinvent their business, and maintain their dominant industry position, Office Depot is transforming into a business services company -- accelerated by the acquisition of CompuCom, a leader in the IT services and business management space. This acquisition, and services-oriented transformation, is turning Office Depot’s business upside down. Rather than the retail outlet serving as the business generator for sales, they are shifting focus to enterprise business relationships serving as the sales catalyst, with Office Depot office products as a ‘pull through.’ Both Office Depot and CompuCom were running on Oracle’s on-premise Enterprise Business Suite (EBS) as independent businesses. To enable the business transformation, they invested in Oracle Cloud ERP, Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) and Human Capital Management (HCM) product suites. In the new world, Office Depot and CompuCom need to become unified with the implementation of Oracle Cloud platform. What was our proposed solution for Office Depot and how did we win? With our One Firm approach, PwC brought the best of our Fit for Growth (FFG) platform strategy and approach with the Finance Transformation Integrated Solution to design a compelling proposal for the Office Depot business and technology transformation. We demonstrated our expertise and differentiation through a live prototype testing phase based on PwC’s preconfigured Oracle Cloud model system, which leverages our expertise and learnings from previous clients in the same sector to streamline configuration of a blank Oracle environment with settings that drive industry specific leading practices. This was a key accelerator of the Finance Transformation Integrated Solution. Office Depot saw this as a differentiator from our competition and a significant value add to their success. We provided a clear vision of what we could deliver and how we are best suited to enable Office Depot’s business and technology evolution. Our One Firm team demonstrated deep technical and business acumen, knowledge and expertise in delivering comparable solutions for other clients. We were seen as innovative, as exemplified by the parallel General Ledger approach, the model system to expedite process design, and the automated PMO tool. What results will Office Depot see using our solution? Report rationalization: relying on out-of-box reporting and Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence resulted in 70% reduction of hours in custom reporting. Overall reduction of 14K hours per year and consolidation of multiple data warehouse systems. We helped Office Depot develop a comprehensive business case and cloud application roadmap strategy with anticipated benefits of $22-30M per year. Streamlined ‘Contracts to Cash’ process and system optimization using Oracle Cloud. Consumption-based billing and consolidated invoicing, helping Office Depot /Compucom build a more efficient order and delivery model. By deploying the Oracle Cloud Project Portfolio Management (PPM) Cloud Solution, we increased the speed of contract creation by 30%, which will result in 5%-7% improvement in bottom line profit. What was significant about this win for us? Rebuilt a strained relationship with Office Depot by leveraging the support of our CREs. Significant xLoS collaboration and teamwork with the use of Tax, organizational change management and Acceleration Centers (formerly called SDCs). Example to include with submission for an Oracle Excellence Award and a significant investment in Oracle alliance partnership, with stories to tell together within the marketplace to support future transformations leveraging our Integrated Solutions. Leveraged our global Oracle practice and their Office Depot relationships to continue expanding the client’s Oracle Cloud footprint including successful past implementations in the Netherlands and Hong Kong. Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

Enter and synchronize your time: Entering your time daily is important every day -- but it’s especially important at the end of the fiscal year. Ensure all of your time is accurately entered and synchronized no later than Friday, June 28 by 8:00 p.m. ET. We need everyone to deliver the hours committed within FlexForecast/TalentLink for Advisory and our firm to achieve budget. 2. Complete your Digital Quests: While there are a number of ways to get digitally upskilled, we’ve all been working toward one common goal -- to earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badges by June 30. If you haven’t completed all four digital quests, now is the time! 3. Keep Salesforce opportunities current: Salesforce is a big driver of our forecast -- we use it to make business decisions on staffing and investments, and we need accurate data to get July off to a strong start. Please update your Salesforce opportunities with the latest amount, stage, close date, and start/end dates. 4. Ensure FlexForecast ETCs are current: Last month, we discussed how we’re renovating FlexForecast, and we continue to make progress in improving its performance and stability. Reach out to your Vertical Finance Teams with any concerns; they can help guide you through the latest enhancements. We appreciate your continued patience as we get Flex operating again like the exceptional tool that it is. 5. Set your out of office and disconnect! Checklist complete? You’re all set to relax and recharge. Have a great break!

Bunge Limited was looking to assess and enhance their global compliance program, with a focus on bribery and corruption risks specific to third-party management and monitoring of higher risk activities. While going through this process, they wanted to preserve the brand trust established during their 200 operational years and equip the company to better face anti-bribery and anti-corruption (ABAC) compliance challenges of today, tomorrow and into the future. What was our solution for Bunge? We held a brainstorming workshop with Bunge’s compliance team and shared real-time ideas with them to drive enhancements on the design and execution of their ABAC Compliance Program, particularly related to third-party risk management and monitoring activities. The team leveraged the framework of our ABAC Integrated Solution, including our methodology to help clients prepare for, respond to and emerge stronger from compliance challenges, and demos of certain proprietary digital assets. Our broad and cross-functional approach was driven by a team with diverse functional and sector experience and was enabled through the demonstration of digital assets, for example compliance tracker, offering the ability to provide clarity around key risks and visibility into the unknown. Delivering the solution with a BXT approach, from a consumer perspective, wowed the Bunge leadership team who said, "there was a consensus at Bunge about the quality of your work and the presentation." What results will Bunge see using our solution? The use of a technology enabled solution should help Bunge to increase efficiencies in monitoring execution which will deliver increased value to the organization, through the following: -Centralized web-based platform (Compliance Tracker) to manage the monitoring analytics, execution and reporting -Case management to track potential compliance matters from identification through remediation, with customizable workflow and audit trail -Tailored monitoring summary dashboards to simplify and visualize results for management and executives. -Automation of data processing, analytics, and on-demand reporting. More visibility and clarity into risks and the unknown, allowing Bunge to make better strategic and tactical decisions in managing its business in various complex locations on a global basis. More consistent view of key areas of risk and higher risk third parties on a go forward basis. Lessons learned from certain locations that can be applied to the business in a broader manner. How is this win significant and what results will we see? A substantial margin delivered for the firm at ~34%. A showcase in Advisory 2.0 strategic agenda with the use of an Integrated Solution, a BXT approach and Your Tomorrow digital usage focus. A streamlined, digital approach that can be consistently applied across xLoS PwC engagements by leveraging the Digital Compliance &amp; Fraud Office (DCFO) technology tool, Compliance Tracker. Enhanced relationships across functional areas at the company and a strong showing of our Risk and Regulatory platform messaging- focusing the complexity of risk into a powerful business strategy by helping clients proactively understand and evolve with the changing global regulatory landscape. Ability to identify other areas where we may be able to add value for the client and introduce others to bring new ideas. New insights to showcase on our recently launched Anti-bribery Anti-corruption external webpage! Meet the team! This was truly a team effort and we had close interactions and support from the account team, from the GEP (Peter Frank) to the client driver (Donna Panettiere).

We’re talking more than 250 ideas submitted by YOU in a span of mere weeks. What’s more, these submissions have come from across every one of the Advisory verticals and Go to Market teams, showing that automation potential isn’t limited to just one area of our business. Last Friday, we showcased three great ideas submitted for the Challenge so far on our Advisory All Hands webcast - and added a fun twist of a live poll to send one of these teams straight to the Hackathon finals! Utilities Rate Testing Bot - Automates the process for rates configuration/billing testing within Oracle or SAP billing systems, reducing data review time and risk of manual error or material discrepancy; offers potential savings of up to 400 hours every time automation is run (12x/month). Automated Salesforce Configuration Workbook - Automates the process of pushing Salesforce design/configuration inputs from a workbook directly into the Salesforce environment without having to configure through the UI; offers potential savings of 4 hours every time automation is run (100x/month). Deals Diligence Automation Suite - An end-to-end suite of tools to automate much of the deals diligence process, including data intake and processing workflows and standard visualization packages that can be produced in hours vs. weeks; offers potential savings of 30 hours every time automation is run (10x/month). Congrats to the team behind the Salesforce configuration workbook, who won the “golden ticket” with more than 40% of the audience vote! They'll be headed straight to the Hackathon finals next month to bring their idea to life in front of Advisory leaders.

Each week, we’ll dig into some of the best ways you can take your Digital Insights plan to the next level. By now, you’ve heard from your Business Unit Leaders about Digital Insights -- a big helping hand that will make it easier for us to choose and implement the right solutions for our engagements. Getting started is easy, and takes only five to ten minutes at the start of engagement planning. But once you’ve taken the first step, and created a plan what should you do next? It’s as simple as getting your team together over some pizza -- or a Google hangout. Set aside time to pause, reflect and plan as a team before the start of a project. Talk with each other about the solutions you’ve laid out, what might be missing and what the impact of those solutions might be. The agenda can be loose and free-flowing -- but what’s important is that everyone has a voice. Want to take your lunch meeting to the next level? Invite a Digital Accelerator, or conference in a team member from the Acceleration Centers (formerly GDM). Your colleagues are already putting Digital Insights plans into action, starting with low-key virtual and/or in person lunch meetings or Google hangouts. Discuss all the possibilities for how you can deliver differently, without sacrificing Quality. Consider discussing topics such as: Your staffing mix and staffing levels - who might you free up? How can we better leverage alternative labor? The number of reviews the engagement requires How you can best leverage Acceleration Centers and Digital Accelerators Connecting the dots on FlexForecast/TalentLink Getting the right value for the services we deliver, by using the Smart Pricing Tool How we can better deliver the Client Experience and the tech-enabled service our clients want? Stay tuned for future articles in this series where we’ll dig deeper into these topics. If you’re looking for guidance or tech support, just reach out to P5M Answers via live chat, email: US_P5MAnswers@pwc.com, or phone (646-471-6848) - the Project 5 Million team will work to resolve your issue completely within 24 hours.

The OFRO Tax self-study series is required for associates, senior associates, and managers hired before 1/1/18 and associates - managing directors hired after 1/1/18 and should be completed within the timeframe noted on Tax Source or prior to promotion to the next staff level. As a reminder, for staff who were promoted on 7/1/19, OFRO promotion requirements are due on 11/27/19. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators that oversee our profession, as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the OFRO Tax expectations are for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients supported by documentation in DMS and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility. Completion requirements: OFRO Tax self-study series should be completed within the timeframe specified. Visit Tax Source for a list of course completion requirements by staff level and hire date. Promotions to the next staff level carry a OFRO Tax training completion requirement in FY20, similar to the annual CPE requirement. Note to Managers &amp; above: On July 30, a number of the courses were deactivated from the Manager and above curricula and new versions are currently being developed. Those impacted by these changes were notified via email on July 11. We will deploy new versions as they are completed, beginning in August.

Focused on driving Your Tomorrow - Project 5 Million goals, Tax director Abe Sedgh and his team took a fresh look at their end-to-end engagement processes, identifying a number of areas for efficiencies and automation. With the knowledge of the old process combined with tech skills, Senior Manager Gulam Ansari was trained as a Digital Accelerator and helped the team develop automation solutions to remove bottlenecks in the process, reduce manual work on the federal side of the engagement and improve customizations related to a scope including income tax provision and income tax compliance work for approximately 250 entities. Additional capacity created by the new digital solutions has been redirected for team members to deepen their knowledge of the more technical tax areas of the return, including areas impacted by tax reform. “Having two years of experience with the client was helpful,” said Gulam. “We brainstormed and took a hard look at all of our processes. We identified pain points where we could make our work more efficient and created digital solutions that helped us work smarter. We also looked at how we could deliver for the client on a quarterly basis.” The digital solutions were selected based on priority areas determined by feedback from the client and team goals for reducing hours and was implemented in phases. They kept the client in the loop and showed them customized outputs based on their preferences. Simplifying the complex The team focused on reimagining the possible for their income tax provision and compliance work. The first phase was implementation of quarterly tax provision solutions in November 2018. The impact was significant and immediately felt by the team. This year, working remotely three team members were able to complete the provision calculation in a matter of hours, in contrast to 10-15 staff last year. The second phase focused on the tax compliance process. By working closely with our Acceleration Centers, the team was able to achieve high quality work product with faster turnaround times. With automated solutions the team was able to: Create an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool to automate the input of data, workpaper processing, as well as analytics to support the tax return deliverable, with an annual savings of 4,000 hours Reduce time spent providing tax provision support each quarter from 300-400 hours to under 100 hours, with an annual time saving of 1,500 hours Developed a Depreciation ETL model to substantiate tax basis in fixed assets saving an estimated 500 hours Provided customizations and analytics to provide more useful information for the client “It’s been great to see everyone get onboard and dig in,” said Abe. “The team now is able to work differently as a result of increasing digital capabilities to create more capacity that in turn is being used to add more value to the client.” Visit Digital Lab to learn more The solutions that the team created for their engagement are now available here on Digital Lab: Form 1120 Automation with Client Ready Workpapers and OIT Import File Tax Provision Automation General Ledger Manager (GLM) Trial Balance Import Depreciation Gross Timing Difference Calculation with Form 4562 Import for OIT Want to change your processes and enhance work within your team?

This team consists of industry certified professionals who know how to frame responses that demonstrate PwC's strong security stance. Please note, due to the volume of requests they process, the standard turnaround time for a questionnaire is five working days. A Client's data security inquiry could include an inquiry about our general security controls, sometimes extensive written assessments/questionnaires, and even intensive security audits. The staff members of the Client Interactions &amp; Contracts team are experienced in addressing data security matters and can assist an engagement team in the following ways: participate in conference calls with client IT security, identify appropriate documentation or evidence of our security policies and practices, and communicate security standards that address existing concerns in ways that avoid raising new concerns. There are two Business Services questionnaire forms for an engagement team to select from, and complete, to initiate an assistance request from this group: The Client has sent us their security evaluation questionnaire to be filled out - email your completed Business Services – Client Security Questionnaires and the Client's questionnaire document to GBL_Client-Security-Interactions@pwc.com. The Client is requiring specific contract provisions, and help is needed in negotiating the contract security terms - email your completed Business Services – Client Contracts and the Master Services Agreement (MSA), Engagement Letter (EL), Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), Request For Proposal (RFP), Business Associate Agreements (BAA) or other document received from the client to GBL_NIS-Client-Contracts@pwc.com. Note: If the client's data security inquiry is expected to lead to modifications to the engagement contract, involving your local tax risk management partner in initial correspondence will expedite the contracting process.

Ready, set, go: Here’s the PCS Tax Busy Season Toolkit! Tax July 31, 2019 Tax practitioners, As we begin another tax busy season, the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO, formerly Q&amp;RM) and Tax Knowledge Management (TKM) teams want to provide you with relevant resources to help you understand recent legislative changes, IRS issues, and risk management initiatives impacting your compliance efforts. Accordingly, the PCS Tax Busy Season Toolkit highlights resources found in Tax Source that will help you serve your clients during the remainder of 2019. Consider bookmarking this page so that the toolkit is easily accessible. Please pay special attention to IRS due dates, as well as the penalty waiver for certain individuals whose tax withholding and estimated tax payments fell short in 2018. In addition, refer to the Tax Reform home page for various materials that may be helpful in connection with 2019 tax provision reviews and estimated tax payment calculations. Because tax reform guidance continues to be somewhat of a moving target, make sure to consult this toolkit for updates that will help you in managing all of the complexities associated with your client work. Familiarize yourself with the compliance and technology resources within the PCS Tax Transformation site and Digital Lab (including the 'Tax Delivery Maps' found under 'Collections') to help streamline your engagements. Use the P5M Hours Saved tracker to log the hours you save by leveraging technology. When engagements are complete, ensure documentation of our work is properly included in DMS (not in emails, My Drive, etc.). Finally, regularly visit the OFRO home page for other valuable information and tools. Special thanks to Reed Sands and Denise Dockrey for providing TKM support associated with this toolkit. As always, we welcome your suggestions. If you have any ideas about how to make this toolkit more relevant to the practice, please contact Reed Sands at (503) 267-4739, or me.

Phoenix for Tax - Do you have questions? Tax Aug. 14, 2019 FAQ’s: Why can’t I find my service? Practice Area should be selected based on the work being sent. In addition, the associated services chosen when forecasting should match that of the Engagement. You should not mix and match services from different Practice Areas. How do I correct the error I get when I try to submit a service request? Populate your desired Service and #of Items in your Engagement forecast prior to requesting the service to avoid delays when work is ready to be submitted. Why do I have to submit service requests anyway? Not only do your requests provide the necessary information for the AC staff to complete the work, but also helps the AC management team manage their staff. Request details are automatically fed to a resource management tool used by the AC to assist in scheduling and capacity management. This ensures that staff are fully utilized at all times to provide you with the most effective and efficient turnaround times. Will I get notified when my work is completed? Keep an eye out for Phoenix emails entitled “Delivery Sprints have been delivered”. Failure to take action on this Task will result in cluttered widgets for both you and our Acceleration Center (AC) staff. This Tasks also provides the opportunity for you to utilize the “Rework” and/or “Review Complete” functionality to keep your AC teams organized. Is there a way to give my AC Team Feedback? Feedback can be provided upon completion of each sprint within Phoenix when clicking the Review Complete button. Help us improve! Where can I go for additional help? Visit the Phoenix Spark page and Phoenix Support for additional resources. Join our Phoenix Forum for urgent announcements and real time help from other users. Will I have to recreate my engagement next year? One of the key features coming in the September release for Phoenix is Roll Forward functionality. Your current year Engagement will be used as a template for next year’s Engagement. Key information, including your forecast, will be copied over and you will have the ability to edit for adjustments year to year. This will happen automatically on the end date of your current year engagements. For those utilizing Engagement Center (EC) this will happen upon manually rolling forward your EC Engagement. Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to our release date!

The timing of engagement teams obtaining an approved AFS as part of the engagement set-up process matters in terms of complying with our independence policy. As illustrated below, an AFS form must be approved by the Responsible Partner listed in CES prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. (Note, when providing certain services, you may need to obtain AFS approval from a Secondary Independence Reviewer by adding "US AFSReview" as an Approver on the AFS – see link.) When providing non-audit services to a restricted entity and/or their affiliates, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check CES and the GPA list; If restricted, initiate AFS &amp; engagement assessment process Receive AFS approval (or a notification AFS, if GPA only) from Responsible Partner in CES Complete engagement acceptance assessment Execute engagement contract Begin work The foregoing "sequence" is an essential part of maintaining our independence with respect to non-audit services (a professional responsibility for each of us to manage on our engagements). Best practices to keep in mind: An AFS is required for all non-audit services provided to restricted entities and/or their affiliates and global priority accounts listed in the Central Entity Service (CES) system and/or in the Global Priority Account (GPA) list included on the Global Client Portal (most easily accessed from the Engagement Acceptance Assessment). Note, a restriction designation is more than an entity being an audit client of the firm. An AFS is required for all restricted entities and/or their affiliates as designated in CES. An approved AFS must be obtained prior to executing an engagement contract with a restricted client and/or their affiliates. An approved AFS must be obtained prior to starting work on the engagement – Tax Time Charging Policy. If the nature of the services changes from what was included in the original and approved AFS, a new AFS and updated contract may be required. Engagement teams should consult with the Responsible Partner in CES to determine if a new AFS is required. If required, a new AFS must be submitted and approved prior to the execution of the amended/revised engagement contract and the commencement of work. If the Responsible Partner determines that a new AFS is not required, the engagement team should document the conclusion in the DMS Administrative folder. If the CES database indicates that an AFS is required, and you believe the CES database does not contain the correct information regarding the restriction status of a client, submit an AFS and consult with the Responsible Partner listed in CES. If an AFS is not required according to the Responsible Partner, the engagement team should document the conclusion and file it in the DMS Administrative folder. Engagement teams should prepare an AFS for each year/12 month period of a multi-year contract.(Note: a multi-year engagement does not require a new AFS if the scope of services does not change.) It is important that all engagement team members be aware of and comply with our non-audit service independence policies, by understanding the rules and the procedures to be followed to facilitate overall team compliance. For additional information regarding the AFS process -- including assessing permissibility of services, the AFS Process Sequence, protocols regarding Charging Time, and Scope Creep -- see the Tax Independence – AFS Quick Reference.

Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” What do seven days, 545 miles and cycling have in common? The annual AIDS/LifeCycle event...and our own Noah Figdor. From June 2-8, Noah joined over 100 other PwC xLoS team members in raising nearly $500,000 to fund HIV/AIDS services and increase HIV/AIDS awareness. This was PwC’s fourth year participating in AIDS/LifeCycle, where over 3,000 cyclists came together to join the fight in ending AIDS. “The most memorable aspect of the ride was the comradery I felt with my PwC team members and other riders who are also mission driven. I couldn’t have done it without my Tax team. I received an outpour of support from everyone in the San Jose office — so much so that I exceeded my fundraising goal and raised it twice,” said Noah. When asked what inspired him to participate, Noah shared his personal commitment to community involvement. Outside PwC, Noah is an avid participant in the non-profit space. He is a member of the Leadership Development Jewish Federation, on the board of a non-profit called Hebrew Free Loan, and is the development director of a non-profit he co-started called NJB-SF. Noah has been with the firm for four years in the Core Tax team, and he is currently on tour as a Digital Accelerator. He is part of the San Jose Tax Advisory Group and is a co-lead of Shine, PwC’s LGBT+ network, within his local office. “Noah embodies what our ‘Work Together’ value means to me. Whether it's Noah being one of the sole tax representatives participating in the AIDS/LifeCycle team or his teaming across tax BUs as a Digital Accelerator, his ultimate passion in life is to ensure we're all learning from and with each other,” said Tax partner Michael Chin. Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

As we digitize work through Your Tomorrow and Project 5 Million, improving firm business processes will be critical to recognizing value from our investments in innovation and our people. These updated business processes will provide greater simplification for our engagement teams. Updated FlexForecast business rules Current Tax business rules require all engagements with more than 20 hours to use FlexForecast to budget and monitor engagements. However, input from our staff and partners indicates that FlexForecast’s budgeting and monitoring functionality may not be as useful when managing smaller engagements. Based on your feedback, we are updating the FlexForecast business rules for FY20. We heard you! Beginning July 1, 2019, engagements that are less than 200 hours will not require a detailed budget or deployment hours in FlexForecast. Individual WBS codes on large engagements do not qualify. This only applies when the total hours on the engagement are less than 200. Note that the term "engagement" refers to the total contract. For example, if a compliance engagement has Fed, State, and ITS, and the ITS piece is under 200 hours but the overall engagement is more than 200 hours, ITS still needs a budget tab as part of the overall engagement budget. As another example, the same would apply to a Global Structuring engagement with multiple small pieces - we still need to see all the pieces if the whole engagement is more than 200 hours. Teams will only be required to submit the following information in the aggregate in MyEngage when requesting a WBS code: Expected Revenue, IPR%, Expected EM% and Total Hours (&lt; 200 hours) The Deployment team will work with small engagements to account for expected time in TalentLink, using block bookings for groups of smaller engagements which may share staff. If you have questions, please reach out to your finance contact, Project Management Driver or Deployment team in your market.

Heading into year two of this effort, I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished and am excited about the year ahead — and the roadmap we have to use along the way. As we start the new fiscal year, I’m pleased to share our One Firm and FY20 Tax Expectations, which support our focus on upskilling, use of the tools we have to help simplify our processes and Be well, work well. It also includes guidance for business development, financial discipline, quality and our People experience. This is a resource for you to use throughout the year with your teams, in discussions with your Relationship Leader and in coaching conversations, as it outlines what we expect from each staff level and how you’ll be assessed in the FY20 CRTs. Digitizing and removing hours means we’ve lowered our total hours, which means we’ve lowered utilization and lowered the overtime hours expectations across staff levels. This is all part of our Project 5 Million journey, and even though we’ve lowered utilization goals, not all staff are yet feeling those effects the same way — which is why we need to continue to digitize to help everyone experience the capacity we’re creating. Please review and start planning for your FY20 success and growth, using your Development Team to refine expectations specific to your career development and business unit goals. Thank you for your continued contributions to our practice.

A joint business relationship (JBR) between PwC and another entity or person may include activities ranging from joint marketing and proposals to joint service offerings and oversight. A JBR can even result just from being a presenter at a conference or other public venue. Alliances and other recurring joint business relationships can present significant market growth opportunities for PwC as they can generate lucrative professional services revenues and provide an effective way to broaden our ability to deliver a wide range of high quality services to our clients. However, alliances and other JBRs can also pose significant risks and potential issues when not engaged or managed appropriately. The Business Relationships: Independence guidance link provides a framework for identifying and evaluating situations that may create a JBR and: describes attributes and other factors that help us determine whether a JBR is direct or indirect, provides examples of direct and indirect JBRs, as well as situations which would not be considered JBRs by applying the framework to different scenarios, and summarizes the process for evaluating, approving and tracking JBRs.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between April 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019, you should contact Nick Nebolsine (571-332-9690) or Karen Jones (703-622-8971) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez 703-963-5641 for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

This is true even if the professional is not an accountant. IESBA issued a pronouncement that defines what you must do if you become aware of illegal or potentially illegal activities of a client. This pronouncement, titled “Responding to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations” is commonly called “NOCLAR” and was incorporated into our US Risk Management Policies for Consulting Services effective July 15, 2017. Understanding your professional obligations All PwC personnel, even if you are not an auditor or a public accountant, must follow our Five Step Approach to facilitate the evaluation and reporting of any potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that comes to their attention, regardless of whether the acts occurred before or after the pronouncement was issued. 1. Become aware - once becoming aware, timely action is required; 2. Seek to obtain an understanding of the matter - the nature of and circumstances surrounding the act; Then, in consultation with Risk Management or OGC: 3. Communicate with others - determine appropriate individuals for notification; 4. Determine further need for action - evaluate factors related to the potential non-compliance; 5. Document - the matter, actions taken, response by client, and that the professional obligation is met. What do you need to know? You are not expected to seek out NOCLAR unless that is the stated purpose of the engagement. Consult with your engagement leader as soon as practicable if you become aware of non-compliance or potential non-compliance. Engagement leaders should consult in a timely manner with Risk Management or OGC. If the non-compliance or potential non-compliance is related to PwC, you may also contact the Ethics and Compliance hotline to begin escalation procedures as necessary. To find out more about what NOCLAR covers and how IESBA defines NOCLAR please refer to US Tax Policy-Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations. For more information, contact Corina Trainer (M: 240-938-0441) or Nayan Bhihka (M: 703-964-6275) or reach out to another member of the OFRO Tax team.

Document substantive verbal advi Have you spoken to your client today? Document substantive verbal advice and emails in DMS Tax July 18, 2019 It’s critical to keep in mind the importance of documenting our work, including significant discussions -- internally and with the client -- throughout the engagement. All substantive client discussions related to the engagement -- including phone calls -- should be documented and included in the engagement file in DMS. Engagement teams should use professional judgment in deciding which client discussions and/or phone calls are “of substance” to the engagement, as well as in the overall preparation of the documentation. It’s recommended that engagement teams review the Documentation Toolkit for guidance on appropriate documentation. Useful tools and templates are available in the Toolkit to assist with the documentation process, such as a template that can be used to document verbal advice provided during client discussions and phone calls. The “File to TaxDMS” button - a Chrome extension available for download from the PwC Chrome Store - makes it easier to file Google emails and email attachments to DMS with a few simple clicks. Access this File to DMS from Gmail - Quick Reference Guide for instructions on how to add and use the “File to TaxDMS” button. As a reminder, the quality and contemporaneous filing of appropriate documentation for engagements is formally being assessed as part of the Tax Office Review program, including the documentation of substantive client discussions related to the engagement. For additional information related to the Tax Office Review Documentation Evaluation, please access this link for a template of the assessment and relevant help guidance.

So, you created your Digital Insights plan and scheduled some time to discuss the impact with your team. Now -- you might be wondering how your colleagues are using Digital Insights to spark new ways of working. Many of our teams are finding that once they’ve made a plan for maximizing digital solutions on your project,we can rethink our team’s staffing mix and staffing levels, by asking some simple questions, such as: Can the Manager or Senior Manager on the project work directly with the Partner -- freeing up the director previously assigned to spend more time in the market with clients? Can we go with 4 people instead of 5 on the engagement, freeing up staff to focus on building relationships in the market? How can we leverage the Acceleration Centers (formerly GDM), other alternative staffing resources (e.g. Flexible Talent Network or Talent Exchange), and Digital Accelerators to help us deliver differently? As we digitize and monitor engagement economics, are we updating staffing hours and needs in FlexForecast/TalentLink to help us staff appropriately? Looking for more ideas, guidance or tech support?

It’s almost Apple picking season! PwC Technology Aug. 26, 2019 Apple traditionally releases the latest news about iPhones in September — maybe we’ll get a juicy new model this year, maybe we won’t. Either way, if you’re curious if you’re due for a smartphone upgrade, find out in two shakes of a lightning cable by following these steps: Access the eMobility Portal and locate the Assets box. In the Upgrade Eligible/Date column, you’ll either see “Upgrade now” or your future eligibility date. Only smartphones are eligible. When you’re ready to order a new device, select Upgrade Now — more details here. What does upgrade eligible date "N/A" mean? You’ll see N/A for a number that’s not associated with a smartphone (such as an iPad or MiFi) or for numbers recently transferred into eMobility. If you believe your smartphone is upgrade eligible but your upgrade date shows N/A, submit this short form. Have questions? We’ll be standing by with answers on Friday, Sept. 6 For now, we only have rumors about the newest iPhone — but we have hard facts about eMobility and upgrades. Post your questions on our live online Q&amp;A. We’ll answer questions about all devices, upgrades and apps. Android fans, you’re welcome too! We’ll answer questions in real time on Friday, Sept. 6 from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. ET. If you post outside that period, you’ll still get an answer — it just won’t be immediate. Stay tuned for more! When will a (potentially) new iPhone be available for preorder? What will it cost? Well, no one knows yet. As soon as we have those answers, we’ll report back. Plus, exciting changes are coming for our mobile infrastructure. Watch HQ for all the latest news. Wait to update your iOS We anticipate Apple will also announce an iOS update. Just a reminder — PwC Technology recommends you wait two to three weeks to upgrade. This allows developers (including PwC) to make updates so their apps work well with the new version. After our teams verify everything’s okay, we'll give you a green light. To learn more, visit our eMobility Spark site. Visit PwC’s Service Hub for technology help and resources.

With the click of a button, the Google-matic default email &amp; browser changer bot digs into your PC’s settings to switch your default email to Google Mail and your default browser to Chrome. That way, when you click on an embedded email link on any website, Chrome will open a new Google Mail message. No more waiting for Notes to lumber to life. No more pasting email addresses between platforms. No more shaking your fist at your screen. Run the Google-matic bot to save time and frustration. How do you run that bot? Go to the Google-matic bot in Digital Lab Select “Download to run” to install the bot. Open UiPath from your system tray (located at the bottom-right side of your desktop). Next to the bot name, select download Select the “Run” button and the bot will run a one-time execution to update all related PC settings. (This will take just a moment — don’t use your PC while it’s running.) Similar to other bots, UiPath and UiPath Robot Runner must be installed on your PC (available from Software Center). In addition, you must download the UiPath Chrome extension, and it must be running. Chrome extension troubles? If you experience Chrome extension troubles (like an error message that says the bot cannot communicate with the browser), there’s a bot for that, too! #PwCTech Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/firmwide/pwc-technology/know_service_hub.html</url><pwc_title>Tech tip: Know how, know where, know Service Hub</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-25 23:16:58</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>pwc:news-type/firmwide,pwc:source/pwc-technology</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>Got a glitch?

Tech tip: Throw a Google Search Party! PwC Technology June 17, 2019 Our workhack turns any Google Chrome browser URL bar into a powerful Google Cloud Search engine — helping you quickly locate hard-to-find information. Until now, setting up this hack has been a bit cumbersome. This bot automates the setup — run it once, and soon you’ll be searching your Google universe in seconds. After you run this bot, you can search across all your G Suite content in a flash: all you need to do is type “search” (followed by a space and your search terms) into your Google Chrome address bar. Hit enter, and Cloud Search quickly scans everything in your G Suite to find exactly what you’re looking for — across Google Mail, Calendar, Drive, Folders, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Keep and more. Download the bot now to simplify your searches. Similar to other bots, UiPath and UiPath Robot Runner must be installed on your PC (available from Software Center). In addition, you must download the UiPath Chrome extension and it must be running. Chrome Extension troubles? If you experience Chrome Extension troubles (like an error message that says the bot cannot communicate with the browser), there’s a bot for that, too! What is Google Cloud Search anyway? Google Cloud Search uses artificial intelligence to help you sift through all your PwC Google content. Plus it provides recommendations to help you prepare for upcoming meetings, proposals and more. The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes — Cloud Search learns from your searches and interactions so it can help you through your day. Want more tips and technology news?

Find out who's behind that note by using Google Cloud Search to quickly run a reverse phone number lookup.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/firmwide/pwc-technology/Meet_audio_tips.html</url><pwc_title>Can you hear me now?

How to be heard on Meet Can you hear me now? How to be heard on Meet PwC Technology Aug. 5, 2019 Follow these audio tips to have a “sound” meeting on Google Meet. Plug it in, plug it in: When using Google Meet in a PwC conference room, everyone gets the best experience by using the built-in technology where available (speakers, screens, cameras, etc.). Be sure to connect your laptop to both the HDMI and USB cables, and do not use wireless presentation, as it can cause audio issues. Hot tip for HP: If you have an HP laptop, your mic may be configured to block background noise (i.e., everything but the person directly in front of the laptop). To configure it for use with a group, click the Bang &amp; Olufsen (B&amp;O) icon in the lower-right corner → Microphone Experience → Conference. Lucky caller #6: When there are more than five participants, Meet will auto-mute all new joiners. Just select the unmute button on your PC or app; if you joined the Meet by phone, hit *6. Beware the mute hat-trick: What’s on mute — your Meet, your laptop, your headset? If others can’t hear you, check all your mute options: To see if you’re muted in Meet, look for the red mute icon. To see if you’re muted through your laptop, look for a button with a microphone icon (often with a slash or x through or next to it). If you’re using a headset, that device might also have a mute button. Check (all) your settings: To view the sound settings in Meet, select the three vertical dots and click “Settings.” Prior to plugging in the HDMI cable in the conference room, the instructions/settings for Meet are listed on the TV screen.

Enhancements to CES and AFS coming soon Who doesn’t love an upgrade? Enhancements to CES and AFS coming soon One Firm Risk Organization July 22, 2019 Later this summer, we’re launching enhancements to the Central Entity Service (CES) and Authorisation for Services (AFS) — our tools to manage restricted clients and authorize services we provide them. Core to our Continuous Improvement efforts, we’re making these tools simpler and more intuitive. Plus, they’ll be mobile-enabled, so you can access them on the go. Before these tools go live, how can you prepare? From August 9 to August 18, there will be intermittent, short-term disruptions to the availability and functionality of AFS, CES, Rapid Engage, Astro and Independence Checkpoint. Explore our AFS/CES guidance for more information on what to do during this period, along with the resources available to you. We’re transitioning to the new systems now to minimize disruptions to you and your team, as August is the slowest time of year for these tools. We’ll share more in the coming weeks in PwC Inside and on HQ. Take the following actions by August 8: Initiate, submit and/or approve AFSs to avoid delays due to system disruptions. This will ensure your ability to serve clients is not impacted while the legacy systems are down to prepare for go-live of the new tools. Please note: If you have an urgent need during the shutdown of AFS, a workaround process will be available here. This process is intended to be accessed for exceptional cases only. Ensure your client hierarchies are up to date. CES will be read-only beginning August 9 through August 18. Pre-clear your personal investments in Independence Checkpoint if you’re planning to make changes to your or your immediate family members’ personal investments. Still have questions? You can refer to our AFS/CES guidance and find more information on the global Spark project page.

To make sure we put our best foot forward in publications, as speakers at events and through other channels, as well as help minimize risks, follow these steps before you communicate publicly on behalf of PwC: 1. Consult with the firm’s marketing and external communications teams. They will help you through the public communications review process -- everything from guiding you through the Self-Review checklist to assessing whether your public communications require review by the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO). Consult with your marketer and external communications contact as early as possible to avoid a delay in approvals. 2. Make sure your communication is reviewed by OFRO, if needed. All US and Mexico LoS and IFS public communications should be submitted into the newly replatformed OFRO Public Communications Review system, which will help determine whether your materials need further OFRO review. Please note: You may not have access to the OFRO Public Communication Review system initially. Reach out to the OFRO Public Comms CoE team to request access. 3. Reach out with questions. Visit our new Public Communications CoE page on the OFRO portal or connect with your Marketing or External Communications contact. You can also review the US Public Communications and Social Media Policy.

Preventing corruption is a responsibility we all share No one at PwC — regardless of role or level — can provide anything of value (e.g., gifts, entertainment, meals, travel, sponsorships, employment opportunities or other favors) to improperly influence a decision favorable to PwC, whether directly or through a third party. Remember third parties, such as contractors and suppliers, represent PwC and, as a result, cannot do what we ourselves would not do. Recognizing and preventing money laundering and terrorist financing The firm relies on all of us to confirm our clients’ identities by following the firm’s Engagement Acceptance and Continuance process, which involves screening potential clients and reviewing their ownership and operations. In addition to following firm procedures for client and engagement acceptance, what can you do? Be alert to red flags indicating a client may be engaging in money laundering: Secrecy or a lack of documentation about operations or business structures designed to hide ownership, such as the use of shell companies. Operations in countries and regions where terrorism, drug trafficking or other illegal activity is prevalent. Financial transactions that lack a legitimate business purpose or are designed to evade regulatory reporting requirements.

Better visibility throughout the process by using a workflow that enables enhanced connectivity between audit and non-audit teams. Improved search means you can find the right entity quickly. Creating an AFS just got easier — including the ability to clone for repeatable services and amend for service changes. Important AFS-related changes to keep in mind: A draft AFS will be automatically generated when your opportunity moves from the “Target” stage to the “Interact” or “Propose” stage in Salesforce. An AFS will not be automatically generated if you move your opportunity from ‘Target’ straight to “Close” or “Closed-Won.” You can always generate an AFS directly in the new tool. If you currently add “US AFS Review” as a secondary approver in AFS, this process has been simplified in the new tool. You’ll no longer have to add “US AFS Review” (previously known as “AFS SoSR team” or “TS Independence”) to your AFS. “Independence Specialist” will be added for you as the secondary approver on your AFS. If you’ve already initiated an AFS in the legacy system, you’ll still be able to access and progress your existing AFSs as usual in the legacy AFS system, but for new AFSs, you should use the new AFS tool. What support and resources are available? Explore our CES/AFS launch page on the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) portal to learn more, access training materials and read through FAQs you might have as you use these new tools. Questions?

This means it’s critical — for both you and the firm — to protect and properly use client information we’re entrusted with. Can you buy or sell securities based on inside information you come across at work? Can you share this information with family members or friends? The answer to both of these questions is “no.” Inside information is non-public information about a company (e.g., financial forecasts, merger and acquisition plans and key personnel changes) and includes all confidential client information. PwC and applicable laws prohibit: Buying or selling a company’s securities when you have inside information about that company, whether or not the company is a client. Sharing any inside information with anyone. It’s considered tipping and is also prohibited. Remember, even if you don’t have inside information, if you’re working with a client, you can’t trade — buy or sell — any of your client’s securities while working with that client and for a period of six months after you stop. Watch this short video on what not to do with inside information and review our Insider Trading Policy. If you have any questions, consult with your partner, the One Firm Risk Organization or Ethics &amp; Compliance via the Ethics HelpLine at 1-888-4-ETHICS.

The overview below provides further context around these key updates, which became effective June 28, 2019. For a comprehensive list of all USIP updates, with full details, visit the updated US Independence Policy page on the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) portal. Key updates include: The PCAOB issued FAQs on its Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, as described in this In Brief earlier this month. USIP has been updated to reflect the new guidance in these FAQs, including context around the audit committee communications that are required when there has been a violation of applicable auditor independence rules (see USIP 4130.11). The AICPA’s new independence interpretation on the provision of “hosting services” became effective on July 1. As a result, USIP has been updated to include new policies on what is permitted and prohibited relating to hosting an audit client’s data or records (i.e., “information”), whether financial or non-financial in nature (see USIP 7410.150). The GAO has revised its Yellow Book, resulting in updates to various areas of USIP, including expanded policies on what qualities indicate that management has the ability to effectively oversee a non-audit service to be provided to a GAO audit client (see USIP 7600.2) and revised policies regarding the provision of financial statement preparation services (see USIP 7610.2). USIP has been revised based on updated international independence standards and other network updates — among them, expanded policies on threats and safeguards analyses (see USIP 1310), Checkpoint considerations for cryptocurrencies (see USIP 3300.2), revised policies on employee search services (see USIP 7410.6), and revised policies on internal audit services (see USIP 7410.100). Learn more View the details of these and other revisions included in this update. To view the complete list of changes to USIP since the last update, see the Revision table or the redlined version of USIP. Still have questions? Visit the Independence section of the OFRO portal.

Initially planned to launch on July 1, we’re excited to announce that Gympass is available starting today so you can get started now and take full advantage of it during the July 4th break. Our new partnership with Gympass makes getting active even easier and helps fuel the physical dimension of Be well, work well, part of our Your Tomorrow strategy.

With access to more than 8,000 gyms and studios nationwide, you can find a fitness routine that works for you — whether you’re close to home, traveling for work or on vacation.

If your gym is added, Gympass will advise you. Gympass will work closely with your nominated facility; however, some facilities may not choose to opt into the Gympass network. Check out the FAQs for nomination details. Getting started US Partners and staff can begin using Gympass today — Mexico already enjoys the benefits of Gympass targeted to that market’s needs.

Using the program’s flexible and motivational framework, we engaged in behaviors that support Be well, work well and the dimensions of energy — physical, spiritual, emotional and mental, as well as financial. Together, we’ve surpassed our expectations for the program and accomplished a lot (to say the least): - We took an average of 130 million steps each day. - Almost 25% of participants averaged 7,000+ steps a day. - We created more than 40,000 healthy habit challenges. - Fifty percent of members achieved reward level 3 or 4 each quarter. - There were almost 41 million interactions with the Virgin Pulse platform.

You have until June 30 to sync your steps, and accumulate points and rewards for this quarter.* After June 30, your points reset to zero, but you’ll keep any PulseCash rewards you’ve banked. Many activities you may have completed this year will also reset on July 1, which means you’ll have more opportunities to earn rewards in the new fiscal year, including: - Preventive health exam ($50 PulseCash) - Dental screening (twice per year) - Vision exam - Nutritional counseling, weight management or stress management program (twice per year) - Well-being goals - MyPulse survey (your results from the previous year will clear out and refresh starting July 1) Don't forget to reset your interests for the new year!

Or did you fall for the hoax that your tax forms were rejected? Thankfully, it was just a drill to keep you on your toes for common tax scams that ensnare people every year. To steal valuable personal data, cyber criminals often focus on tax and other professionals. And their methods are not limited to email — be wary of phone calls (vishing) and text messages (SMiShing). As our tax pros will tell you, the Internal Revenue Service doesn’t initiate contact this way. Tips to easily identify email threats: Verify the sender: Cyber criminals use names of colleagues to appear trustworthy. If it’s suspicious, check with colleagues directly to confirm if they were the sender. Verify the sender’s email address: Hover your cursor over the sender’s name to see their email address, and check the domain to see if it’s legitimate (e.g., @pwc.com). Be cautious of unsolicited email: If you didn’t expect to be contacted by an organization (like your bank), exercise extra scrutiny. Verify the email is legitimate and compare it to the address of the sender. If you doubt the origin of the email, text, or phone call … report it! Don’t click hyperlinks in suspicious emails: You can preview a hyperlink’s web address by hovering your cursor over it (without clicking). Don’t open attachments you weren’t expecting or from someone you don’t know. Report suspicious emails in just a click! It’s up to you to help protect client, firm and personal data by reporting suspicious emails. Simply click the phish button on the Google sidebar or forward the message to GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com.

It’s true. What’s more, app stores aren’t required to describe what data is collected or to whom it’s disclosed. But what if you use your phone settings to limit contact or location sharing? Even so, the app can collect and share information not explicitly included in those settings. And even when app developers say they depersonalize data, it’s often assigned a unique identifier that can point to you. Sneaky. Follow these pointers to help protect yourself: Be cautious of any information you provide online. Assume that all data you enter into websites and apps can be shared, purchased or used for targeted marketing — even if you elected not to share location or contact info. Review the fine print. Read the terms of agreement and/or privacy notice to understand what information is collected and how it’s used.

Enhancements coming on Monday, Aug. 5 make Salesforce easier to use — and easier to capture the data that helps identify meaningful trends about our pursuits and client relationships. While these upgrades are being made, Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, Aug. 2 at 8 p.m. ET to Sunday, Aug. 4 at noon ET. Partners using our new Astro cognitive agent may also experience intermittent impact to your experience during the outage. Enriching data related to our pursuits 1. Contacts are now required on Opportunities in the ‘Propose’ stage. In line with our focus areas for FY20, understanding who the key contacts are on each of our pursuits will lead to an improved client experience and more targeted marketing efforts. Client contacts serve as buyers, coaches, influencers and stakeholders. Enter those contacts in the ‘Contact Role’ list on the opportunity page as soon as those interactions begin. 2. Multiple product codes can now be added during Detailed Opportunity creation. We know teaming across lines, verticals and groups can lead to multiple products being related to a single opportunity. This update allows you to add several product codes at once during Opportunity creation. Simplifying the Salesforce experience 1. Anyone on the Opportunity Team can unlock a Won opportunity. Opportunity Unlock is simpler than ever! Now anyone listed on the Opportunity team can unlock a win to make updates after closing. 2. Anyone on the Opportunity Team can unlock a Withdrawn opportunity. Feedback on unlocking wins has been positive, but we know opportunities could be withdrawn when they should still be open, or should have been correctly marked as a loss. The accuracy of our wins and losses will yield better insights. 3. Opportunity Leads can mark opportunities as Confidential. Opportunity Leads will join Opportunity Owners as users who have the ability to mark opportunities as confidential. As detailed in this July 22 PwC Inside article, we’ll be rolling out enhancements to the Central Entity Service and Authorisation for Services tools later this summer. Review the article and related OFRO site for considerations and next steps. Stay tuned to HQ for the latest in the coming weeks. Have feedback to share?

This deep dive into your feedback tells a great story about our strategy coming to life -- and your ideas on how we keep getting better. About 70% of us took part in the Global People Survey. Thanks to you, we have a very clear picture of what we do well and where we need to make more progress on our journey. You can take a closer look at our results below, but here are two points that got me really excited: the 19 point increase on developing digital skills and your feedback that you’re seeing more innovation in how we use technology to grow our business and use our talent to deliver for our clients. You also provided us with some excellent insights into where we should focus next. This includes helping our people make time for upskilling and continuing our efforts to make well-being central to our experience at PwC. What’s interesting to me is that these are areas we are already working on for FY20. These are also areas we can each influence through our personal choices and by working together in our teams to support each other -- whether that’s by protecting time to build our digital skills or making Be well, work well a priority. You’ll hear more about GPS in your lines and business units this summer as we take your feedback and turn it into action. And my one request for you is to talk with your relationship leader, coach and/or your teammates about where we’re headed and how we can help take our firm to the next step on our journey.

Hello FY20! Tim Ryan July 8, 2019 Team, Welcome back! I hope you had a great break -- it’s been fun to see the sharing on social media and I’m always amazed at the many different ways #PwCTakesABreak. Don’t forget to post your photo for a chance to win. I also want to say a huge thank you. Over 75% -- that's tens of thousands of you -- completed and earned your Digital Acumen knowledge badge. I could not be prouder! And what makes me even more excited is so many of you did this months ahead of the deadline so you could be a change agent at PwC. Team, thanks to all of you, we have the foundation to transform our business and our careers in even more exciting ways. Next up: we jump back in and use our new skills to digitize our business at scale -- team by team and engagement by engagement. Here’s what’s coming up for FY20: We’re going to make digitization our new business as usual. As we start each new project or engagement, we should make a plan for how we’ll execute Your Tomorrow to drive different outcomes. This includes leveraging upskilled people, the thousands of automations in Digital Lab, and tech-enabled approaches in each of our lines of service and coming from PwC Labs. Plus our upskilling journey will continue and we’ll soon be announcing our firmwide learning badge for FY20! We’ll continue to focus on making well-being central to Your Tomorrow. Taking a break after a busy year is one way we’re living our commitment. So is making Gympass available so we can work out near home or on the road. And so is having resources we can use when we need them -- like the Calm app or 24/7 emotional support through the Ginger app. One important way we can continue to raise our game is communicating and supporting each other. When we talk about well-being in our teams we can support each other in reaching our goals. We’ll keep a pulse on your experience at PwC through Feedback Fridays. This summer we’ll launch Feedback Fridays -- asking a question each week about different aspects of life at PwC. We hope you’ll be part of it because listening to your feedback is how we get new ideas and continue to make our firm better. And given how quickly we are moving, that’s more important than ever! We’ll put Astro to work to simplify and tech-enable our lives at PwC. As you might have heard from the partners you work with, Astro is our new cognitive agent. Astro will help us get things done by talking or texting from our phones. The partners are using it now and providing feedback to help us finetune Astro before we roll it out firmwide later this year. Team, everywhere I go I’m talking about the progress we’re making and the potential that lies ahead to do even more. Because of everything we’ve done in FY19, we’ve got the foundation we need to go even further and climb even higher. I hope you are rested up and ready to go -- I can’t wait to see what we accomplish this year!

You might notice that some PwCers and other people in your network are including their pronouns in their email signature. By doing so, they're sharing something that's important to them by letting you know how you can refer to them. We often make automatic assumptions about what pronouns to use for someone based on their appearance. Gender is made up of three components. Sex, which refers to an individual's biology and anatomy. Gender identity, which is their internal sense of being male, female or something else. And gender expression, which is an individual's appearance, dress or mannerisms that may be perceived as masculine or feminine. But sometimes a person’s gender identity doesn’t align with their gender expression. If a person chooses to tell you their pronouns (in their signature or otherwise), they are letting you know how you can refer to them, without you having to make assumptions. It’s their way of saying “when you refer to me using pronouns, these are the pronouns I’d like for you to use. This is who I am. This is me.” I'm sharing this so we can all be better colleagues to each other as we go about our work each day. Words can make someone feel like they belong or like they don’t fit in -- and we are striving to be a firm where everyone feels they belong.

Shannon Schuyler, Farhad Zaman and Wes Bricker will be joining the USLT, bringing new perspectives and experiences to the team. For those who are new to the firm, the USLT has management responsibility for our business and for driving our strategy with speed and agility. We work on behalf of all of you to make choices for our firm and to keep our business strong for the long term. Shannon, Farhad and Wes will immediately begin working with the rest of the team to drive and execute our strategy. The USLT is representative of the tremendous diversity and talent within our firm and brings many different skill sets, experiences and ways of thinking to the table. Wes will step into the role of Assurance Leader, succeeding Maria Moats. Maria has led the Assurance practice through a very important period of change and innovation. Wes will help us keep our momentum and build on all that has been done to enhance audit quality, advance innovation and run our business well. Wes is a former PwC Assurance partner. He left the firm and joined the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2015 and was named SEC Chief Accountant in 2016. Wes has resigned from his role at the SEC and is returning as an Assurance partner, based in the Washington D.C. area. Shannon will serve as Chief Purpose and Inclusion Officer with responsibility for both the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion and Responsible Business Leadership. Shannon is a proven leader committed to meaningful change and action that drives connectivity, engagement and pride in the work we do together. Shannon will bring unique insights and perspectives from her existing roles as Chief Purpose Officer and Responsible Business Leader to the Chief Diversity Officer role. As she transitions into this role, Shannon will work closely with Mike Dillon, who has championed the importance of diversity and inclusion as a business imperative for the past three years. Farhad will serve as Chief Network Officer for the US, succeeding Suneet Dua. Farhad was born in Bangladesh and grew up in seven countries on five continents before joining the firm. He has 26 years of extensive international experience serving many of our global Fortune 100 clients as a Deals partner and through overseas secondments with PwC Australia, India and UK. In his 14 years as a partner, Farhad’s roles have included National Office partner, human capital leader for CMAAS and the US Capital Markets leader. As Farhad moves into this role, Suneet will be refocusing his time on Your Tomorrow as a service offering for clients. Team, we’re fortunate to be part of a firm that provides us with so many opportunities for growth and success. I know you will join me in congratulating and supporting all those taking on new responsibilities.

In my experience, our clients are hungry to hear our views on what’s happening in business. Of course, we don’t share confidential information. But as we do work for multiple clients, we have insights to share. What I do several times a year is reflect on the themes coming out of my conversations with CEOs and share these with my contact list of CEOs and others to give them insight into what other leaders are collectively focused on. I just sent my latest note to more than 1,000 business leaders. I also share this with our partners, and with all of you, to help you with your own client conversations. Please see my note below -- I hope you’ll find this helpful! And if you want to share with your clients, I’ve also posted my observations on LinkedIn. CEO Insights - July 2019 The best part of my job is getting to speak to CEOs and business leaders from a variety of sectors, industries and countries. Through our conversations, I’m able to get a good sense of CEO sentiment as well as identify the macro trends impacting all types of businesses and industries. Overall, I believe CEO sentiment is positive. But when you drill down, that positive outlook is pointed at the things that executives can control. On the things that can’t be controlled -- the economy, trade, regulation, etc. -- the outlook isn’t as optimistic. With that said, businesses aren’t standing still. If business executives have demonstrated anything over the last few years, it is that worrying about what you can’t control is not productive and energy is best focused on the things that can be controlled. As a result, most executives would classify the environment as “glass is half full.” Here are five key business trends that CEOs should keep in mind as they focus on what they can control: 1. Despite market uncertainty, organic growth goals remain high Even though CEOs can clearly see the economic headwinds that are on the horizon -- with growing trade tensions and market uncertainty -- most of the ones I’ve spoken with remain optimistic about their own companies’ growth potential. In fact, many have very aggressive organic growth targets despite knowing that supply in many cases is outstripping demand and that competition has become more cutthroat than ever. CEOs are realistic and know they’re going to have to fight for market share. And with 91% of US CEOs confident that their companies will grow organically in the next 12 months (according to the most recent PwC CEO Survey), we’ll likely see more battles for market share, where companies with the lowest cost and best value will win. As a result, CEOs and C-Suite leaders are laser-focused on improving the cost of their products and services, increasing their value proposition and improving their customer experience. This will be especially important if the economy turns and companies may no longer have the pricing power they once had. 2. Be nimble and move quickly: To win market share, CEOs must lead change efforts with intensity and urgency There is a wide range in intensity when it comes to how different companies and their respective leaders are responding to this more challenging business environment. Some companies are quickly adapting and changing, while others are moving much slower than expected. But the common trait among those companies moving quickly is the engagement and focus of the CEO. As one CEO said to me recently, “Let’s face it -- what people really want to do is get to their office and simply do their work the same way they did it yesterday.” This insight perfectly illustrates how behavior gets entrenched and how change often has to be driven from the top down. Indeed, CEOs need to be a “force of nature” in shifting the organizational and cultural behaviors responsible for preventing change from taking hold. I personally believe that this is a big opportunity for CEOs. They can take charge and be even more forceful in driving change within and across their company. This is especially true in a tougher economic climate, where greater reward will go to the CEOs and companies that achieve better execution versus the ones that just design the perfect strategy. Speed is the name of the game. As leaders, CEOs need to not only drive change with intensity, but also do it fast. The world is only going to continue to throw us curveballs, whether they be tariffs and trade conflicts, regulatory uncertainty, or market volatility. The key to overcoming these challenges is to build your organization’s ability to be nimble and to adapt quickly. 3. Are you getting the right return for your IT and technology spend? We are seeing a continued high level of spending on IT and emerging technology at most companies. New CRM, human capital and finance systems along with AI and data analytic platforms provide great promise of efficiencies, quicker data for making better and faster business decisions, more collaboration to better serve customers, and increased employee productivity. But unfortunately in many cases these aspirations are not being fully realized. Why? Many companies are implementing large-scale technology solutions but underestimating the behavioral and cultural changes that need to be managed with new technology. What do I mean? One CEO said to me that they invested in a new CRM system but underestimated the desire of middle and line personnel to simply do work the way they always did (meaning they did not embrace the new technology, but rather simply continued to use their legacy practices, spreadsheets and communications). The CEO surmised “we bought and paid for world class technology, but didn’t show our people how to work and manage differently” and therefore, “we didn’t achieve the benefits and ROI that was expected.” Major IT projects need active involvement by the C-Suite as well as the right amount of time invested in the change management around the system or technology being implemented. 4. Invest in “citizen-led” innovation and change We are seeing some companies invest in digital upskilling and teaching their employees, by the thousands, new skills such as data wrangling, data visualization, bot building and data automation, to name a few. What companies are discovering is that by teaching their employees in sales, finance, accounting, human capital and the back office these new skills, the workforce can then apply those skills to automating and reimagining their day-to-day work tasks. This can help create capacity for growth without adding headcount. Based on what we have seen from our own experiences, we are of the view that there are billions of dollars of cost savings to be achieved in corporate America if employees are given new skills. Similarly, we have seen that teaching these skills to large percentages of the entire employee base builds loyalty and can serve both to help attract and retain talent in what is only going to be a continuing tight labor market. 5. Investors are closely watching management’s ability to execute Most importantly, the investor community sees all the challenges and opportunities that companies and CEOs are facing -- and they’re making their investment decisions accordingly. While some companies will survive and thrive, others companies that are not able to remain competitive will become targets of activist investors and M&amp;A. And, of course, a major root cause of not being able to stay competitive is the effectiveness and speed of change that CEOs are responsible for leading. Investors are looking to invest in companies where the CEOs have the skills to lead change and transformation. They are looking closely at the quality and speed with which company management is transforming the business. One major investor shared with me that he is not looking to invest in companies with management teams that have the highest external profiles. Instead, he is looking to invest in companies with CEOs who are focused on the guts of the business because that is what matters. Companies that are going to be rewarded by investors are the ones that have CEOs and management teams who roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty in the change and transformation agenda.

What does the Salesforce-Tableau transaction mean to me? HQ News June 17, 2019 Last week Salesforce announced plans to acquire Tableau. As you may know, Tableau is an SEC-restricted audit client of PwC. Many of us use the Tableau tool in our work and may also be hearing discussions and reactions in the marketplace. Here are a few questions and answers to keep in mind. Will we continue to use Tableau in our work? Yes. We don’t expect any changes and we should continue to use Tableau for firm and client projects. Does this mean Tableau is no longer an SEC-restricted client? No. Tableau continues to be subject to SEC independence restrictions; those restrictions will remain in place through at least the actual closing date of the transaction. What if I’m involved with strategy or implementation for Salesforce proposals or projects for our non-audit clients? Should I be doing anything differently? It’s premature to focus on this given the transaction has not closed. We should continue with business as usual, which includes avoiding the promotion or endorsement of restricted entities such as Tableau. In light of this transaction, should I change how I talk to my client about using Tableau tools? Tableau is still an audit client and subject to independence requirements. Under independence rules we must avoid promoting or endorsing restricted entities such as Tableau. What if I have a question? At PwC, you never have to go it alone. When in doubt, please consult with our colleagues in the One Firm Risk Organization - Independence Office. We also have guidance on permitted activities when interacting with SEC-restricted software providers.

With our combined strength and resources, we’re bringing greater value to our clients and creating opportunities for our people. Teaming to deliver value to our clients. One of these cross-border success stories comes from our International Tax Qualitative Solutions team. Tax partners Lissett Tautfest, in Mexico City, and Justin Denworth and Darryl Wodecki in the US worked together to develop staff in Mexico to perform quantitative modeling to support our clients. By expanding the ITS-QS team into Mexico City, we were able to improve margins on the work we deliver to our clients, as well as respond to the increased client demand for quantitative modeling as a result of US tax reform. Lissett says, “Our staff in Mexico has shown agility, drive and an ability to work remotely with teams across the US, while learning both new technology and US tax technical skills. It’s a testament to what our people can do when presented with innovative and unfamiliar challenges.” Delivering deep local knowledge. Our strong presence in both the US and Mexico has been a differentiator when proposing to clients who do business across borders. For example, our firm now serves as auditors of Kansas City Southern Railway -- a transportation company with railway routes across the US and Mexico. According to engagement partner Christopher Briggs, our presence in both countries was one of the key reasons that Kansas City Southern chose to work with PwC. And earlier this year, we were chosen as global mobility providers for CEMEX, one of the largest companies in Mexico. The decision makers at CEMEX cited our track record in the broader tax area -- and our ability to field strong local teams in Mexico, the US and more broadly. Led by Tom Richards, with support from Alice Espinoza, the team includes PwC professionals from PwC Mexico, US, UK and Colombia. Opportunities for our people. The sharing of talent flows both ways between the US and Mexico. In the past year, we have had 75 international assignments between Mexico and the US, as well as many teams working together as we serve clients. The US and Mexico are also on a shared upskilling journey, using workflow and data visualization tools, as well as both building and using tools from the Digital Lab. As a result of upskilling, our teams in both the US and Mexico are using digital tools to add value for our clients. For example, the Advisory Finance practice in Mexico has been using Robotic Processing Automations to drive digital transformation by finding innovative ways to reduce costs, enhance quality and improve processing times for our clients in retail, health, telecommunications, financial and shared services. The Mexico Advisory Finance Practice has also teamed with the US and Acceleration Centers on projects for non-audit clients Ingredion and Pepsi. As we mark the third anniversary, we celebrate these and many other successes that come with serving clients together, sharing talent and bringing clients the benefits of deep knowledge and professional relationships on both sides of the border.

With the help of a few CEOs, we founded a coalition called CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™. As we mark the second anniversary of CEO Action next week, I want to thank you. One of the reasons the CEO Action coalition continues to grow is because we’re talking with our clients, sharing our experiences and and asking them to join us. As the coalition grows, so does our impact. By standing together and sharing what we’ve learned, we’re not only driving change within our individual organizations but across the business community. As we talk to our clients and others, we can be proud to share what CEO Action has accomplished: CEO Action has grown to nearly 700 CEOs representing more than 14 million employees. Last December, the coalition engaged more than 615,000 employees of CEO Action signatories from around the world in conversations about bias and understanding in the workplace. CEO Action is leading an immersive, tech-enabled nationwide unconscious bias awareness tour that has already reached tens of thousands. And we can share the next steps we’re taking: Inside PwC: To mark the second anniversary, all CEO Action signatories have been invited to take action together, by holding open and honest conversations. Here at PwC, we’ve been holding our inclusive leadership training for 20,000 seniors and associates, so they can lead on these issues from the start of their PwC careers. With our clients: We can talk with our clients about a new CEO Action pledge to create and share strategic inclusion and diversity plans with their board of directors (or equivalent governing body). Given their shared responsibility for driving strategies that help companies thrive, boards and CEOs together play a critical role in cultivating strong, inclusive cultures and talent. This new commitment will help leaders drive accountability around D&amp;I strategies -- and for CEO Action to drive change across the business community. To help you prepare to talk with your clients, here’s an overview of what we are communicating this week. We’re truly an organization that leads with its purpose and values. When people ask me what that means, I’m proud to tell them about our role in leading the business community to do better on one of the most important issues of our time.

Responsible Business Leadership Aug. 20, 2019 Why mentor? It is back-to-school time across the country, and you can help get students excited about learning and prepared to lead in the jobs of tomorrow. Children in high-poverty environments struggle not only with basic needs, but also with losing precious time to continue their learning. The cumulative effect is a crisis in the making: By the fifth grade, summer learning loss can leave low-income students almost three years behind their more affluent peers. Mentor students and earn dollars for your favorite charity -- Win, win! The good news: Guidance from a trusted ally who can provide insight on everything from education to career options can make all the difference for many young people. In fact, students with a mentor are 55% more likely to be enrolled in college than those who did not have a mentor, according to mentoring.org. Plus, for each 25 hours of time charged to our volunteer WBS codes, you’ll automatically receive a $375 Dollars for Doers credit in our giving site to use for the nonprofit of your choice (up to $1,500/year). Remember to charge ALL your mentoring time to 80071199001; whether through PwC or outside the firm, on weekdays or weekends! How can I get started mentoring? Get involved with Access Your Potential, our firm’s commitment to bring tech, financial and career skills to students and teachers to help address the opportunity gap.

These actions make an impact in our communities and deliver business value by creating a more equitable society. You can support the firm’s Responsible Business Leadership strategy in many ways — through volunteer opportunities, donations, Green Teams and more. Still not sure how you can make a difference when it comes to the environment? Here are a few tips to help get you started: Get active — This is the simplest thing that all of us can do. Walk that short distance or ride a bike. It will help cut down on the automobile emissions and improve your physical energy, which is part of our commitment to Be well, work well. Save water —Support water conservation by using low intensity showers and switching off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving -- these are easy things to incorporate into our daily lives that ultimately make a big difference. Reduce, reuse and recycle — Say no to plastic grocery bags and straws, use coffee mugs, reuse shopping bags and glass water bottles -- and consider where else you can make these small changes. Join a local PwC Green Team, which helps focus on waste reduction and improving recycling in our offices. Stay cool without AC — Keep cool by opening windows and use hot appliances sparingly at night or in the early morning so your air conditioner doesn’t have to fight as hard to produce energy. And as a bonus, save money on your electric bill! Ride Together — By taking public transportation or carpooling to your destination instead of hopping in the car alone, you reduce your carbon footprint and get a chance to strengthen personal and professional relationships with fellow travelers. Use 'Ride Together', the firm’s rideshare app, to help find a travel buddy to and from the office, a client site or wherever you need to be.

Fifteen teams of PwCers from around the world will represent their home countries, including the US, Germany, Italy, China, Croatia, Slovakia and Poland. Team USA is looking to win back the championship title after a third place finish last year with a narrow loss to Serbia in the semi-finals. Team USA is made up of 13 self-nominated men and women with basketball experience from across the firm. They’ll practice together for the first time in Ljubljana on July 2 — just two days before the tournament. For the past few months, the team has prepped virtually with conference calls to get to know each other, exchange training tips and share strategies. The tournament is much more than just an athletic event. It began in 2008 as a way for PwC member firms throughout the world to network and connect with each other. The tradition continues, providing the opportunity for colleagues to develop their global acumen and live our values — showing that they care about the sport, the firm and each other. Stay tuned for the tournament results later next month. We wish all participants the best of luck! Interested in playing in the 2020 tournament?

The event focused on issues that affect the LGBT+ community, including how all of us at PwC play a role in building a sense of belonging for our colleagues. Here’s Kendall Toarmina’s first-hand experience at the summit and how being a woman, being queer and being a dedicated PwCer all came together to shape her participation. Kendall is a senior associate in Advisory, People and Organization and is involved in Shine. Outside of work she leads Rice University’s LGBT+ alumni association. She lives in Houston with her wife and their dogs. For our family, June is the most fabulous time of the year: Pride Month. This year was extra special with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, representing the LGBT+ community’s resilience, persistence and joyful inclusion. I was honored to be selected to attend PwC’s Global LGBT+ Summit and participate in World Pride. More than 160 PwC Shine members from the US and around the globe descended on New York City and came together as a global network to discuss issues that affect LGBT+ people in workplaces around the world, culminating in marching in World Pride. Our discussions were far-ranging and impactful. We talked about intersectionality — and how the different aspects of who we are overlap and interconnect and how that impacts our experiences in the firm and in the world. For me, being a queer woman is a big part of who I am. I’m also a consultant, an MBA and an advocate for social justice. Learning more about the identities and intersectional dimensions of my colleagues from across the firm helped me better understand them and build connections. We also heard some amazing speakers: Todd Sears from Out Leadership; Anna Brown, CEO and chair of Equality Australia; Kate Wicketts, vice-chair of Sydney Mardi Gras; Ricardo Goncalves, journalist with SBS; Josh Howard, director of The Lavender Scare; and Joanne Rogers, PwC leadership and organizational development consultant in the UK. Joanne’s session, Genius. Power. Dreams, was inspiring and something I’m certain will stay with me for years to come. The Summit: Connecting across the globe As I prepared to participate with PwC in the World Pride March in New York City, I did the only thing a seasoned pride marcher would do: I ordered as much rainbow glitter as TSA would allow me to carry! I packed my bags and my #glitterlife, and brought my wife and my whole self to New York City. One of the biggest highlights of the Summit was talking with PwCers from all over — Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oregon, as well as Turkey, Poland, Japan, China, England, Spain, Switzerland and South Africa — as they shared their stories and experiences. In total, more than 25 countries were represented. To me, LGBT+ pride is about radically accepting oneself. It’s about taking this part of one’s identity — being LGBT+ — that has historically often been a source of shame, and turning that shame completely upside down. It’s about saying, “Not only am I not ashamed to be who I am, I have pride in who I am.” For all of us, LGBT+ pride is about creating a culture where each of us can feel proud of who we are at work. I heard that from Assurance Partner Mike Dillon, “Early on, someone told me, ‘Just be yourself every day here,’ and I vowed to pass that forward.” And I also heard it from Bob Moritz, global chairman and long-time LGBT+ ally, “You can never have your best day or your best impact if you can’t be yourself.” What more can we do? Despite all our progress, Bob Moritz’s words during the summit rang true, “What we have done so far is great, but we’re humble enough to know that it’s not enough.” I asked other participants how we can all be allies to the LGBT+ community. Here’s what I heard: Learn about Shine and attend LGBT+ events in your local office. It goes a long way to show you care. Educate yourself about gender identity and expression. If you have a chance to help someone during or after a gender transition, lean into that and be there for them. More resources here. Use gender neutral language. For example, if a colleague mentions being married, don’t assume their spouse is a different gender by saying something like “What does she do?” A man might have a husband, and a woman might have a wife. Know that everyone’s experience as an LGBT+ person is different. If you have any questions, just ask! We want to share and help you understand. Coming together for WorldPride On the last day of the summit, our group met up at PwC’s Manhattan office to get ready for the WorldPride march. My wife and I sat down at a table and touched up our glittered faces. I offered to do a glitter rainbow on a friend’s arm, and soon, a line for glitter rainbows had formed at my little table! I loved seeing the looks on their faces as we brought their inner shine to the surface. WorldPride was the glitter beacon for the rest of the world to have a reason to join one another in struggle and in celebration. Pride Month in June is great, but it doesn’t have to be the only month in which we embody inclusion, joy and love for those around us, whether they are similar to us or not. It’s been almost three weeks, and I’m still finding glitter in my house. Truth be told, I wouldn’t have it any other way.

We’re committed to creating a culture where we can take care of ourselves and manage our energy. For inspiration, here’s what a few of our winners have been up to: Max Ikrom: As my engagement team's resident Be well, work well champion, I’m always pushing the team to work out when we're onsite at the client. This summer, we incorporated kickboxing into our workouts. To hype up the team, we took a hike in Hollywood Lake Park, Calif. to take a picture by the Hollywood sign. I take pride in the role I play to promote well-being amongst my teammates and being part of a firm that cares about its peoples’ well-being! Zebrina Stofiel: My daughter, Bella, is interested in marine biology. During our trip to Orlando, Fla., I made time for us to spend the day as aquatic animal trainers at Discovery Cove. We worked with a lot of different animals, swam with dolphins and went behind the scenes to learn about meal prep, cleanup and scheduling. The facility was amazing and furthered my daughter's enthusiasm for this subject even more! Thank you PwC! I could not have introduced my daughter to this experience without the support of my team and the firm's encouragement of work/life balance. Jeff Dietrich: My wife is an elementary school nurse, so with classes starting back up this week, we decided to head down the Pacific coast for a quick, recharging getaway. The views up and down the coast were amazing. I thought it would be fun to commemorate this moment while we were at the Dana Point Headlands Conservation area near Laguna Beach, Calif. Francoise Mugano: While traveling through Europe, I could not pass up the chance to visit Dubrovnik, Croatia. The city served as the filming location for the fictional fortified port city of King’s Landing in Game of Thrones (GOT). Being a big fan of the show, a highlight of the trip was not only walking around King’s Landing and the city of Qarth, but also sitting on the iron throne. I felt like I was in the middle of a GOT amusement park. I’m so grateful to be able to take this time off to reconnect with loved ones and myself! Haley Hosea: My uncle and I share a love for travel. Since we live in different states, we plan trips together. Our recent adventure took us from Santiago, Chile to the Patagonia region where we hiked in Torres del Paine National Park. We ended our trip in Argentina by exploring the Perito Moreno Glacier. Glacier trekking was a unique experience — this was definitely an incredible trip! Shelly Switick: Recently, I traveled abroad for a much-needed #pwctakesabreak to Iceland, Scotland and England. While in England, my best friend and I traveled to Teesdale Alpacas Farm at Barnard Castle because we're huge llama and alpaca fans. There we met a handsome alpaca named Dougal — he graciously agreed to take a selfie with us! Nate Gaudinez: I capped off my two-week trip in Asia visiting family in the Philippines by spending three days in Tokyo, Japan. While only a short portion of my trip, it was an amazing experience touring the various districts of Tokyo and immersing myself in Japanese culture. Visiting Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea was the cherry on top of an overall great trip! Remember, success is a team sport at PwC — and that includes being successful at unplugging and getting away. To help you do this, plan for vacation ahead of time and set your email “out of office” message, so your time away is protected. *Per the contest guidelines, prize eligibility is for active US employees only.

For habit refresher team KINDa_Contagious, it helped them earn one of four $10,000 grand prize spots and brought our purpose-led, values-driven culture to life. The 16-person Southeast Market team boosted their emotional well-being by spreading kindness in their local communities. “We were motivated to honor the memory of Bo Jean,” team lead Amy Valenti said. “Bo was actively involved in his community and gave back. That’s why we committed to daily intentional acts of kindness for the habit refresher.” The team logged numerous acts of kindness throughout the challenge, including making bags filled with food and toiletries for homeless people in Tampa. While the habit refresher may be over, Team KINDa_Contagious is still going strong. “We learned that kindness truly fuels emotional well-being, and witnessed firsthand a reduction in stress, anxiety and negative emotions,” said Amy. “That’s why we decided to keep the kindness going by using all of our prize money to supply hundreds of children with backpacks and supplies for the new school year.” Every backpack will include a note in memory of Bo and a reminder that kindness is contagious — encouraging parents and children to pay it forward by directing them to PwC’s share kindness site. Each team member is selecting an organization or school in their community through which to distribute the backpacks. The team also launched crowdfunding pages on Impact Space to increase support to select charities. To date, they’ve raised an additional $3,000. “Acts of kindness create a ripple effect of positivity,” team member Amber Papadopoulos said. “We want to turn that ripple into a tidal wave.” If you’d like to contribute to their cause, please click here.

Winners will receive the AmEx gift card via mail to their home address within two to three weeks. You can view a full listing of all the winners here. Here’s what some of our winners have done over the summer: Niladari Dutta: 11 days, 2240 miles, 5 states, 6 National Parks, 45F to 109F degree weather, landscapes ranging from the Moab desert to the peaks of the Rocky Mountains, amazing flora, charging bison &amp; mousse, and obviously great food - this is how I would summarize my #pwctakesabreak with my friends. Originally, visiting the Rocky Mountains was not on the agenda. But after 10 days of extensive road tripping, we decided not to let our proximity to the mountains pass us by, so we closed out our trip at Estes National Park and Rocky Mountains National Park – driving through the highest motorable road in the United States – the Trail Ridge road. Daniel Garcia: This summer has been full of fun and adventure! We traveled to Italy and enjoyed several long beach weekends all over the East Coast. This pic is from Amagansett in New York state. It has become an annual destination for the Garcia family. Even during the busiest of summer weekends, we can still find tranquility and relaxation here...plus we've become addicted to the local saltwater taffy! Nicole Wong: My in-laws organized a three-generation, 135+ person, North American family reunion in Toronto, Canada. Luckily our epic family gathering coincided perfectly with our #pwctakesabreak July 4th shutdown! This trip marked lots of momentous firsts for our family: my in-laws taking a photo with all nine grandchildren, my toddler using his American passport and me seeing my animal-loving toddler experience walking on the ocean floor as we traveled through the Toronto aquarium's tunnel. I'm especially thankful I was able to be 100% present during that time exploring with my son! Nicole Dunn: I took a long weekend to attend a family reunion in Laguna Beach, CA. It was great to see everyone again, catch up and eat tons of delicious food. My favorite part of the weekend was reliving all our old family traditions, like making s'mores and visiting the local bookstore to pick up a beach read. Carmen Nieves: On the way to dinner in Orlando, FL, we saw some helicopters giving rides and decided to make a detour. I am afraid of heights, but my family convinced me to take the risk. The helicopter took us around parts of the city and was even able to get close to Downtown Disney. I was amazed by all the beautiful places found in this state. In the end, I felt a sense of accomplishment because I took this risk, overcame my fear of heights and was able to enjoy this new adventure with my family! Sabrina Janski: I spent the past few days in Zion National Park with a few friends. We did several hikes within the area, including the Narrows and Angels Landing. Zion Canyon is absolutely beautiful and I was so glad to be able to experience it! Summer may be nearly over, but it’s never too early to plan ahead for some serious energy renewal and book your next vacation. Here are a few tips to help you jumpstart your planning in order to get the most from your time away. Take all your vacation days: Don’t let your time accrue until it maxes out. And don’t tell yourself you don’t have the time to spare. You’ll feel more energized and mentally focused to deliver your best during longer busier periods if you plan for and take vacation days sprinkled here and there. You can easily check your available time on the Me@PwC app (you can download it from PwC’s App Store). Make your plans now: Schedule your intermittent vacation days and longer vacation plans in advance so you can prepare your team for the time off. Planning ahead gives you something to look forward to, and working together as a team makes it happen for you and helps your teammates get ready. Unplug &amp; unwind: Remember that time off should be work-free. If you don’t disengage when you’re on vacation, you’ll miss the value of taking one. When you schedule your vacation ahead of time and work with your team to prepare, it should be easy to disconnect. That means no email, no calls, no calendar invites. It’s important to take time off without interruptions. Lead by example: Taking a vacation will encourage your team members to do the same. As a firm, we truly value the ability to take time off to disconnect. When you lead by example — you demonstrate your commitment to well-being and show your teammates that they should prioritize theirs as well. As you plan your next vacation, remember why breaks exist: to fully recharge, physically and mentally. Uninterrupted relaxation time benefits us, our teams and the firm — so we can all work better together. Contact: Be well, work well team Quick read Don’t forget to post your summer vacation photos on social media using #pwctakesabreak. Our next #pwctakesabreak drawing for $150 will be announced Sept. 10.

Our #pwctakesabreak July 4 shutdown is almost here! People Team June 28, 2019 The July 4th firmwide shutdown is just one example of how we’re committed to creating a culture where we can take care of ourselves and manage our energy.

From now until September 6, share your photos on Twitter and Instagram using #pwctakesabreak for a chance to win $150. Please see the contest guidelines and our social media policy for more details. In order to be included in the three random drawings taking place this summer, you must include your first and last name on your profile. Drawing 1 — July 16, post by 11:59 PM EST on Friday, July 12 Drawing 2 — Aug 13, post by 11:59 PM EST on Friday, August 9 Drawing 3 — Sept 10, post by 11:59 PM EST on Friday, Sept. 6 For some inspiration, here are a few of your colleagues’ Be well, work well plans for the shutdown: Remember, success is a team sport at PwC — and that includes being successful at unplugging and getting away. To help you do this, we recommend setting your email “out of office” message so your time away is protected. If you need to send an email during the shutdown, consider scheduling your message so it’s delivered when is best for both your clients and colleagues. Tips to help you get the most from your break and come back totally refreshed: Unplug from the screen: Stop yourself from checking email, social media and voicemail. Get your zzz’s: Sleep is key for well-being, so make sure you get enough during the time off. Try something new: Whether it’s salsa dancing or paddle boarding, do something different. Enjoy yourself: Do something you know will make you happy. You’ll bring that happy feeling back with you. Have a safe and fun summer break! Note: There will be some cases where individuals will need to work over the shutdown to meet client demands. Team leaders or partners will work with these individuals to help them take time away prior to or immediately after the break.

Whether you’re taking an exotic trip, relaxing at home or giving back in your community, let us know how you’re managing energy this summer. Eileen O’Neil: With the firm’s generous week off, I chose to volunteer my time in Costa Rica to help conservation efforts on the Osa Peninsula. The project included surveying various species of birds, primates, reptiles and bats in the jungle as well as protecting and monitoring sea turtle nesting activity along the beach. I was grateful for the opportunity to be informed, challenged and inspired while experiencing a new culture. Colin Gerner and Justin Hopton: We travelled to Beijing and Shanghai for the #pwctakesabreak July 4th shutdown. It was great to take in the many sights and unique experiences of China. The highlight of our trip was a private tour of the Great Wall of China, which concluded with singing karaoke with the local residents. We made many new friends on the trip and can’t wait to go back! Sona Tawney: For the first time in over 10 years, we went on a family vacation. We had a lot to celebrate — my parents’ 60th birthdays and my first wedding anniversary. My parents had never visited Mexico or experienced an all-inclusive vacation, so we surprised them with one to Cancun. It was so wonderful to spend quality time with the entire family and make memories that will be cherished forever. Thank you, PwC! Devon Van Buren: As a military family (my husband is on active duty in the Army), we relocated from Florida to New York City. Following the move, our entire family needed some rest and relaxation. The break was a perfect opportunity for us to take a road trip to see a bucket list item, Niagara Falls, Ontario. It was great to share this invaluable experience with my family during this time of transition. Mohana Beeregowda: Trekking has always been my favorite outdoor activity. With the week off, I decided to venture on my biggest trek ever — Everest base camp. I trained for many years to prepare for this particular trek. Reaching Everest base camp is a dream come true. Thanks for the time, PwC! Veon Watson: Prince charming (my husband Sean) and I got married in a magical ceremony! We are both huge fans of Disney and often spend our PwC breaks there. The reception was held inside the Epcot theme park and in classic Disney style the elaborate wedding was planned in one day! Wedding planners and experts were brought in from all areas and the rest was history. We truly felt like guests at our own wedding. Dan Choi: Surfing has been a lifelong passion of mine. For #pwctakesabreak, I unplugged from work and re-energized by surfing in Fiji. Cloudbreak is one of the world’s best places to catch a wave. Bula! Derek Hertges: I spent the firm shutdown on an annual hiking trip in Colorado with two friends from college. We traveled the state, camping every night and hiking every day. This year we tackled Manitou Incline and two mountains over 14,000 feet tall (Mount Harvard and Quandary Peak)!

Every year, our Talent Acquisition team helps us bring nearly 10,000 new interns and entry-level PwCers into the firm. We’re getting ready to launch exciting enhancements to entry-level hiring — a great example of how PwC is leading the way through Your Tomorrow to simplify and improve processes. Starting this fall, we’ll streamline the application and interview process by: Implementing national application deadlines for all entry-level hires, rather than following the dates set by schools that span over eight weeks. Leveraging technology to provide greater flexibility for candidates and interviewers by conducting all interviews virtually. These changes will reduce offer times for most applicants and improve their overall experience. Our recruiters will have more time to spend with the candidates we want to hire and we’ll have greater visibility into the full talent pipeline. Watch this video to see how the new process works.

Rankings are based on surveys representing over 4.5 million employees’ experiences of how their workplaces have made a difference in their lives and in their communities. Rankings also reflect Great Place to Work's assessment of the generosity of each organization's benefits, philanthropic and community support, with particular focus on activities occurring in the last year. Our continued investment on diversity and inclusion, well-being and Responsible Business Leadership, and Digital Upskilling through Your Tomorrow — reinforced by our purpose and values — underscores our commitment to create a place where everyone is supported and encouraged to become the best version of themselves. Through the survey responses, here’s what was heard: We offer generous benefits and wellness perks. We provide generous leave policies and an innovative phased return-to-work program. We offer an unprescribed number of sick days for eligible staff, to take time off for their own illness or injury. We support our people in times of need. The PwC Charitable Foundation, Inc. makes contributions to our people and their immediate families in times of unexpected financial hardship. It also helps fund charitable organizations where our people volunteer. We listen and build trust. We’ve held hundreds of Inclusive Leadership and Belonging sessions. They are helping us learn what we can do to make the experience for every person at PwC even better. We continue to lead the way on this and are doing our part as individuals and a firm through the CEO Action “I Act On” pledge to personally commit to support inclusion and driving action at PwC and in our communities. We make flexibility and well-being work … every day. We know that flexibility is good for both our people and our business. Our people have the flexibility they need where, when and how they work. And we’re committed to a focus on well-being through Be well, work well, as part of our caring culture. Volunteerism is at the heart of our giving culture. As part of our Responsible Business Leadership strategy, we encourage our people to volunteer for activities that are important to them. We couldn’t have earned this recognition without building an exceptional culture together — one that inspires all of us to deliver our best. We’re excited to see our contributions have an impact, and that we’re making a difference for our clients, our communities and one another.

What’s next? In FY20, we’ll continue our momentum to digitize PwC through Your Tomorrow with new and enhanced upskilling content, programs and tools. First up: Enhanced Digital Hub We’re starting the year by launching a streamlined Digital Hub. Learning on the go? Experience the refreshed design of the Digital Hub app from your mobile device. Desktop users can access it here. And remember, if you’re not on PwC office wifi, make sure to launch VPN when accessing internal links (and apps if you’re an Android user) from your phone. The sleek, modern design will immerse you in digital learning from the first click or tap. New features include a digital channels carousel and a list of recommended learning assets. Plus, you can access the Digital Lab on the dial pad in the top navigation bar and register for a Digital Academy session right from the Digital Academy page (several sessions have July openings!). Announcing our next class of Digital Accelerators Congrats to our second class of DAs who are ready to “rock it” in orbit! We had thousands of self nominees and we’re excited to announce the next crew. Check out the Digital Accelerator crew roster Class 2 will begin their Digital Accelerator missions at one of two Liftoff onboarding sessions in August 2019 or January 2020, after which they’ll continue their learning while applying their new digital knowledge and skills to their assignments on the ground. We notified those who self nominated in Advisory, Assurance and IFS of their selection outcomes last week. (Tax applicants will be notified in September in line with the timing of other Tax staff redeployments.) Stay tuned for more details about where we’re headed in FY20. And congratulations to our second class of Digital Accelerators — good luck to all of you on your digital missions!

Digital Café hours, locations and access details will be shared in PwC Inside later this week. Expanded Personal Trainers program: Later this month, more peer-to-peer learning will be available. The opportunity to be Personal Trainers, one-on-one mentors who give their digital skills a workout, will open to anyone firmwide. Directors and managing directors will be able to request Personal Trainers. And to make things easier, Personal Trainer/trainee matching will now occur right in the Digital Hub. Virtual Digital Academy: Over 25,000 of us have attended an in-person Digital Academy — but we know there is continued demand, and many want a refresher. In January, we’ll offer a Virtual Digital Academy, six to eight hours of online data analysis, visualization and automation learning in a fun “escape-the-room” format. The six virtual Digital Academy modules can be completed in any order so you can brush up on skills you’ve already built or start fresh. Note: The two-day in-person Digital Academy will sunset at the end of this calendar year. Did you PowerUp! last Friday? PowerUp!, our live trivia sensation, is back and will run in three, four-to-five game sprints — one game a week at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesdays — through FY20. Win cash while upskilling! The rest of this sprint’s games will take place on Nov. 5 (today!), 12 and 19. New this year, winners will have the option to donate their prize money to charity and, to keep things interesting, the prize money for each game will differ. Join the fun by downloading the PowerUp! app from PwC’s App Store, setting up your profile and preparing for games in the Digital Hub. The next PowerUp! sprint will happen in February 2020. Much more on each of our new and enhanced learning channels will be coming soon, so stay tuned to PwC Inside and HQ.

It’s very similar to the current US version, with a few minor differences that will bring us in alignment with the rest of the network. One benefit: Cross-border teams will be able to more easily request and provide Snapshots. What’s different: Consistent vocabulary in every territory (for example, you’ll see minor changes like "partially at grade" instead of "partially at level"). Language translation functionality -- especially beneficial as we work closely with our Spanish speaking colleagues in Mexico. The global version does not include the Future Focus Area textbox. In addition to Real-Time Development conversations, we have the ability to capture Future Focus Areas using the Workday Feedback feature. Click here for more info. Snapshot tips: Initiate and complete Snapshots throughout the year as project milestones are met and/or work is completed. Add these reminders to your calendar as appropriate for your role or practice: July 26, Sept. 30, Oct. 31, Dec. 20, Feb. 28, March 31, April 16. Discuss Snapshots with your reviewers. You’ll gain insight on your progression against the PwC Professional and have a better understanding of your impact and development. Aim to receive approximately 6-12 Snapshots during the performance year covering 80% of your total hours worked. For more information on Snapshots, visit the PwC Professional Snapshot page.

Here’s Kristina’s story, in her own words: I really enjoyed reading the story about Amit Acharjya in PwC Inside. It made me think of the small, yet large, changes that PwC has made for me as well. Ever since the firm started offering Well-Being Rewards on Virgin Pulse, I have been addicted to reaching each level in time. I track my sleep to get at least eight hours every night, take as many steps as I can every day (I take the stairs when I used to take the elevator for only one floor), I started eating yogurt or fruit for breakfast instead of nothing, and I take three deep breaths to calm my mind at least once a day using the Whil app to guide me. Thanks to all this effort, I earned enough money from Well-Being Rewards and Real-time recognition to pay for our family vacation two years in a row. We didn't used to go on vacations because we’re so dedicated to working our way out of debt that we put every extra penny toward that. However, when I saw the money I earned through these programs adding up, I told my husband that we should save it for us and see where we ended up by summer time. Last summer, we saved $600 and did a variety of activities in the Tampa/Orlando area, including a day at Legoland that my kids will never forget. This year I got serious about it, and between all the rewards I earned plus the $200 I won in the Digital Lab communities contest, I was able to save $1,000 for our vacation! We got annual passes for Legoland and even got to spend a few days there in an Airbnb. My kids have never taken a vacation where we stayed multiple days overnight before and it was so much fun for us all. So I guess I just want to say thank you, PwC! We now have two years of amazing family vacation memories that we wouldn’t have had without Well-Being Rewards and Be well, work well, not to mention the effect all these new healthy habits are having on my life personally. I didn't spend a single penny of my paycheck on either vacation — that's certainly not normal for the average American who often ends up paying for their vacation months after they take it. So again, thank you! Thank you for being a firm that cares for the well-being of your people. It certainly has made a difference in my life. Download Virgin Pulse for Well-Being Rewards from PwC’s App Store. It keeps you motivated with challenges, healthy habit tracking and tips to Be well, work well — and you earn rewards along the way.

In fact, we’ve found that referrals onboard quickly and tend to stay with the firm longer. Referring experienced candidates can be done easily and quickly in Workday. Type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to get started and find a job that suits someone you know. If a position is available for a referral, a “Refer” button will appear next to the “Apply” button. Click “Refer,” complete the required information and click “Submit.” The candidate will receive an email confirmation with a link to apply for the role. After applying through the link, your referral will be tagged as a referral. To see their status throughout the process, simply type ”My Referrals” in the Workday search bar. As a reminder, you are only eligible for a potential referral reward for hired referrals submitted through Workday (refer to the QRC and policy links below for additional details). Referral payout policy update Referral rewards are eligible for payout 15 days after a referral starts employment at PwC. The referral reward will typically be paid out within two pay periods after the eligibility period. Beginning Sept. 1, payout eligibility will expire 180 days after the eligibility date (15 days after the referral starts). It is your responsibility to follow up with the recruiter if you’re not paid out within the 180-day window. For more information, visit the Employee Referral Program site and review the Refer a Candidate quick reference card (QRC) and policy.

Email isn’t a filing cabinet (but sometimes you need to save one) With our shift to Google and other best-in-class collaboration tools, the days of using email inboxes as a filing cabinet are long gone. To ease the transition to our new ways of working, going forward we’ve put in place a way to let you earmark select email messages to be retained in Google Mail beyond the 18-month retention period. How to save important Google emails Does the email you need to save fall into the category of record data? If so, move it to the appropriate system of record. If the email isn’t record data, but you have a business need to keep it in your inbox: Open the email and select Move to or Label As in the toolbar Select MySavedEmails(US) Your email is now tagged to be retained outside of the 18-month retention period. An email can be tagged to multiple labels and sub-labels, but you must also tag it with the MySavedEmails(US) label in order to retain it outside of the 18-month retention period. PwC will be monitoring use of the MySavedEmails label to ensure we, as a firm, maintain realistic targets for how much we keep outside of the retention period. A good baseline is to aim to save less than 5% of your emails. Again, record data must be stored in the appropriate system of record. Excessive saving of non-record emails outside of the retention period is out of compliance with firm policies. What about My Drive files? The retention period for My Drive files is longer than it is for emails. My Drive files will be deleted 36 months after the “last modified” date. As long as you and your teams are actively working with a file (not just viewing it), you’ll keep resetting the clock on when the information is scheduled to be deleted. If you have a true business need to keep My Drive files for longer than three years, consider whether they would be more appropriately stored in a system of record. Get help! Join a Connect &amp; Learn session Aug. 9 or 16 where we’ll show you how to use the new MySavedEmails label and answer your questions. Schedule a team consultation with the Chief Data Office for help thinking through data management processes that support your team’s specific needs.

Since last year, we’ve been taking consistent steps forward in standardizing how we work with our Acceleration Centers and Centers of Excellence. Phoenix represents just one of the steps on this journey toward standardization, digitizing our business with Your Tomorrow and using technology to simplify your work life. The latest release In the latest version of Phoenix, users will see expanded functionality around things like service building and WBS code lookups; a streamlined version of Advisory’s solutioning service; and, for Assurance, Phoenix will simplify the engagement creation process by replacing the GEM system. Check out the release notes for more details on the new features and visit our Phoenix site for QRCs, videos, FAQs and support. What’s next Within the next few weeks everyone, with limited exceptions, will be using Phoenix to send work to the Acceleration Centers. By Sept. 30, the legacy Assurance and Tax workflow tool, Envoy, will cease to accept new requests (it will still be used by some IFS teams). Phoenix will continue on its agile development journey to add even more functionality — continue to read PwC Inside for updates on each release, and keep sharing your feedback on how we can make Phoenix work best for you! Phoenix in the lines Advisory Beginning July 29, we are eliminating the required download of an offline Acceleration Center SOW contract in Phoenix and streamlining the “SOW Approval” and “Service Intake” requests into one process. With the Advisory solutioning service, Phoenix serves as Advisory’s single source of truth for forecasting for our Acceleration Centers. Assurance This week, we retired GEM — and Phoenix launches Aug. 12 across Core Assurance and most of Risk Assurance. Engagement teams will use Phoenix to request, receive and manage resources and services from our Acceleration Centers — including creating profiles and completing the annual AC Checklist. PCS Assurance was fully onboarded to Phoenix in June and TEA COEs are also now using Phoenix to manage their workflows. Read more about the important actions Assurance teams must take to prepare for the transition and to link Aura databases to new Phoenix profiles. IFS Technical analysis is underway to determine the appropriate approach for onboarding IFS service teams to Phoenix in a timely manner. The focus early on in FY20 is still to transition IFS services off of Envoy and the legacy BPM platform to Phoenix. Collaboration also continues with IFS service teams and Acceleration Centers to define how to best request IFS service support in Phoenix. Tax All non-IAS Tax engagement teams should be using Phoenix for submitting both their engagement forecast and work requests to their Acceleration Center teams. For more information, view the Phoenix in Tax site or discuss with your Acceleration Center contacts. Beginning July 29, the Tax Phoenix workflow will include a two-way feedback option to give a star rating on each of your requests. The new functionality is a quick way to provide feedback on the deliverables you receive from the Acceleration Center.

One of the best features of the updated site is the Home page, which contains “My Feed” — the central location for everything about your day-to-day activities. Based on what we know about you and your role, you’ll receive notifications (known as “nudges”) in My Feed to help guide you to where your attention is needed most. In the feed, you can add nudges to Google Tasks, view more details about why we’re nudging you about a particular topic (like a past-due invoice with the invoice number), and archive a nudge to remove it. If you don’t have any nudges or have archived your entire feed, you’ll see a message saying you’re all caught up! “By the Numbers” is another widget you’ll see on the Home page. This customizable area keeps you up-to-date on the six metrics most important to you. Just click the cog icon or the plus sign, select which metrics you’d like to see, reorder them, and click out. The “Approvals” Home page widget pulls information from different systems across the firm, highlighting areas where you have responsibilities as an approver. This widget will tell you the number of approvals needing your attention, as well as highlight key pieces of information for each system like approval type and days outstanding. For more information Visit the myMetrics Spark page to access a number of resources to learn more about the new site, including FAQ documents and how-to videos like this one, which provides an overview of the myMetrics Home page.

As of July 1, the SDCs supporting the US firm are officially known as Acceleration Centers (ACs) — but there’s much more happening than just a name change. This transformation includes standardizing and automating the work done in our Acceleration Centers, expanding Your Tomorrow to include our AC teams and enhancing the ways we work together on engagements. Today, 13,000 AC staff in eight locations around the world work with individual lines of service in the US and other member firms. These teams are already critical to helping us deliver enhanced quality to our clients while we drive down time and cost of delivery. They provide a wide range of capabilities and services, including core compliance, transfer pricing and other specialized services for Tax; substantive testing, manual controls testing and other audit, attest, and non-audit related services for Assurance; technology, management, risk and strategy consulting services for Advisory; and various support services for IFS teams including Network Information Security, Marketing &amp; Sales and Ethics &amp; Compliance. Now, as we transform and digitize our business, we’ll implement the same strategy and approaches we are already familiar with and working on as a firm to transform our centers to support our new, digital way of working. What does this mean to you? One way this is already happening is through our use of Phoenix for requesting and managing work performed by our ACs. We've been moving toward using Phoenix on 100% of our engagements with ACs and this journey continues. As those of you who are familiar with Phoenix already know, this is a big step forward in terms of consistency and standardization -- and making it simpler to work with the ACs. Our lines of service are working with the PwC Labs teams and the Acceleration Center Strategy Team (formerly our Global Delivery Model Services team) to automate and scale LoS services in the ACs. Watch for more details from your line of service. We’ve been upskilling our AC teams to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation, and so our AC staff have the digital acumen they need to seamlessly work with our engagement teams as we increase the use of digital tools. Nearly 10,000 AC staff have completed Digital Academies and other advanced technology training, and a dedicated Digital Leader and team at each center drive automation and upskilling activities. You’ll be hearing more from your line of service in the coming weeks and months about other steps we’re taking to work more seamlessly with our ACs. Stay tuned!

In this case, teams from PwC’s San Diego and Tijuana offices came together in a One Firm fashion to help deliver a miracle to a struggling family in Mexico. For three days over the span of five months, volunteers from the US and Mexico offices rallied together to raise funds (over $17,000!) and build a three-bedroom home for a family of five. “We volunteered through Build A Miracle, a non-profit organization that provides safe, dignified homes to impoverished families in Tijuana,” said Assurance Senior Manager Scott Dudzik. Forty PwCers from the San Diego and Tijuana offices joined forces in a volunteer effort they hoped would make a significant impact for this border community. “We couldn’t have achieved it without a great deal of teamwork and collaboration,” said Rosalinda Magdaleno, a receptionist in the Tijuana office. “We learned that many of these families live in one-room shacks with dirt floors and no electricity or plumbing,” she explained. Building new homes is just one aspect of how Build a Miracle makes a difference. “They build 40 homes a year — but their impact extends beyond shelter,” said Scott. “We chose to work with Build A Miracle because of their commitment to create a sustainable community.” Build A Miracle families complete 500 hours of community service before being placed on a waiting list for a new home. Rosalinda added, “They also help families through educational programs and community outreach of all kinds, like tutoring, vocational training, scholarships and computer labs — even music and dance classes. It’s about growing a community — and providing the tools and groundwork to thrive.” Once their house is complete, each mission family is asked to stay involved with the community to enhance the area and the lives around them. “It’s a circle of love — a true team effort,” said Rosalinda. The San Diego and Tijuana teams were thrilled to meet their Build A Miracle family and work alongside them to mix and pour the cement foundation and to paint and install drywall and insulation. They were provided step-by-step instructions. “Thank goodness, because we were clueless!” said Rosalinda. “One day we even covered a window in installation materials! We seemed to always be covered in paint or mud, but we learned a lot and in the end, completed a solid home we’re proud of.” The volunteers even orchestrated a big reveal when the house was finished. What followed were happy tears and promises to stay in touch. “We got so close to the family — they kept that promise by sending each of us a heartfelt note of thanks,” said Rosalinda. Teaming with PwCers from across the border also brought its share of joy to our volunteers. “We traveled together by bus to the building site during each visit. That time together was precious,” said Rosalinda. “Getting to know each other during those trips enhanced the entire experience.” “We offered support to the Tijuana community, but they made an impact on us, too,” added Scott. “We got the chance to build relationships with a Build A Miracle family and got to know our colleagues from another office. What a gift!” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/firmwide/miscellaneous/mymetrics-applications.html</url><pwc_title>All-access analytics pass</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-07-23 00:23:06</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>pwc:news-type/firmwide</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>myMetrics’ Applications page connects you to analytics sources across the firm.</pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-07-22 22:17:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>pwc:source/hq-news</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>All-access analytics pass All-access analytics pass HQ News July 22, 2019 Since launching the new myMetrics on June 10, we’ve heard great feedback about how easy it is to use and how robust the metrics are.

Amit Acharjya’s Be well, work well story How sweet it is! Amit Acharjya’s Be well, work well story People Team Aug. 15, 2019 For Senior Associate Amit Acharjya, who works in PwC’s Acceleration Center in Bangalore, taking well-being to new heights began with a few small steps. Here’s his take on why following a simple exercise and nutrition regime was the start of something big — a new lifestyle and frame of mind. One day in October 2017, I was about to take a sip of tea with a couple of teaspoons of sugar, which was my usual habit. Suddenly I realized, I worked hard in the gym today — why sabotage a 90-minute workout? So, no sugar in my tea. The next day, I replaced my twice-a-day milk tea habit (more like, addiction!) with green tea. I was too tired to hit the gym, but then another mind-altering thought hit me — I had been mentally tired of being physically tired for a long time. I decided to go to the gym anyway. That night, I slept well, woke up refreshed and decided to read a book. At one time I was an avid reader, but now I couldn’t remember the last book I had read. Deciding to alter that pattern, too, one book swiftly led to another. With a little willpower, I managed to eradicate sugar from my diet. I sacrificed a few parties but it was worth it. The benefits just kept coming. With better sleep and good nutrition, I found my energy levels elevating, allowing me to lift heavier weights at the gym, resulting in transforming my body and fitness level. Three months after I put down the sugar, I visited my parents for two weeks. I couldn’t smoke my daily cigarettes there (yes, another habit), so this trip presented a good chance to quit smoking once and for all. I did some research and tried to implement deep breathing to calm my mind. While I haven’t quit completely, I’m proud that after five months, I no longer need my daily cigarettes. Soon after joining PwC in April 2019, I heard about the annual TCS World 10K Bangalore race. I had doubts, but registered anyway. The worst that could happen is that I wouldn’t finish. Running at 5 a.m. through the streets of Bangalore alongside thousands of people was a beautiful experience. I completed the run in less than 54 minutes; it was a giant step for me. Sometimes, I feel that all of these changes are too good to be true. I used to live in a vicious and endless loop of depression and anxiety, midnight smokes, sleeplessness and poor nutrition, which would lead to more stress, more sleeplessness, more smoking, and so on. It was a difficult cycle to exit. Reading “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg was another turning point for me; that’s how I learned how habits can change your life. Who knew that exercising daily would lead to a lifestyle full of better nutrition, reading, writing, meditation and a deeper sense of overall well-being? I’m forever grateful that small changes brought such big results. Have your own Be well, work well story to share? Post it on the Spark blog or let us know at us_hq_news@pwc.com.

Navigating between the sub-navigation items is as simple as clicking from one tab to the next.

When Digital Lab launched last November, we challenged you to dive in and explore the community. Now, in our second fiscal year with Digital Lab, we’re raising the bar. Beginning July 1, we’re making changes to how points are redeemed -- and will be paying out up to $1 million in rewards every quarter of FY20. What’s changing on July 1? Points redemption rate will vary by quarter, based on the total number of Digital Lab points earned that quarter across the firm. Maximum redemption rate for 1,000 points will be $150 (currently, points are converted at a rate of 1,000 points = $100). Points will be cashed out automatically at the end of each quarter. Eligible users who earned 500+ points in a quarter will receive an automatic payroll redemption shortly after the end of that quarter, based on the new rates described above. “Current Period” points will reset at the start of each quarter. Now that we’re all using Digital Lab more, you won’t earn points for basic tasks like reviewing and rating, but will continue to earn them a number of other ways. For more information on how to earn points, click here. What will happen to my current Digital Lab points? If you have 250+ points available to be redeemed within Digital Lab as of June 30, you will receive an automatic payroll redemption at a rate of 1,000 points = $100. Are you close to 250 ‘Available’ points but not quite there yet? Check out “Recommendations for You” on your Digital Lab homepage for some automations relevant to you -- and earn points for running/downloading them “Available” points will reset on July 1; any points earned from July 1 onwards will be earned and redeemable according to the FY20 process outlined above. Additional questions about this change? Check out our Rewards one-pager and additional FAQs. And don’t forget to keep visiting Digital Lab each week to check out the new enhancements that launched last month, and find new digital assets relevant to you and your engagement teams. Thank you for all that you do to make our Digital Lab community so impactful! Contact: christie.dachille@pwc.com Quick read July, we’re making changes to points redemption and introducing quarterly payouts up to $1 million. Redemption rates will vary by quarter, based on the total points earned (Max 1,000 points = $150). Users with 500+ points will receive a payroll cash out automatically at the end of each quarter.

Email isn’t a filing cabinet (but sometimes you need to save one) With our shift to Google and other best-in-class collaboration tools, the days of using email inboxes as a filing cabinet are long gone. To ease the transition to our new ways of working, going forward we’ve put in place a way to let you earmark select email messages to be retained in Google Mail beyond the 18-month retention period. How to save important Google emails Does the email you need to save fall into the category of record data? If so, move it to the appropriate system of record. If the email isn’t record data, but you have a business need to keep it in your inbox: Open the email and select Move to or Label As in the toolbar Select MySavedEmails(US) Your email is now tagged to be retained outside of the 18-month retention period. An email can be tagged to multiple labels and sub-labels, but you must also tag it with the MySavedEmails(US) label in order to retain it outside of the 18-month retention period. PwC will be monitoring use of the MySavedEmails label to ensure we, as a firm, maintain realistic targets for how much we keep outside of the retention period. A good baseline is to aim to save less than 5% of your emails. Again, record data must be stored in the appropriate system of record. Excessive saving of non-record emails outside of the retention period is out of compliance with firm policies. What about My Drive files? The retention period for My Drive files is longer than it is for emails. My Drive files will be deleted 36 months after the “last modified” date. As long as you and your teams are actively working with a file (not just viewing it), you’ll keep resetting the clock on when the information is scheduled to be deleted. If you have a true business need to keep My Drive files for longer than three years, consider whether they would be more appropriately stored in a system of record. Get help! Join a Connect &amp; Learn session Aug. 9 or 16 where we’ll show you how to use the new MySavedEmails label and answer your questions. Schedule a team consultation with the Chief Data Office for help thinking through data management processes that support your team’s specific needs.

Since last year, we’ve been taking consistent steps forward in standardizing how we work with our Acceleration Centers and Centers of Excellence. Phoenix represents just one of the steps on this journey toward standardization, digitizing our business with Your Tomorrow and using technology to simplify your work life. The latest release In the latest version of Phoenix, users will see expanded functionality around things like service building and WBS code lookups; a streamlined version of Advisory’s solutioning service; and, for Assurance, Phoenix will simplify the engagement creation process by replacing the GEM system. Check out the release notes for more details on the new features and visit our Phoenix site for QRCs, videos, FAQs and support. What’s next Within the next few weeks everyone, with limited exceptions, will be using Phoenix to send work to the Acceleration Centers. By Sept. 30, the legacy Assurance and Tax workflow tool, Envoy, will cease to accept new requests (it will still be used by some IFS teams). Phoenix will continue on its agile development journey to add even more functionality — continue to read PwC Inside for updates on each release, and keep sharing your feedback on how we can make Phoenix work best for you! Phoenix in the lines Advisory Beginning July 29, we are eliminating the required download of an offline Acceleration Center SOW contract in Phoenix and streamlining the “SOW Approval” and “Service Intake” requests into one process. With the Advisory solutioning service, Phoenix serves as Advisory’s single source of truth for forecasting for our Acceleration Centers. Assurance This week, we retired GEM — and Phoenix launches Aug. 12 across Core Assurance and most of Risk Assurance. Engagement teams will use Phoenix to request, receive and manage resources and services from our Acceleration Centers — including creating profiles and completing the annual AC Checklist. PCS Assurance was fully onboarded to Phoenix in June and TEA COEs are also now using Phoenix to manage their workflows. Read more about the important actions Assurance teams must take to prepare for the transition and to link Aura databases to new Phoenix profiles. IFS Technical analysis is underway to determine the appropriate approach for onboarding IFS service teams to Phoenix in a timely manner. The focus early on in FY20 is still to transition IFS services off of Envoy and the legacy BPM platform to Phoenix. Collaboration also continues with IFS service teams and Acceleration Centers to define how to best request IFS service support in Phoenix. Tax All non-IAS Tax engagement teams should be using Phoenix for submitting both their engagement forecast and work requests to their Acceleration Center teams. For more information, view the Phoenix in Tax site or discuss with your Acceleration Center contacts. Beginning July 29, the Tax Phoenix workflow will include a two-way feedback option to give a star rating on each of your requests. The new functionality is a quick way to provide feedback on the deliverables you receive from the Acceleration Center.

One of the best features of the updated site is the Home page, which contains “My Feed” — the central location for everything about your day-to-day activities. Based on what we know about you and your role, you’ll receive notifications (known as “nudges”) in My Feed to help guide you to where your attention is needed most. In the feed, you can add nudges to Google Tasks, view more details about why we’re nudging you about a particular topic (like a past-due invoice with the invoice number), and archive a nudge to remove it. If you don’t have any nudges or have archived your entire feed, you’ll see a message saying you’re all caught up! “By the Numbers” is another widget you’ll see on the Home page. This customizable area keeps you up-to-date on the six metrics most important to you. Just click the cog icon or the plus sign, select which metrics you’d like to see, reorder them, and click out. The “Approvals” Home page widget pulls information from different systems across the firm, highlighting areas where you have responsibilities as an approver. This widget will tell you the number of approvals needing your attention, as well as highlight key pieces of information for each system like approval type and days outstanding.

As of July 1, the SDCs supporting the US firm are officially known as Acceleration Centers (ACs) — but there’s much more happening than just a name change. This transformation includes standardizing and automating the work done in our Acceleration Centers, expanding Your Tomorrow to include our AC teams and enhancing the ways we work together on engagements. Today, 13,000 AC staff in eight locations around the world work with individual lines of service in the US and other member firms. These teams are already critical to helping us deliver enhanced quality to our clients while we drive down time and cost of delivery. They provide a wide range of capabilities and services, including core compliance, transfer pricing and other specialized services for Tax; substantive testing, manual controls testing and other audit, attest, and non-audit related services for Assurance; technology, management, risk and strategy consulting services for Advisory; and various support services for IFS teams including Network Information Security, Marketing &amp; Sales and Ethics &amp; Compliance. Now, as we transform and digitize our business, we’ll implement the same strategy and approaches we are already familiar with and working on as a firm to transform our centers to support our new, digital way of working. What does this mean to you? One way this is already happening is through our use of Phoenix for requesting and managing work performed by our ACs. We've been moving toward using Phoenix on 100% of our engagements with ACs and this journey continues. As those of you who are familiar with Phoenix already know, this is a big step forward in terms of consistency and standardization -- and making it simpler to work with the ACs. Our lines of service are working with the PwC Labs teams and the Acceleration Center Strategy Team (formerly our Global Delivery Model Services team) to automate and scale LoS services in the ACs. Watch for more details from your line of service. We’ve been upskilling our AC teams to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation, and so our AC staff have the digital acumen they need to seamlessly work with our engagement teams as we increase the use of digital tools. Nearly 10,000 AC staff have completed Digital Academies and other advanced technology training, and a dedicated Digital Leader and team at each center drive automation and upskilling activities. You’ll be hearing more from your line of service in the coming weeks and months about other steps we’re taking to work more seamlessly with our ACs. Stay tuned!

When Digital Lab launched last November, we challenged you to dive in and explore the community. Now, in our second fiscal year with Digital Lab, we’re raising the bar. Beginning July 1, we’re making changes to how points are redeemed -- and will be paying out up to $1 million in rewards every quarter of FY20. What’s changing on July 1? Points redemption rate will vary by quarter, based on the total number of Digital Lab points earned that quarter across the firm. Maximum redemption rate for 1,000 points will be $150 (currently, points are converted at a rate of 1,000 points = $100). Points will be cashed out automatically at the end of each quarter. Eligible users who earned 500+ points in a quarter will receive an automatic payroll redemption shortly after the end of that quarter, based on the new rates described above. “Current Period” points will reset at the start of each quarter. Now that we’re all using Digital Lab more, you won’t earn points for basic tasks like reviewing and rating, but will continue to earn them a number of other ways. For more information on how to earn points, click here. What will happen to my current Digital Lab points? If you have 250+ points available to be redeemed within Digital Lab as of June 30, you will receive an automatic payroll redemption at a rate of 1,000 points = $100. Are you close to 250 ‘Available’ points but not quite there yet? Check out “Recommendations for You” on your Digital Lab homepage for some automations relevant to you -- and earn points for running/downloading them “Available” points will reset on July 1; any points earned from July 1 onwards will be earned and redeemable according to the FY20 process outlined above. Additional questions about this change? Check out our Rewards one-pager and additional FAQs. And don’t forget to keep visiting Digital Lab each week to check out the new enhancements that launched last month, and find new digital assets relevant to you and your engagement teams. Thank you for all that you do to make our Digital Lab community so impactful! Contact: christie.dachille@pwc.com Quick read July, we’re making changes to points redemption and introducing quarterly payouts up to $1 million. Redemption rates will vary by quarter, based on the total points earned (Max 1,000 points = $150). Users with 500+ points will receive a payroll cash out automatically at the end of each quarter.

Washington Update: Oversight or overreach? Office of Government June 13, 2019 For internal use only. A message from Roslyn Brooks, Government, Regulatory Affairs &amp; Public Policy leader. Overview What is prudent, constitutionally mandated congressional oversight, and what is partisan, politically motivated overreach? It’s a question that has challenged lawmakers and voters alike throughout our country’s storied history. Recently, the Democratic-controlled House has issued multiple subpoenas related to the president’s tax returns and the Mueller report; voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress for his failure to comply with their subpoena; and wrestled with whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings against the president. Some argue these actions skew more toward overreach than oversight. However, the question of overreach extends beyond congressional investigations. President Trump’s use of emergency powers to access money to build a wall on the Mexican border had even some Republicans questioning the action as a potential overreach of executive power. What does this political landscape portend for our firm and our clients? The oversight/overreach dynamic has become a political tug of war, exacerbating an already hyper-partisan environment in which each party appears focused on appeasing its respective base. As outlined in previous communications, the potential for alignment of politics and policy continues to narrow between the parties. Political polls show there is low urgency for either party to work together toward significant legislation at this point in the election cycle. In 2019, Congress’ and the president’s approval ratings have been at their highest points since the Trump presidency began, despite having few significant legislative achievements to show this year. Both sides generally feel the current strategy of working together when politically feasible and pushing their own agenda at all other times is a winning blueprint for success in 2020. Against this backdrop, expect the Trump administration to continue pushing its “America First” agenda, particularly focused on issues like immigration and trade. The Republican-controlled Senate can be expected to continue its focus on confirming executive and judicial branch nominees, made easier by a Senate rule change that reduces debate time for certain nominees from 30 hours to two hours. And in the Democratic-controlled House, the majority likely will continue oversight of the Trump administration, including investigating the findings raised in the Mueller report, as well as putting forward their own legislative proposals around healthcare, immigration, and pay equity, among others. Importantly, businesses must remain nimble and engaged on their policy priorities despite this outlook for continued gridlock. The legislative landscape has the potential to shift direction as fast as a presidential tweet. Congress There is an abundance of historical precedent for partisan gridlock to lead to legislative inaction. In fact, recent history seems to prove true the old adage asking ‘what does Congress do well? Nothing and overreacting.’ The 112th and 113th Congresses (2011-2014), which featured a Democratic-controlled White House and Senate and Republican-controlled House (an inverse of the current political makeup), were the least productive in modern history with 284 and 296 laws enacted, respectively. Those numbers pale in comparison to the 115th Congress (2017-2018), which enacted 440 laws when Republicans had unified control of the government. In the current Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has referred to himself as the legislative “Grim Reaper,” saying that much, if not all, of the House Democrats' policy agenda will be dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate. Moreover, President Trump has indicated he will not work with Democrats on major legislative initiatives as long as they pursue oversight investigations into him and his administration, throwing cold water on hopes for such bipartisan compromises as infrastructure. For nearly a decade, Congress has legislated by deadline and that trend seems unlikely to abate anytime soon. Accordingly, our clients should look toward must-pass legislation as a guide for what is to come. The most significant piece of legislation that needs to pass before the August recess is the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The bill is traditionally viewed as must-pass and is historically bipartisan in nature. Retirement security, drug pricing and infrastructure also continue to be bipartisan concepts in nature, but finding a path forward on any of these items continues to be a challenge. Congress is also working on crafting bipartisan comprehensive privacy legislation, but whether to include a federal standard that preempts state law, in particular the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), has become a contentious issue. Further complicating negotiations are the multiple committees that share jurisdiction over data privacy legislation. As lawmakers narrow their focus on data privacy and data governance issues, technology firms are becoming acutely exposed to increasing regulation and a fragmented environment. In fact, the House Judiciary Committee recently opened an antitrust investigation into big tech companies. We expect to see continued efforts around the regulation of big tech companies, whether through the form of privacy laws, hateful content restrictions or competition probes. New privacy regulations in particular could extend to financial institutions as well, depending on how they are crafted. Under the gavel of Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), the House Financial Services Committee has turned its attention from financial deregulation to consumer protections, housing finance, workers’ rights, diversity and inclusion, oversight and anti-money laundering efforts, among others. The committee also recently formed task forces to examine new technologies, focusing specifically on fintech and artificial intelligence. As we look toward the fall, Congress faces a number of potential economic uncertainties on the horizon: Rising concern over a trade resolution with China; a battle over ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA); potential North American Free Trade Agreement withdrawal; and a showdown over government funding and the debt limit. Government funding is set to expire on September 30, around the same time the Treasury Department has said they will be unable to use extraordinary measures to pay the country’s debt. Global Economists project that US trade policies, particularly the Trump administration’s use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool, are creating market uncertainties that risk denting US growth and adding to headwinds that could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the next year. Those uncertainties were recently epitomized when President Trump announced late last month that he would impose a 5% tariff on all goods from Mexico unless its leaders took steps to curb illegal immigration into the US. The threat was rescinded last week after an agreement was reached with the Mexican government. The president's tariff threat was a reminder how quickly US foreign policy can shift under the current administration, but it also highlighted the administration’s use of tariffs as an effective foreign policy tool. Many lawmakers remain optimistic about USMCA ratification prospects, but business leaders would be wise to prepare for more twists and turns. Issues around border security, enforceability of labor and environmental standards, as well as labor union support are all issues that need to be ironed out. Procedurally, the Trump administration has initiated the process for expedited consideration of the USMCA by submitting a formal Statement of Administrative Action, but the earliest the implementing bill could be sent to Congress is July. This is a significant development, particularly in light of Mexico and Canada’s recent steps toward ratification. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland presented a motion to begin the ratification process for the trade deal, while Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has asked their legislative body to hold a special session before September to formally approve the USMCA. On another trade front, the expectation (or hope) for greater clarity around the US-China trade dispute may be realized this month at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The two countries have traded escalating tariffs, with China imposing levies of 5% to 25% on $60 billion worth of US goods in response to President Trump raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods last month. President Trump also gave the EU and Japan 180 days to agree to a deal that would “limit” or “restrict” imports of cars and parts into the US as a move to delay new auto tariffs. Analysts worry the latest tariff escalation will drive up the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation, and a further acceleration could have a greater impact on economic growth. If the US, China and other countries continue to raise retaliatory tariffs, the negative effects may no longer be confined to a handful of industries in the US, but instead risk being felt around the globe. Across the pond, trade complications continue in Europe. British lawmakers continue to struggle on a path forward for Brexit. After the negotiated agreement by Prime Minister Theresa May failed to pass for a fourth time, May announced her resignation effective June 7, triggering a leadership contest. Further complicating matters are the recent European parliamentary elections which resulted in the victory of populist candidates in several countries, including a number from the hardline UK Independence Party. US leaders will be watching closely this summer. In addition to Brexit concerns, the UK Parliament’s Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy Committee issued a 100-page report in April on the future of audit. The report includes a number of recommendations, including separating the UK audit and non-audit businesses. These recommendations are the beginning of the process, however, and there are other reviews, some still underway, and future opportunities for input. PwC UK announced this month a package of measures designed to ensure high quality audits, including further alignment of its audit and risk assurance practices, creating a practice with a single focus on external audit and strengthening its governance with their Independent Non-Executives, among other measures. SEC/FASB At the SEC, Commissioners recently voted to propose amendments that would revise the definitions of “accelerated filer” and “large accelerated filer,” essentially expanding the population of public companies that are non-accelerated filers. Under the proposal, companies (subject to some exceptions) that have a public float between $75 million and $700 million, and revenues of less than $100 million, would become non-accelerated filers and would, therefore, be exempt from auditor attestation required under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. The comment period for the proposal closes in July. The Commission also recently adopted its own standard of conduct rules that require brokers and other salespeople to act in the best interests of their customers when making recommendations about investments, as well as to disclose potential conflicts of interest to their customers. Some of the rules will become effective immediately, while others will become effective 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register, and will include a transition period until June 30, 2020. The Senate Banking Committee held a confirmation hearing on June 5 for Allison Lee, nominee for the open Democratic commissioner slot at the SEC, and the committee and full Senate may vote to confirm her as early as this month. It has been reported that Commissioner Robert Jackson may also step down as soon as Lee is confirmed, creating another Democratic vacancy at the Commission. Additionally, following the announcement that former PwC partner and Chief Accountant Wes Bricker planned to leave the agency this month, the SEC named Sagar Teotia as acting Chief Accountant. Teotia, who formerly served as Deputy Chief Accountant, will now serve as the principal advisor to the Commission on accounting and auditing matters, and will be responsible for assisting the Commission with discharging its oversight of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). US lawmakers also have shown a growing interest in FASB’s Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard. Bipartisan letters in both the House and the Senate and legislation in the Senate have called for the standard to be studied further and delayed for up to two years. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has encouraged FASB to engage with stakeholders to assess the potential impact of implementation on different sized institutions. State and local While some state legislatures are winding down their legislative sessions, others are just getting going. Only five states will hold statewide elections in 2019: Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi will elect new governors, while Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Virginia will hold legislative elections. Two major issues caught our attention in state legislatures this year: taxation of professional services and anti-arbitration initiatives. Twelve states saw the introduction of legislation that would expand the sales and use tax base to professional services, including accounting. To date, 22 “taxation of services” bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. Despite the number of states exploring the issue, none have successfully implemented a broad sales tax expansion to services yet. California and Connecticut saw serious efforts to explore this issue this year, but both efforts appear stalled at this point in time. Legislatures across the country also continue to introduce bills that would curtail or bar the use of arbitration in employment agreements. Some measures would ban only the concealment of sexual harassment settlements or limit arbitration in discrimination or sexual harassment disputes, while others seek to ban arbitration in employment contracts altogether. New Jersey became the first state to enact a total ban on employment arbitration agreements earlier this year, a measure which may be in conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act and US Supreme Court precedent. California and Illinois are actively considering similar legislation. And in Colorado, an effort to move an anti-arbitration bill failed this session in the face of opposition from the business community. Conclusion Eight years ago this spring, several newly-elected freshman House members taped a letter on the door of the then Senate Majority Leader demanding that he act on several pieces of key legislation that the House had already passed. These newly-elected members declared that “the American people did not send us here to fail and we do not accept your failure as our own.” The newly-elected freshmen were part of the GOP majority that took over after the 2010 election and the Majority Leader was former Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). Reid chose to ignore the House GOP agenda in an attempt to protect his incumbent president ahead of the next election. Reid’s strategy worked as President Obama was easily reelected and Democrats even gained seats in the Senate. Although many of the players have changed in the last eight years, the current dynamic is almost a mirror image with inverse party control. Similarly to back then, most near-term activity in Washington will be amplified through the political lens of the 2020 presidential race. In less than two weeks, the first of six Democratic presidential debates this year will take place in Miami. With 23 credible Democratic candidates running as of this writing, the most since 1924, the upcoming presidential debates have the potential to provide some clarity around front runners and newcomers. While 23 candidates seems like a lot, and it is, Republicans fielded 16 candidates at this point last election cycle. In fact, Donald Trump did not officially enter the race until June 16, 2015. Given November 2020 is more than 17 months away, it is understandable one might view the election as a distant, far-off event. But with California moving up its primary date, 40% of all delegates will now be allocated by the end of March. And although the presidential race may be the headline grabber, 31 House Democrats will be up for reelection in districts carried by President Trump, compared to just three Republicans in districts carried by Secretary Clinton, putting Democrats’ current 38-seat majority at stake. In the Senate, Democrats have 12 seats to defend compared to 22 seats for Republicans. That number may be misleading, however, as Democrats will need a net gain of three seats if their party’s nominee beats President Trump in November and a four-seat pickup if the president is reelected (due to the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote). Only in two of the last five elections has either party picked up more than three Senate seats. The lone indisputable fact is that no one knows what event or factor may ultimately take place between now and the election that could significantly alter the 2020 landscape. In the near term, however, expect the “oversight vs. overreach” dynamic and legislative stagnation to continue to dominate the political climate, even if the effects are not fully realized for some time.

As of July 1, the SDCs supporting the US firm will officially be known as Acceleration Centers (ACs) — but there’s much more happening than just a name change. This transformation includes standardizing and automating the work done in our Service Delivery Centers, expanding Your Tomorrow to include our SDC teams and enhancing the ways we work together on engagements. Today, 13,000 SDC staff in eight locations around the world work with individual lines of service in the US and other member firms. These teams are already critical to helping us deliver enhanced quality to our clients while we drive down time and cost of delivery. They provide a wide range of capabilities and services, including core compliance, transfer pricing and other specialized services for Tax; substantive testing, manual controls testing and other audit, attest, and non-audit related services for Assurance; technology, management, risk and strategy consulting services for Advisory; and various support services for IFS teams including Network Information Security, Marketing &amp; Sales and Ethics &amp; Compliance. Now, as we transform and digitize our business, we’ll implement the same strategy and approaches we are already familiar with and working on as a firm to transform our centers to support our new, digital way of working. What does this mean to you? One way this is already happening is through our use of Phoenix for requesting and managing work performed by our ACs. We've been moving toward using Phoenix on 100% of our engagements with ACs and this journey continues. As those of you who are familiar with Phoenix already know, this is a big step forward in terms of consistency and standardization -- and making it simpler to work with the ACs. Our lines of service are working with the PwC Labs teams and the Acceleration Center Strategy Team (formerly our Global Delivery Model Services team) to automate and scale LoS services in the ACs. Watch for more details from your line of service. We’ve been upskilling our AC teams to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation, and so our AC staff have the digital acumen they need to seamlessly work with our engagement teams as we increase the use of digital tools.

Washington Update: Oversight or overreach? Office of Government June 13, 2019 For internal use only. A message from Roslyn Brooks, Government, Regulatory Affairs &amp; Public Policy leader. Overview What is prudent, constitutionally mandated congressional oversight, and what is partisan, politically motivated overreach? It’s a question that has challenged lawmakers and voters alike throughout our country’s storied history. Recently, the Democratic-controlled House has issued multiple subpoenas related to the president’s tax returns and the Mueller report; voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress for his failure to comply with their subpoena; and wrestled with whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings against the president. Some argue these actions skew more toward overreach than oversight. However, the question of overreach extends beyond congressional investigations. President Trump’s use of emergency powers to access money to build a wall on the Mexican border had even some Republicans questioning the action as a potential overreach of executive power. What does this political landscape portend for our firm and our clients? The oversight/overreach dynamic has become a political tug of war, exacerbating an already hyper-partisan environment in which each party appears focused on appeasing its respective base. As outlined in previous communications, the potential for alignment of politics and policy continues to narrow between the parties. Political polls show there is low urgency for either party to work together toward significant legislation at this point in the election cycle. In 2019, Congress’ and the president’s approval ratings have been at their highest points since the Trump presidency began, despite having few significant legislative achievements to show this year. Both sides generally feel the current strategy of working together when politically feasible and pushing their own agenda at all other times is a winning blueprint for success in 2020. Against this backdrop, expect the Trump administration to continue pushing its “America First” agenda, particularly focused on issues like immigration and trade. The Republican-controlled Senate can be expected to continue its focus on confirming executive and judicial branch nominees, made easier by a Senate rule change that reduces debate time for certain nominees from 30 hours to two hours. And in the Democratic-controlled House, the majority likely will continue oversight of the Trump administration, including investigating the findings raised in the Mueller report, as well as putting forward their own legislative proposals around healthcare, immigration, and pay equity, among others. Importantly, businesses must remain nimble and engaged on their policy priorities despite this outlook for continued gridlock. The legislative landscape has the potential to shift direction as fast as a presidential tweet. Congress There is an abundance of historical precedent for partisan gridlock to lead to legislative inaction. In fact, recent history seems to prove true the old adage asking ‘what does Congress do well? Nothing and overreacting.’ The 112th and 113th Congresses (2011-2014), which featured a Democratic-controlled White House and Senate and Republican-controlled House (an inverse of the current political makeup), were the least productive in modern history with 284 and 296 laws enacted, respectively. Those numbers pale in comparison to the 115th Congress (2017-2018), which enacted 440 laws when Republicans had unified control of the government. In the current Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has referred to himself as the legislative “Grim Reaper,” saying that much, if not all, of the House Democrats' policy agenda will be dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate. Moreover, President Trump has indicated he will not work with Democrats on major legislative initiatives as long as they pursue oversight investigations into him and his administration, throwing cold water on hopes for such bipartisan compromises as infrastructure. For nearly a decade, Congress has legislated by deadline and that trend seems unlikely to abate anytime soon. Accordingly, our clients should look toward must-pass legislation as a guide for what is to come. The most significant piece of legislation that needs to pass before the August recess is the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The bill is traditionally viewed as must-pass and is historically bipartisan in nature. Retirement security, drug pricing and infrastructure also continue to be bipartisan concepts in nature, but finding a path forward on any of these items continues to be a challenge. Congress is also working on crafting bipartisan comprehensive privacy legislation, but whether to include a federal standard that preempts state law, in particular the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), has become a contentious issue. Further complicating negotiations are the multiple committees that share jurisdiction over data privacy legislation. As lawmakers narrow their focus on data privacy and data governance issues, technology firms are becoming acutely exposed to increasing regulation and a fragmented environment. In fact, the House Judiciary Committee recently opened an antitrust investigation into big tech companies. We expect to see continued efforts around the regulation of big tech companies, whether through the form of privacy laws, hateful content restrictions or competition probes. New privacy regulations in particular could extend to financial institutions as well, depending on how they are crafted. Under the gavel of Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), the House Financial Services Committee has turned its attention from financial deregulation to consumer protections, housing finance, workers’ rights, diversity and inclusion, oversight and anti-money laundering efforts, among others. The committee also recently formed task forces to examine new technologies, focusing specifically on fintech and artificial intelligence. As we look toward the fall, Congress faces a number of potential economic uncertainties on the horizon: Rising concern over a trade resolution with China; a battle over ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA); potential North American Free Trade Agreement withdrawal; and a showdown over government funding and the debt limit. Government funding is set to expire on September 30, around the same time the Treasury Department has said they will be unable to use extraordinary measures to pay the country’s debt. Global Economists project that US trade policies, particularly the Trump administration’s use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool, are creating market uncertainties that risk denting US growth and adding to headwinds that could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the next year. Those uncertainties were recently epitomized when President Trump announced late last month that he would impose a 5% tariff on all goods from Mexico unless its leaders took steps to curb illegal immigration into the US. The threat was rescinded last week after an agreement was reached with the Mexican government. The president's tariff threat was a reminder how quickly US foreign policy can shift under the current administration, but it also highlighted the administration’s use of tariffs as an effective foreign policy tool. Many lawmakers remain optimistic about USMCA ratification prospects, but business leaders would be wise to prepare for more twists and turns. Issues around border security, enforceability of labor and environmental standards, as well as labor union support are all issues that need to be ironed out. Procedurally, the Trump administration has initiated the process for expedited consideration of the USMCA by submitting a formal Statement of Administrative Action, but the earliest the implementing bill could be sent to Congress is July. This is a significant development, particularly in light of Mexico and Canada’s recent steps toward ratification. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland presented a motion to begin the ratification process for the trade deal, while Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has asked their legislative body to hold a special session before September to formally approve the USMCA. On another trade front, the expectation (or hope) for greater clarity around the US-China trade dispute may be realized this month at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The two countries have traded escalating tariffs, with China imposing levies of 5% to 25% on $60 billion worth of US goods in response to President Trump raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods last month. President Trump also gave the EU and Japan 180 days to agree to a deal that would “limit” or “restrict” imports of cars and parts into the US as a move to delay new auto tariffs. Analysts worry the latest tariff escalation will drive up the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation, and a further acceleration could have a greater impact on economic growth. If the US, China and other countries continue to raise retaliatory tariffs, the negative effects may no longer be confined to a handful of industries in the US, but instead risk being felt around the globe. Across the pond, trade complications continue in Europe. British lawmakers continue to struggle on a path forward for Brexit. After the negotiated agreement by Prime Minister Theresa May failed to pass for a fourth time, May announced her resignation effective June 7, triggering a leadership contest. Further complicating matters are the recent European parliamentary elections which resulted in the victory of populist candidates in several countries, including a number from the hardline UK Independence Party. US leaders will be watching closely this summer. In addition to Brexit concerns, the UK Parliament’s Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy Committee issued a 100-page report in April on the future of audit. The report includes a number of recommendations, including separating the UK audit and non-audit businesses. These recommendations are the beginning of the process, however, and there are other reviews, some still underway, and future opportunities for input. PwC UK announced this month a package of measures designed to ensure high quality audits, including further alignment of its audit and risk assurance practices, creating a practice with a single focus on external audit and strengthening its governance with their Independent Non-Executives, among other measures. SEC/FASB At the SEC, Commissioners recently voted to propose amendments that would revise the definitions of “accelerated filer” and “large accelerated filer,” essentially expanding the population of public companies that are non-accelerated filers. Under the proposal, companies (subject to some exceptions) that have a public float between $75 million and $700 million, and revenues of less than $100 million, would become non-accelerated filers and would, therefore, be exempt from auditor attestation required under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. The comment period for the proposal closes in July. The Commission also recently adopted its own standard of conduct rules that require brokers and other salespeople to act in the best interests of their customers when making recommendations about investments, as well as to disclose potential conflicts of interest to their customers. Some of the rules will become effective immediately, while others will become effective 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register, and will include a transition period until June 30, 2020. The Senate Banking Committee held a confirmation hearing on June 5 for Allison Lee, nominee for the open Democratic commissioner slot at the SEC, and the committee and full Senate may vote to confirm her as early as this month. It has been reported that Commissioner Robert Jackson may also step down as soon as Lee is confirmed, creating another Democratic vacancy at the Commission. Additionally, following the announcement that former PwC partner and Chief Accountant Wes Bricker planned to leave the agency this month, the SEC named Sagar Teotia as acting Chief Accountant. Teotia, who formerly served as Deputy Chief Accountant, will now serve as the principal advisor to the Commission on accounting and auditing matters, and will be responsible for assisting the Commission with discharging its oversight of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). US lawmakers also have shown a growing interest in FASB’s Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard. Bipartisan letters in both the House and the Senate and legislation in the Senate have called for the standard to be studied further and delayed for up to two years. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has encouraged FASB to engage with stakeholders to assess the potential impact of implementation on different sized institutions. State and local While some state legislatures are winding down their legislative sessions, others are just getting going. Only five states will hold statewide elections in 2019: Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi will elect new governors, while Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Virginia will hold legislative elections. Two major issues caught our attention in state legislatures this year: taxation of professional services and anti-arbitration initiatives. Twelve states saw the introduction of legislation that would expand the sales and use tax base to professional services, including accounting. To date, 22 “taxation of services” bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. Despite the number of states exploring the issue, none have successfully implemented a broad sales tax expansion to services yet. California and Connecticut saw serious efforts to explore this issue this year, but both efforts appear stalled at this point in time. Legislatures across the country also continue to introduce bills that would curtail or bar the use of arbitration in employment agreements. Some measures would ban only the concealment of sexual harassment settlements or limit arbitration in discrimination or sexual harassment disputes, while others seek to ban arbitration in employment contracts altogether. New Jersey became the first state to enact a total ban on employment arbitration agreements earlier this year, a measure which may be in conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act and US Supreme Court precedent. California and Illinois are actively considering similar legislation. And in Colorado, an effort to move an anti-arbitration bill failed this session in the face of opposition from the business community. Conclusion Eight years ago this spring, several newly-elected freshman House members taped a letter on the door of the then Senate Majority Leader demanding that he act on several pieces of key legislation that the House had already passed. These newly-elected members declared that “the American people did not send us here to fail and we do not accept your failure as our own.” The newly-elected freshmen were part of the GOP majority that took over after the 2010 election and the Majority Leader was former Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). Reid chose to ignore the House GOP agenda in an attempt to protect his incumbent president ahead of the next election. Reid’s strategy worked as President Obama was easily reelected and Democrats even gained seats in the Senate. Although many of the players have changed in the last eight years, the current dynamic is almost a mirror image with inverse party control. Similarly to back then, most near-term activity in Washington will be amplified through the political lens of the 2020 presidential race. In less than two weeks, the first of six Democratic presidential debates this year will take place in Miami. With 23 credible Democratic candidates running as of this writing, the most since 1924, the upcoming presidential debates have the potential to provide some clarity around front runners and newcomers. While 23 candidates seems like a lot, and it is, Republicans fielded 16 candidates at this point last election cycle. In fact, Donald Trump did not officially enter the race until June 16, 2015. Given November 2020 is more than 17 months away, it is understandable one might view the election as a distant, far-off event. But with California moving up its primary date, 40% of all delegates will now be allocated by the end of March. And although the presidential race may be the headline grabber, 31 House Democrats will be up for reelection in districts carried by President Trump, compared to just three Republicans in districts carried by Secretary Clinton, putting Democrats’ current 38-seat majority at stake. In the Senate, Democrats have 12 seats to defend compared to 22 seats for Republicans. That number may be misleading, however, as Democrats will need a net gain of three seats if their party’s nominee beats President Trump in November and a four-seat pickup if the president is reelected (due to the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote). Only in two of the last five elections has either party picked up more than three Senate seats. The lone indisputable fact is that no one knows what event or factor may ultimately take place between now and the election that could significantly alter the 2020 landscape. In the near term, however, expect the “oversight vs. overreach” dynamic and legislative stagnation to continue to dominate the political climate, even if the effects are not fully realized for some time.

As of July 1, the SDCs supporting the US firm will officially be known as Acceleration Centers (ACs) — but there’s much more happening than just a name change. This transformation includes standardizing and automating the work done in our Service Delivery Centers, expanding Your Tomorrow to include our SDC teams and enhancing the ways we work together on engagements. Today, 13,000 SDC staff in eight locations around the world work with individual lines of service in the US and other member firms. These teams are already critical to helping us deliver enhanced quality to our clients while we drive down time and cost of delivery. They provide a wide range of capabilities and services, including core compliance, transfer pricing and other specialized services for Tax; substantive testing, manual controls testing and other audit, attest, and non-audit related services for Assurance; technology, management, risk and strategy consulting services for Advisory; and various support services for IFS teams including Network Information Security, Marketing &amp; Sales and Ethics &amp; Compliance. Now, as we transform and digitize our business, we’ll implement the same strategy and approaches we are already familiar with and working on as a firm to transform our centers to support our new, digital way of working. What does this mean to you? One way this is already happening is through our use of Phoenix for requesting and managing work performed by our ACs. We've been moving toward using Phoenix on 100% of our engagements with ACs and this journey continues. As those of you who are familiar with Phoenix already know, this is a big step forward in terms of consistency and standardization -- and making it simpler to work with the ACs. Our lines of service are working with the PwC Labs teams and the Acceleration Center Strategy Team (formerly our Global Delivery Model Services team) to automate and scale LoS services in the ACs. Watch for more details from your line of service. We’ve been upskilling our AC teams to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation, and so our AC staff have the digital acumen they need to seamlessly work with our engagement teams as we increase the use of digital tools.

The goal was to identify ways to optimize the volumes of sales, marketing and customer relationship data M&amp;S works with every day — specifically the data that feeds their Eloqua marketing automation system — by applying PwC’s Data Governance Framework. Kimberly Frazier, CDO senior associate and Digital Accelerator, brought a consultative approach to working with Paul McInnis and Edward Rodriguez from the M&amp;S team. As they do with all the teams they partner with, the CDO worked to understand the M&amp;S team’s challenges, listened closely to drill down into the specific areas where their processes could improve, and identified bite-sized steps they could take toward further optimizing their data governance. Building from a model Kimberly developed to pinpoint anomalies in large data sets, the team was able to immediately automate their data cleansing process, saving weeks of time. While working with Kimberly and the CDO, Paul and Edward both attended Digital Academies. Edward was able to apply his Digital Academy learning to take Kimberly’s foundational process automations and expand their application to even more areas, finding opportunities to standardize data formatting, eliminate unnecessary data and consolidate duplications. With some digital mentoring from Kimberly, Paul and Edward have opened the door to continue improving their data processes in a tangible and practical way. Kudos to this team for empowering themselves to apply what they’ve learned! Want to collaborate with the CDO? The CDO is here to partner and consult with teams to help them identify the most valuable data, automations and processes to optimize use of our firm’s data assets. Reach out to the CDO to request a consultation.

Prior to the launch of the new system, extensive testing needed to occur to confirm that the system was suited to the client’s unique needs. Testing of this nature can be very time consuming and repetitive — especially for customer-facing applications — so the Advisory team worked with their Digital Accelerator Scott Upchurch on innovative ways to digitize the routine tasks. In addition, every member of the team attended a Digital Academy to improve their digital skills and support their team collaboration. “Everyone on the team really caught the fever of digital acceleration,” said Scott. “We constantly discussed new ideas for bots and ways to automate routine tasks in our work for the client to not only improve the way we work, but to keep our work exciting.” The team developed three new solutions to help reduce the time needed to test the client’s new system: The Test Data Bot for use during trials of mass uploads of customer account information, which reduced the time required by the team to test data by 85%; The Status Reporter Workflow to generate daily reporting emails by calculating key metrics and outputs from data in a Google Sheet, which reduced the team’s manual reconciliation efforts by 95%; and The Universal Reconciliation Application that can reconcile data between any two data sets and generate a report for all unmatched and matched data to help validate source and destination system data, which reduced the team’s manual reconciliation efforts by 90%. New Digital Lab solution coming soon! In total, the team saved more than 217 hours and developed a solution to share in Digital Lab! The Universal Reconciliation Application solution should be available later this month, so check back soon to access it. Until then, continue to hone your digital skills to improve your team collaboration by attending a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion session — click here for information on which session to attend and how to register. Also, it’s important to remember this is a different conversation for our audit and non-audit clients. For our audit clients and their affiliates, please follow independence rules and obtain appropriate audit committee pre-approvals, where applicable.

Your Tomorrow involves everyone. Smart Platform is a great example of how teaming across the PwC network brought a Business-led automation to life that will further enhance quality and reduce manual hours. Financial Statement Tie-Out is the second largest Assurance activity performed by the ACs. Through our close partnership with the Manila AC and exploration of digital solutions, the PwC US Assurance team learned that PwC Australia had developed an early-stage automation solution to assist in testing Financial Statement mathematical accuracy. They then teamed with PwC Australia to co-develop Smart Platform, a more sophisticated platform to handle the complexity of US Financial Statements and to accelerate the automation of new functionality in order to further reduce manual involvement. Smart Platform uses algorithms and AI machine learning to re-perform the calculations in each table of a Financial Statement. Going forward, the ACs will use this tool on all Financial Statements that meet the tool criteria. Up next -- the Smart Platform will facilitate a significant increase in the automation of agreeing Prior Year amounts and performing Internal Consistency between the financial statements and footnotes. These automations are expected to further enhance quality and reduce manual hours in the ACs year over year while increasing the speed at which the ACs can support engagement teams. What you can do? Continue to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation and work with ACs to automate and scale LoS services.

This change would require the team to apply several layers of filters and vlookups by jurisdiction and legal entities in order to agree deferred tax balances to the trial balance. Instead of spending hours performing these tasks manually, they quickly engaged a Digital Accelerator to prepare a workflow that allowed them to input specific legal entities and have the workflow apply the filters/vlookups. This produced two impactful results -- first, the workflow agreed the deferred tax balances to the trial balance by legal entity, and second, it saved the team a significant amount of time sorting trial balances to produce this result. By saving approximately 10% of the total tax provision hours during one of the most crucial weeks of year-end fieldwork, members of the team could be redeployed on more complex technical tax matters. But the PwC team wasn’t done innovating. As a result of US tax reform, the Tax team also faced some complex technical matters related to uncertain tax positions (UTP). The client had spent months creating a file detailing the multiple, intertwined UTP positions. Once again, the PwC team leveraged the Digital Accelerators in their work to create a workflow to recompute the various scenarios considered in the UTP analysis which allowed the team to do the work in a tenth of the time while maintaining a high-level of audit quality. Additionally, in future periods this workflow will be able to be leveraged to assess the tax accounting impact of UTP settlements or other indirect impacts on the transition tax.

Private Company Services (PCS) became the first within Assurance to access the Digital Lab back in August of 2018. At that time, Digital Lab launched with only 20 managed Assurance-specific digital assets. Over time, it began to amass more and more automations -- today it has grown to over 600. This made sifting through the vast number of digital assets time consuming. Recognizing Digital Lab’s ability to make a difference for our people and teams through the powerful solutions shared on the site, a group of five PCS Assurance Digital Accelerators decided to compartmentalize the experience and make the audit-specific automations both accessible and explorable -- and created the PCS Audit Map, a comprehensive Digital Lab ‘Collection’. The team worked closely with a Digital Lab team to learn how to build the PCS Audit Map and make it as user-friendly as possible. The team also collaborated with Auditing Services, Methods and Tools (ASM&amp;T) to ensure the Audit Map is aligned with PwC policy and methodology. This PCS Audit Map launched in July and currently contains over 200 automations. Much like the Digital Lab, new automations are constantly being added so they’ll periodically reevaluate the content that they’ve curated to confirm they’re leveraging the best solutions Digital Lab has to offer. The delivery map is already being used to assist in PCS audits and has received great feedback, and the team is promoting it across the practice. To date, as part of the PCS Digital Roadshow, they’ve visited over 30 offices across the firm with plans to visit more in the coming weeks. Paul Sheward - the Assurance Digital Lab lead partner commented “We believe that there are significant benefits for our Assurance professionals from using Collections - and we will have many more available to the practice in the coming months. The PCS Audit Map has set the bar!” See this team’s work in action and check out the PCS Audit Map in the Digital Lab today!

Since then, our two recent Autom-a-thons have sparked ideas for dozens of automations that will save you and the firm thousands of hours while maintaining audit quality. What’s an ‘Autom-a-thon’? These are half-day hackathons where teams work together to come up with automation ideas and minimal viable products (MVP). PwCers on the Washington Metro Advisory council wanted to be part of the digital revolution after they attended the Digital Academy, but wanted to practice their skills. So they came together to host the first digital hackathon in the McLean office. Teams came together to ideate with the support of Digital Accelerators, and at the end of four hours, the eight teams had eight unique automation ideas to help our firm operate more efficiently. With five of these ideas on the way to being uploaded to Digital Lab, and a potential 620+ hours saved with the collective one-time use of these automations, other markets took notice. It was so successful that the Mid-Atlantic market council strategically decided to take the Autom-a-thon idea to Philadelphia and try it as a One Firm event. The Washington Metro staff Advisory council team went on the road and coached some Philadelphia staff council members and Digital Accelerators through the Autom-a-thon. Creating connectivity across the firm, the Philly event was open to all LoS, staff levels, and technical skill levels -- and those that had an idea they didn’t know how to build, those that wanted to try to build for the first time, those that want to build more but don’t have the dedicated time. Philadelphia-based partners served as first round judges with USLT members serving as the final round judges. The nine unique automations proposed would not only improve our value proposition to our clients and increase firm productivity, but could potentially save about 14,000 self-reported hours with collective use across the firm. The top three team pitches were: Autovengers (Members: Associates Girum Idiris and Taylor Leonard) -- Every single one of us has had to go through firm onboarding. Let’s build a suite of bots that help with these universal onboarding activities, like setting up direct deposit, requesting an AmEx, etc., to take out countless manual, non-engagement hours. Scrubs (Members: Associate Ellis Driscoll and senior associate Jay Rodriguez) -- Scrubbing out client data and sensitive information from assets for uploading to Digital Lab or sharing can be time-consuming, by automating this process we can save 2-6 hours per asset. Need a name bot (Members: Associate Chris Kersey and intern Alex Dean) -- When introduced to a new engagement or statement of work (SOW), we need to start leveraging what is on Digital Lab at the onset. This bot will search your SOW for keywords to input into Digital Lab to deliver recommended assets for you. Tim said it himself, “Folks - you amazed me and inspired me - wow!!! Thank you for making Your Tomorrow real!!! Keep on automating!!” What can I do?

The goal was for Google, which had previously relied heavily on spreadsheets, to be able to manage their enormous volume of data more easily and efficiently. Our PwC Tax team helped the Google tax team move from simple journal entry automation to automating some of their most complex processes around forecasting, tax account reconciliations and tax reform. Various data wrangling tools, including internal Google tools, were employed, giving our PwC team the opportunity to gain new digital knowledge from the client as well. “While we had experience with certain self service data automation tools going in,” said PwC Tax Manager Aaron Lan, “I enjoy learning how to use new tools because they make you better equipped to use the next one that comes out. And as you go along, you can dig deeper into what each tool can do.” After the PwC team showed the Google team the value of moving away from manual spreadsheets, the team introduced Google to data visualizations so they could derive new insights from the data. Teaming as One Firm In addition to PwC’s Tax team, there are PwC Risk Assurance and Advisory teams also on site at Google. Sitting in close proximity makes it only natural that the teams get to know each other and learn the Google tech space together. And they’re bringing our One Firm strategy to life by piloting a One Firm team to look at automation opportunities across our delivery model.

You’ll take a deep dive into our strategic priorities — including quality and citizen-led innovation — as you learn more about the existing tools and technologies you can use to further enhance quality and tech-enable your audit. The event series kicked off on June 4 in Kansas City. We caught up with Lead Planner, Manager Garett Brown, to hear about how the inaugural Your Tomorrow Live! went. “The event was great! It was very interactive, allowing for a lot of attendee participation with presenters both on stage and in the expo. Attendees got to see how the new digital tools actually work through live demonstrations and real life assurance examples.” Lead Planner for the Dallas FS meeting, Director Matthew Schwatz, agreed. “Your Tomorrow Live! was a great event. It was high energy and very interactive. Seeing live demonstrations of some of the new tools and technology that we’ll be implementing should have everyone in Assurance excited for what the future has in store.” Their advice on why you should attend? “It’s an immersive experience you don’t ordinarily get to share with your colleagues. You get to watch our strategy come to life in a fun way.” And the proof is in the photos. Your Tomorrow Live! is rolling out to core assurance and process assurance teams in markets nationwide over ten weeks, from June through early August.

Are you ready? Phoenix goes live in just 3 days. Are you ready? Assurance Aug. 9, 2019 Next week brings a new opportunity to standardize and simplify the way you work. On Monday, August 12, engagement teams can work even smarter and more efficiently with Phoenix, PwC’s workflow platform. Phoenix replaces Envoy and enhances the way we engage with our Acceleration Centers (ACs) and Centers of Excellence (COEs). It’s just one of the ways we're digitizing our business to enhance quality and increase productivity as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy in Assurance. Now, here’s what you should do to make sure your team is prepared to begin using this new platform. Link your active and archived prior year Aura databases to your Phoenix profile. This linkage is critical for the automated process of granting AC and CoE staff assigned to your engagements access to your Aura databases. Add your AC (formerly, GDM) and COE WBS codes to your Phoenix profile. Important reminder: You will no longer be able to initiate requests in Envoy effective August 12*. All reservations and requests with due dates on or after September 1 have been moved to Phoenix**. Your requests with due dates on or prior to August 31 will still be delivered in Envoy. If the reservations or requests did not move over to Phoenix as you expected, first contact your AC team members. If they are unable to resolve your questions, you can contact ac.delivery.operations@us.pwc.com. *Exceptions to the August deployment include Risk Assurance service categories relating to the RA Tech tool support services and the DRS - Journal Entry analysis for audit support. These service offerings will be available in Phoenix subsequent to the September release. **You may begin to receive auto-generated notifications from Phoenix for reservations and requests moved to Phoenix on your behalf; there is no action required by you in response to these notifications. Still have questions? You can refer to Phoenix Guidance and find more information on the Phoenix Spark page. Technical questions should be directed to PwC Help. As we continue to reimagine the possible and explore new ways to tech-enable the audit, look for new enhancements to the tool throughout the course of the next year.

I’m truly honored to succeed Maria in the role of Assurance leader and to have the opportunity to work with you all. Thanks to your hard work, we’ve made a lot of progress, and you should all be very proud. We have expanded our use of technology and our digital skills, while growing our business through our focus on providing quality audits. I’m excited to build on this momentum in FY20, and I plan to spend time in these early months listening and connecting with our teams and clients. I know PwC, and yet I am coming in fresh to this role. Here’s a little about me: I’m a PwC boomerang, a dad of three, and a native of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. A former PwC Assurance partner, I served as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chief Accountant beginning in 2016. This is a great firm and a first-rate practice, and I’m thrilled to be back! I believe passionately in the role we play as a purpose-driven organization in the capital markets, adding trust in the financial reporting system and contributing to the strength of organizations and our economies. My goal is to help us maintain our positive momentum, and to keep our Assurance practice strong and relevant. I look forward to working together to execute our firmwide strategy, and I’ll be in touch soon!

Our new Methodology minute series is part of a broader initiative that supports our One Firm goal of becoming the most relevant Assurance practice by further supporting our teams in the execution of quality, independent audits -- the foundation of our strategy. And it also supports our efforts to tech-enable the audit as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy by enabling our engagement teams to work more seamlessly through new digital solutions.

Check out the TEA Tool Finder to see if Revenue Insights is right for you. -------------------------- Enhanced Central Entity Service (CES) and Authorization for Service (AFS) — our tools to manage restricted clients and authorize services we provide them — launch later this summer.

To reflect these changes, our SDCs will now be called Acceleration Centers (AC) as previously announced. The goal: to further enhance quality through standardization, drive consistency in execution, and enable a more tech-enabled experience for our teams and clients. It’s a key part of how we’re accelerating our future in Assurance. Here are 3 ways this change can help your teams: AC resources will now be eligible to mark EGAs as prepared and reviewed in certain situations. Final review remains with the engagement team or CoE. Certain activities the AC resources can perform to support substantive testing have been enhanced to reflect tasks requiring no more than a limited level of professional judgment. Certain operational protocols for use of the ACs have been simplified. For more information and to start accelerating our future, watch this brief video, consult Audit Advisor 19/13, and read the Acceleration Center guide for engagement teams and CoEs available on the Acceleration Center Strategy US Assurance Spark page. Note: There is no change to the Remote Team Member (RTM) model for certain PCS and ECS engagements.

Engagement teams will use Phoenix to request, receive and manage resources and services from our Acceleration Centers (ACs), which can now help your teams in 3 new ways. Phoenix replaces Envoy, which we’ll sunset later this year. This tool represents just one more way we’re tech-enabling the audit and digitizing our business as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Important: Take action to prepare to transition to Phoenix Until July 26, continue to use GEM to create new engagement profiles and complete your AC Checklist. GEM is integrated with Phoenix so all engagement profiles created in GEM will be accessible in Phoenix. Starting right away, once your engagement profile is visible in Phoenix, link your active and archived prior year Aura databases to the Phoenix profile. Here is how. This linkage is critical for the process of granting AC and COE users access to the databases. Between August 5-12, all in-process requests and reservations entered into Envoy will be transferred to Phoenix for you. If you won’t need support of the ACs prior to August 12, we recommend waiting until Phoenix goes live to make new reservations. Visit our Phoenix site for a wealth of support tools, training and resources, including detailed instructions for getting started.

The Human Resources Shared Services Center’s (HR SSC) new Deployment Enablement Team (DET) now has responsibility for specific deployment activities, in collaboration with the LoS deployment teams. What does this mean for me? The DET supports our LoS deployment teams to schedule staff for projects, in line with our utilization and revenue goals. Your TalentLink and T&amp;E schedules (personal and for your engagements) are key to making this work, so it’s important to keep them up-to-date. The DET, which will work as an extension of the LoS deployment teams you work with today, will reach out directly to you for time that was not captured in GFS, variances between TalentLink and GFS, and staffing confirmations. What you need to do: Respond to these requests as needed. The DET will also approve/update your TalentLink booking requests. What you need to do: Continue to use the appropriate tools for requesting updates to your TalentLink schedule (see details in LoS sections below); you may risk rejection if your schedule isn't current. The DET will process all requests within 24 hours and work closely with LoS Deployment Consultants on required actions. (Note: Delays may occur during the first few weeks of transition.) As part of our overall simplification efforts, we have greatly reduced our list of non-chargeable TalentLink Job Names xLoS. What you need to do (Assr &amp; Tax only): Immediately begin using this new list of non-chargeable job names. Note: This file has been updated; please review for the most up-to-date listings and guidance. Each LoS team is in a different place in this optimization journey; please click here for LoS details. This is an important step in our One Firm journey and providing opportunities and streamlined scheduling for you.

Only you can affix your electronic signature. You may not give your electronic signature to anyone else. 2. Only sign final documents - do not put your electronic signature on draft documents. 3. When using your ePen you must "flatten" and secure your electronic signature after you affix it to a document to prevent anyone else from being able to easily copy it. The Tax Policy: Signatures and Alternative Signature Methods specifies that electronic signatures can be used, however signers must personally affix their signature. Signers using alternative signature methods remain responsible for the quality and correctness of the document being signed. The policy also provides that you must follow the prescribed processes for preventing the electronic signature from being altered, copied, or edited. This means when using your ePen you must "flatten" and secure the document. The instructions are in the Quick Reference Guide: ePen for Tax - Adobe Acrobat XI Professional. Finally, if you encounter an electronic signature that is not flattened, then (a) delete it, and/or (b) send it to signer for inspection, based upon what makes sense under the circumstances.

Mapper leverages machine learning to map the client’s trial balance data to PwC standard taxonomies. What can take weeks in Excel takes a matter of minutes in Mapper. Mapper leverages the Account Description, Account Type and Natural Balance from the Client’s chart of accounts to present a suggestion on the PwC standard taxonomy that best matches the account. If you previously mapped your client’s accounts to tax forms, Mapper includes a utility you can use to convert those mappings to the PwC standard taxonomy. What is Tax Adjustments? Tax Adjustments is an application that significantly streamlines the calculation of 80+ common book/tax adjustments by seamlessly integrating the exported data from Mapper. In a matter of minutes, each entity whose data is imported from Mapper will have an initial calculation of taxable income and what the tax return will look like. Users can then apply manual updates to refine taxable income as well as review and sign off on each workpaper. Tax Adjustments includes reports that allow users to review a “walk across” presentation from book balances all the way to tax form amounts.

They can be a powerful tool to share our perspective on the world around us, including all the reasons we’re proud to be part of PwC. But just like the old adage “measure twice, cut once,” taking an extra moment to think about your social media activity, as well as other communications you make publicly, can make all the difference to your personal brand. PwC’s updated public communications and social media policy is now available to help you navigate the tricky waters of social media and external communications. The policy includes: A new, consolidated format that is both accessible and comprehensive Guidance for speaking in public, publishing on our websites and engaging in social media Insight into the impact that our personal communications may have on firm business Internal processes and points of contact for circumstances requiring approvals We often talk about leveraging the power of our differences as part of what makes us #PwCProud, and that extends to who we are outside of the firm. Each of us has diverse skills, experience and judgement. Just as we do in all our work, it’s important that we exercise good judgement externally, and make considered decisions when communicating publicly.

It is a general principle that taxpayers have a right to manage their tax affairs provided they act within the law. Equally they should also be able to access independent advice on their tax position. However, the global nature of the business world together with the complexity and competing priorities of national laws, including tax competition amongst nations, is such that it is not always clear where lines should be drawn. The Global Tax Code of Conduct covers the conduct of the member firms, who they should act for, and how they should act. Read the Global Tax Code of Conduct at this link.

With Critical Audit Matter reporting on the horizon, the timing for this refresh couldn’t be better. Click here to watch a short video on the new audit committee report templates. This roll-out, part of our efforts to simplify and standardize our work and digitize our client communications, will take place in three phases: After reviewing audit committee reports across several of our PCAOB clients and talking to GEPs across all sectors, in Phase 1 we have rebranded our templates for audits conducted under PCAOB standards, expanded content to include our commitment to provide insights from the audit and trending topics, and created a best practice example for audit plan communications. The new templates include a presentation style executive summary along with summarized trending topics covering accounting and regulatory topics, corporate governance insights and select sectors. They are now available in U.S. Template Manager. We strongly encourage teams to use the new templates. Phase 2 will include rebranded templates for audits conducted under AICPA standards with best practice examples. In addition, best practice examples for quarterly reviews, interim results and completion reports for audits conducted under PCAOB standards will be available in early spring. Phase 3 will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018 and will include tech-enabled report creation. In addition, the library of trending topics will include all sectors and LOS, consistent with our One Firm strategy. The tool will also facilitate rollforward of reports in subsequent years. We strongly encourage the use of these new templates. The feedback has been extremely positive. Some of the benefits include: Facilitate the focus by the audit committees on the most important aspects of our audit and the value we bring Easier delivery of the presentation at the audit committee meeting More consistent experience across our client base, with a branded modern look and feel Supports creation of the documents quickly and efficiently To access the new templates directly, refer to U.S. Template Manager here. The templates can also be accessed from the ASM&amp;T Spark Page here.

Accessing map via a browser (Chrome, Internet Explorer) is a great way to create a more seamless experience between map and other working environments including Google Apps and SharePoint. Here are some simple solutions that can help you get the most out of your map experience when working in your Internet browser. I’d like to... Solution in place Open a map file in a browser The quickest way to open map files in your browser is to open map Portfolio in your browser (pro tip: bookmark it!) and then open your map file. If you are viewing your map file in Lotus Notes, you can open the file in a browser by clicking on “Open in a Browser” under the “Information” tab. Copy emails from my PwC Google Mail account into my map file Install and use the “Gmail - Copy to map File” app from the PwC Chrome Store, which is accessible by selecting the PwC icon in the top right of your Chrome browser. You may also click on this link to launch the app directly. Copy a Google Doc/Sheet/Slide from Google Drive to my map file Open your Google Drive, then right click on the document that you would like to copy into your map file. Hover over the “Open with” and select “Copy to map file” then choose your map file. Additional tips and tricks: Deploy a map file: Click here to launch a short video on how to deploy a map file. Note: Be sure to deploy your map file from the appropriate map Portfolio: Advisory, Transaction Services, Risk Assurance, Public Sector. You should fully open the map file via a browser or Lotus Notes upon receipt of the confirmation email from TeamFind. Change your map file information: You can make updates to the file name and engagement team members under the “Activities” drop down menu on the top right corner of any map file. For other administrative updates, such as adding or changing WBS codes, click on “Open TeamFind Profile” also under “Activities.” Avoid the use of special characters in document, attachment or folder names: Issues with opening attachments or finding documents in map files have been linked to the use of special characters, such as +, %, #, and @. Using map Explorer: map Explorer lets you add, open, save and edit documents directly in your map files without needing to navigate to the specific map file first – in the same way that you would use Windows Explorer to navigate your laptop hard drives. Look for the icon below on your desktop. Note: In order to effectively use map Explorer, you need to ensure that your Lotus Notes password settings are configured correctly or you will be prompted to enter your password. Visit the Advisory R&amp;Q Roadmap: Working with a map file page for additional guidance. Wrapping up a map file: Be sure to wrap up and close your map file no later than 90 days after you complete your engagement. To wrap up the file, click on the "Wrap-up File" link in the “Activities” menu. A map wizard will launch to guide you through the process. Deleting a map file: You may need to delete a map file if your engagement never started, you accidentally created duplicate map files or you launched a map file from the wrong portfolio. To delete the map file, click "Access/File Management" and then click "Delete Database." Deletions are subject to approval by Line of Service (LOS) R&amp;Q. Note: If your engagement started but did not complete, you should wrap up the file using the “Abandoned” option for file status. Questions or more information For more detailed descriptions of these solutions, visit the map Spark page, contact your LOS R&amp;Q team or open map Help (by clicking on “Help &amp; Links” at the top right of your file page).

How do you want your new iPhone -- fancy or fancy-schmancy? PwC Technology Oct. 12, 2017 By now, you’ve probably heard all about Apple’s annual keynote and the dramatic unveiling of not one, but two shiny new iPhone models: iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Pre-order for the iPhone 8 began Friday Oct 15, and the iPhone X begins Oct. 27. If you’re going to devote your heart (and cash) to a new device, you need the facts. We hosted a Webex to answer as many questions as we could -- you can view the recording here. We’re still sorting out some complicated questions, but here’s what we know now. When should I upgrade to iOS11? OK, this isn’t your top question -- but we need to get it out of the way: Even though iOS11 was released Sept. 19, we recommend you wait 2-3 weeks to upgrade. This allows developers (including PwC) to make updates so apps work well. Watch PwC Inside -- we’ll let you know when it’s OK to update. I’m eligible for a device upgrade. How much do the various new iPhones cost? Below are the costs for those eligible for an upgrade: iPhone Model Retail Price AT&amp;T Upgrade Verizon Upgrade T-Mobile Upgrade Sprint Upgrade iPhone 8 64 GB $699 $49.99 $49.99 $49.99 Free iPhone 8 256 GB $849 $199.99 $199.99 $199.99 $100.00 iPhone 8 Plus 64 GB $799 $149.99 $149.99 $149.99 $50.00 iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB $949 $299.99 $299.99 $299.99 $200.00 iPhone X 64 GB $999 $349.99 $349.99 $349.99 $250.00 iPhone X 256 GB $1,149 $499.99 $499.99 $499.99 $400.00 This is my first device with this carrier. Do I get a price break? If this is the first smartphone on a new contract through PwC, subsidized pricing is significantly reduced from full retail price: iPhone Model Retail Price New acct - AT&amp;T New acct - Verizon New acct - T-Mobile New acct - Sprint iPhone 8 64 GB $699 Free Free Free Free iPhone 8 256 GB $849 $99.99 $99.99 $99.99 $100.00 iPhone 8 Plus 64 GB $799 $49.99 $49.99 $49.99 $50.00 iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB $949 $199.99 $199.99 $199.99 $200.00 iPhone X 64 GB $999 $249.99 $249.99 $249.99 $250.00 iPhone X 256 GB $1,149 $399.99 $399.99 $399.99 $400.00 Prices are subject to change; the eMobility Portal always has the most current pricing. I’m ready to commit! How do I pre-order that sweet, sweet iPhone 8? Access the eMobility Portal and see the Assets box. In the Upgrade Eligible/Date column, you’ll see either “Upgrade now” or your future eligibility date. (Only smartphones are eligible.) If you’re eligible, select Upgrade Now and follow the prompts (more info here if you need it). How long will it take my iPhone to arrive? Pre-order for the iPhone 8 began on Sept. 15, shipping Sept. 22. Pre-order for the iPhone X begins Oct. 27, shipping Nov. 3. Orders are processed as of the pre-order date/time, and they’re fulfilled in the order received. However, popular devices like these can take 4-8 weeks to arrive. Even if you order immediately there could be shipping delays -- it all depends on your carrier’s inventory. Watch the eMobility portal for tracking info (IT won’t have further details). Pro tips: Any billing issues will delay your order. Your personal credit card will be charged once the device is ready to ship, so be sure to use a card that won’t expire in the next few months. Make sure your billing address matches your credit card address. Gift cards cannot be used for payment. If I upgraded within the last 20 months, can I buy an iPhone 8 for PwC’s subsidized price and pay the difference? No, you only receive subsidized pricing through PwC when you’re eligible for an upgrade. You can purchase a device prior to your upgrade date, but you’d pay full retail cost. Can I line up at the Apple store and buy one? Technically, you can purchase a phone at any time. But if you purchase from Apple or another retailer, you won’t receive PwC-subsidized pricing (even if you’re eligible). Can I add an Apple Watch to my PwC plan? We’re still assessing this. We suggest waiting for now -- please see these considerations before pre-ordering. Got another question? We have a thread going on Spark -- post it there, and we’ll reply ASAP.

We hope you’ll take full advantage of this opportunity to disconnect from your work technology. IT Customer Support is still here to help if you need it. While local IT Customer Support is closed, you can use our other support options or visit PwC’s new service hub. It's an easy way to search for answers to your question, place orders, make support requests, resolve issues and find support options for IT, human capital, finance and other internal support services. Submit your time and expenses by June 29 to avoid delinquency notices, errors or expense/AmEx issues. Submit any lingering invoices to avoid delays in payment. Add this calendar reminder to double-check you’ve cleared your AmEx buffer and submitted all expenses in the legacy Mobile Expense system before we switch to the new expense system on July 17. Set your out-of-office notification. (Tip: Download the updated Out of Office app from PwC’s App Store … setting up your out-of-office alerts has never been so easy!) Enable call forwarding if you expect to receive critical calls. Traveling abroad? Your phone already has international roaming -- please use it responsibly. Don’t forget your passwords. But if you do, you can easily reset them. Replicate Aura data to avoid data loss or replication issues. Power down your PC. Not only is it time to check out, but when you turn it on, the proper updates will automatically install -- and you can hit the ground running when you come back to work. Clear your workspace. Put away files, and secure or take your laptop home.

This is when we look back at how far we’ve come this year and celebrate the accomplishments that brought us here. Because our business is strong, we have confirmed an overall 10% increase in the bonus pool. And, next week, you'll receive your $1,000 Be well bonus in your pay. The purpose of the bonus pool is to provide meaningful rewards that are aligned with business performance. The 10% uplift doesn’t mean individual bonuses will necessarily increase by 10%. Of course, the most important thing is what the uplift means for your personal situation. That’s not a question we can answer yet.Just as in past years, we make bonus decisions through the CRT process so we can look at each person’s performance and impact -- and set that against the bigger picture of how the business and their peer group performed. A lot of time and care goes into this process -- and you’ll hear the results in June when Career Outlook conversations take place between June 13 and July 12. In the meantime, I hope you'll enjoy your Be well bonus. Remember to share -- either on social media using #Bewellworkwell or via email -- how you plan to spend your bonus to boost one of the four dimensions of energy, so that it may inspire others. It’s been a lot of fun to hear your plans for the bonus. Whatever you choose, we hope you’ll invest in yourself, just as we are investing in you!

The IRS opened the preparer tax identification number (PTIN) system for 2019 renewals Monday, October 22nd. It is our understanding the IRS sent out renewal notices to all PTIN holders indicating that the 2019 PTIN renewal period is now underway. All tax professionals should have also received notification from the firm of a My Compliance Dashboard entry regarding their 2019 PTIN requirement on October 23, 2018. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN and updating your status in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database, you will be required to complete your My Compliance Dashboard PTIN requirement by the due date. As a reminder, the PTIN requirement is a three-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or approved exemption) in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database Complete your PTIN Confirmation requirement on your Compliance Dashboard The PTIN Requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2018 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2018 PTIN before you can renew for 2019. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2018 calendar year. The firm requires all personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must create an entry in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit. NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update your status in the database accordingly. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202)346-5219 or Mike McDermott at (949)437-5413.

What you should do Access to client and firm confidential information should be limited to only those individuals that have a "need to know". The risk to the firm and our people is real and we count on your vigilance to help mitigate those risks by: • Discussing individual data access needs and data collection procedures during engagement kickoff meetings or at the beginning of engagement performance. Grant access on a "need to know" basis only. • Specifying with the client the data elements needed for the work to be performed and collect only the minimum information necessary. • Establishing data collection procedures and agree on the encryption method to be used – be sensitive to data when it travels. • Reviewing the data when received and return or request the removal of extraneous data. • Securing information when not actively in use (i.e., at the end of the day or while in transit) – e.g., keep hard copies in locked cabinets or locked firm issued devices. Non-public information should not be shared Keep in mind that disclosing or discussing confidential client information or firm private matters with friends, family, or coworkers (without a need to know) whether in person or through forms such as blogs, discussion groups, external or instant messaging services or social media sites can provide clues to non-public information that may harm both the firm and you. Questions? Contact a member of the Tax Q&amp;RM team or visit the Q&amp;RM Home page on Tax Source for additional information on Tax Data Security, Confidentiality and Your Responsibility.

Their advice was, “Make sure everyone knows why this matters to us and our careers.” The bottom line is our strategy and the strength of our business matter to all of us — from the opportunities we have, to our ability to reward you for your contributions. Our business is strong — and that’s a good place to be. That means we have the financial capacity to reward your good work and invest in our firm’s future through Your Tomorrow. We had a good year in FY18, and that trend continues in FY19. Firmwide revenues of $3.6 billion are slightly ahead of budget, and profitability is tracking well for the first quarter. We have a plan for FY19. This year we’re going to turn up the dial on Your Tomorrow and execute on our goal to make PwC a truly digital organization. We're changing our firm to serve our clients even better and to secure our future. Nearly every type of business is going digital. That means that as we lean in and learn how to use technology to work differently, we put ourselves in position to be in demand for the long term (just like our firm). Read my FY19 strategy letter.

The Q&amp;RM self-study series is required for Associates, Senior Associates and Managers and should be completed the earlier of 12 months of the courses being posted to your Vantage Need to Do Tile or promotion to the next staff class. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the Q&amp;RM expectation is for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility. Completion requirements: Q&amp;RM series training should be completed within the timeframe specified. Promotions to the next staff level carry a Q&amp;RM training completion requirement in FY18, similar to the annual CPE requirement. The required courses for your staff level can be accessed in Vantage: Manager Courses: 1 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 1 - Targeting a Client. 2 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 2 - Engaging the Client. 3 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 3 - Analyzing Independence. 4 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 4 - Negotiating the Contract. 5 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 5 - Performing the Engagement. * - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Documentation Training * - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR).

Flight delayed? Use the time to earn CPEs Meeting canceled? Flight delayed? Use the time to earn CPEs Ethics &amp; Compliance Oct. 18, 2018 When you unexpectedly find time in your day, take the opportunity to learn something new and earn CPE credits. The deadline to meet firm CPE requirements is June 30, and taking advantage of downtime now will help you avoid the last-minute rush to be in compliance with this critical professional requirement. You’ll also be able to put what you learned into practice sooner with your clients and make an even greater impact. Here are some tips: Check credits needed: Access your Learner Compliance Summary in Vantage. Where your report shows “PwC US Firm CPE Policy,” click “View compliance report” and check the “Credits Needed” column to see how many CPEs you need to earn. This Quick Reference Card explains how. Make a plan: Use the LoS learning resources in Vantage to map out your plan for earning CPEs. Click on the “Need CPE” tile to search for content that makes the most sense for your development. And now your search is even easier -- just sort and filter. Add to calendar: To stay on track, add one or more of these reminders to your Google calendar for the last week of March, April and May. (For Lotus Notes, manually copy and paste this information into your calendar.) Submit external courses for credit: You may want to see if you can get CPE credit for external courses or conferences you’ve attended. Here’s how. Are you exempt? CPE requirements apply to almost all partners and client service staff -- both CPAs and non-CPAs. But if you believe you should be exempt from the firm’s CPE requirements, reach out now to the CPE Compliance team. Need help? Follow CPE Compliance on Spark to learn more about your CPE requirements, including how the 120-hour rolling requirement works and how we determine if you are subject to the audit/attest CPE policy. If you have any questions about your CPE responsibilities, please email us at CPE.Compliance@us.pwc.com.

Phishing, cyberthreats and malicious links, oh my! Network Information Security Oct. 31, 2017 October is just about over, and we’ve been talking a lot about continuous improvement in keeping PwC’s information safe. So what’s next? How can you continue to boost your security awareness so you can help protect the firm, our clients, and your own personal data? First, let’s recap the key security tips we’ve explored this month -- and how you can make a difference: Make sure the websites you visit are secure and legitimate (full article). Don’t click on suspicious links or attachments, and report them right away to us.phish.reporting@pwc.com (full article). Use the Information Protection Principles and Engagement Lifecycle Checklist to help strengthen your digital acumen and guide you when collecting, transferring or exchanging data (full article). Follow the Secure Workspace Policy so you can protect confidential firm and client information wherever you work -- in the office or remotely (full article). Our phishing IQ doubled! We run continuous tests to help the firm improve on our ability to recognize phishing emails -- the No. 1 way cybercriminals try to infiltrate organizations like PwC. Our latest phishing simulation was an email about an invoice ready for signature. Remember that one? Only 15% of you clicked on the “malicious” link in the email, compared to over 30% in the last phishing simulation of a similar nature. That’s a 50% drop! On top of that, more than 4,000 staff reported the email to us.phish.reporting@pwc.com for a chance to win our Phish Reporting Challenge. Great job. Even with the most sophisticated spam filters, real phishing attacks still get through to employee inboxes. It just takes one person clicking on a malicious link or file attachment in an email to spread malware -- such as ransomware or spyware -- across the entire network! To learn more, watch these quick videos on how phishing works and how it can affect the firm. How can you learn more?

In a recent phishing drill, fewer than 1% of PwCers clicked on a suspicious link in an “Account security alert” email. And only a fraction shared credentials on the linked webpage. So hats off to you! But we still need to keep our guard up. That’s why we run periodic phishing simulations -- to foster a security-conscious culture and raise awareness of real phishing schemes. Report that phish! Spotting a phish is important, but it’s imperative that you also report potential attacks. Based on our tests, only 1 in 10 partners and staff report potential phishing attacks. When you report a suspicious email to GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com, our team can investigate right away and -- if it’s a real attack -- protect other inboxes across our network. Winner winner, phish dinner Remember: When you report a suspicious email, you’re automatically entered into our Phish Reporting Challenge to win a $100 Amazon gift card. To report, simply email GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com (see contest rules). To see the common signs of phishing, check out this quick reference card.

For the fourth quarter, we’ll continue with our re-prioritized scheduled learning opportunities that support digital training through Your Tomorrow and supplement them with additional learning opportunities. Our main priorities are for remaining Advisory Staff to complete the Digital Academy training as soon as possible, for all staff to complete the four Digital Quests and encourage those that can to attend BXT training. Here are more details for all partners and staff: Digital Academy If you are below partner and have not yet attended, sign up for the Digital Academy! Our goal in Advisory was to have everyone below partner level attend a session by March 31. We made great progress and now want the rest of Advisory staff to get this completed as soon as possible. Remember that if you’re unable to attend the Digital Academy in your home market due to business travel, you can sign up for a session in your client location. It is extremely important to complete the pre-work PRIOR to attending your Digital Academy session. Plan for 45 minutes to install software and download data sets. (See your pre-work email for more information.) Digital Quests Complete the four Digital Quests, our industry-based online learning simulations designed to check your digital awareness. Remember, we must all complete the four Digital Quests before June 30 to earn a Digital Acumen knowledge badge. And remember, for our firm-wide Learn2earn challenge, those who complete the four Digital Quests and earn a minimum of 150 points in Digital Lab by April 30 will have the chance to earn $1,000 in Real-time recognition — one in seven will win! You can access the Digital Quests in the Digital Hub — available on PC or mobile via the Digital Hub app in PwC’s App Store. BXT Training We are encouraging everyone who is able to attend BXT Immersion or Incubator sessions during the fourth quarter. If you are interested in attending a BXT training, and you have not received an invite for a session in your market (these are sent about a month in advance of the session), please contactBXT.team@pwc.com. Here is the current schedule: BXT Immersions BXT Incubators Want to change the way we work with clients? Bring your ideas and use BXT to test and prototype over the course of 6 hours. March 29 - NYC Half day session to apply BXT to client opportunities and engagement in your home and client market April 5 - SF / Bay area April 12 - Boston May 3 - Chicago April 12 - Minneapolis April 19 - Detroit June 14 - Wash DC April 26 - Philadelphia July 12 - NYC May 17 - Boston June 7 - Chicago Integrated Solutions: What do you know about our Integrated Solutions? All Advisory partners and staff should complete the overview self-study, “Integrated Solutions: Working Together to Sell Bigger, Deliver Better.” Check out the Integrated Solutions Learning Hub where you can discover more! Also: See the list of upcoming Advisory learning opportunities for April through mid-May. Associates and managers: Take a look at our recently-added x-Advisory Development Hub for Associates and x-Advisory Development Hub for Managers. The manager hub was developed to help structure and guide current managers’ professional development activities while preparing them to become stronger candidates for director. It’s especially helpful for experienced hires who recently joined PwC. Additional hubs for senior associates and directors will launch later this year. Don’t miss out on enrollment for in-person courses. Take note of the start date. Consider ways to Reinvest in the firm. For example, participate as an instructor in future courses. For more information, see the L&amp;D for Advisory Reinvest Self-Nomination tool. Explore Vantage to identify and register for other development opportunities. You can also use Vantage to find short, informative content to get quick knowledge on topics important to clients.

You want to be able to read things quickly while you’re on the go, and access the details later if you need more information. In the spirit of the 25% Challenge, we can all do less and accomplish more with a few rules of the road for communicating within PwC: Aim to keep email text to 1,000 characters or fewer, and include a link to access all the gory details (e.g., link to a Google doc or Spark page). Don’t bury the lead. Within 30 seconds of reading, the reader should know why you’ve emailed. No “me too” emails repeating what someone else already has communicated to the same group of people. (As a reader, pay attention and don’t expect to receive multiple reminders, as you have in the past.) Think twice before you “reply to all” -- does everyone really need to receive your email?

It will be pushed to your PC on Friday. At the same time, we’ll delete classic Hangouts from your PC. Still want classic Hangouts? Visit chrome://extensions to download it again -- but remember, you won’t see group conversations between platforms. Chances are, classic Hangouts may go away someday soon, so why not make the switch? Not just for desktop -- PwC’s App Store has the Chat mobile app The Hangouts Chat mobile app has more to offer than the classic Hangouts app. Download Hangouts Chat from PwC’s App Store today and start taking advantage of its superior mobile experience, such as mobile access to Chat Rooms. Speaking of which … Tidy up your “Room” with Google Chat threads A key feature of Google Chat Rooms is the six-month chat history — your team can track important conversations and decisions. But a clean room takes a bit of organization, as discussions move from one topic to another (and then another, and then back to the first). ' However, Chat has a solution! Conversation threads help you ... Track dialogue surrounding decisions and updates. Find what you’re looking for (without all the digging). Get up to speed without being distracted by side conversations. To create a new thread, click the + in the bottom of the Room, and then choose a title. Pro tip: Create subject headers for threads by adding asterisks around the subject line — example: *Agenda for Wednesday call*. You can even use emoji to differentiate your Rooms. Respond by clicking Reply at the end of the thread. To unfollow a thread, click the bell icon in the upper-right corner. Here’s what it looks like in action. Chrome extensions: So long to eight of ’em Chrome extensions take up space and resources on your PC, so we periodically simplify.

Engagement teams should normally begin the client acceptance process well before the first engagement is won for a prospective client. Not only will this allow for the completion of the client acceptance process before an engagement acceptance decision is required, but completing the process early in the pursuit process will avoid an investment of time in a prospective client that does not meet our client acceptance standards. In certain limited circumstances, engagement teams may need to begin work on an engagement before the client acceptance process is fully completed. In such situations, it may be appropriate for the engagement team to request an accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance exception via the GFS Risk Management Exception process (“conditional request”). Once obtained, an approved conditional request enables the engagement team to issue an engagement letter and obtain a charge code prior to the completion of full client acceptance. An approved conditional request does not replace or serve as a substitute for the firm's full client acceptance process. Accordingly, the conditional request process is used only in specific, limited circumstances. Moreover, even where conditional request is provided, the engagement team must complete the full client acceptance process immediately following receipt of a conditional request. &gt;&gt;&gt; The current client acceptance process, in which Salesforce is the system of record for client acceptance status rather than the A&amp;C system, can take as little as three days when no adverse data is found. Teams should submit an ADS request as soon as a prospective client is created in Salesforce. In most cases, the prospective client will be accepted in Salesforce by the time the entity is validated and added to the A&amp;C system. &lt;&lt;&lt; An accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance can be obtained by submitting a conditional request for a "New Client Entity" (not a "New Engagement/WBS Code") through the GFS Risk Management Exception Code Release Database (click here). A link to the database can also be found in the Quick Links on the Acceptance and Continuance Homepage. Conditional requests will be considered only when the following criteria are met: · The engagement team establishes that it needs to start work immediately due to a time-sensitive opportunity (i.e., the engagement team has won the work and confirmed the deliverable deadline, which does not allow sufficient time for the completion of the standard client acceptance process); · As a result of due diligence conducted by the engagement team, the engagement partner is confident that the results of the ADS performed under the full client acceptance process will not raise any reputational, financial or other concerns that would cause us to decline working for the prospective client; and · The engagement team created the Client and submitted an opportunity in Salesforce and submitted an ADS request. The ADS request should include the appropriate members of prospective client’s management, board members and/or investors/shareholders (e.g., CEO, President, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, VP of Tax/ Director, Chairman of the Board, Audit Committee Chair and/or key investors/shareholders). It is important that the engagement partner be involved in the entire client acceptance process, including the conditional request process. The firm's client acceptance process is a fundamental firm policy and risk management control. The engagement partner is responsible for the proper consideration of all risk management policies and procedures on their engagements. The GFS Exception does not replace the Adverse Data Search and A&amp;C client acceptance assessment process, if required. In general, client acceptance in A&amp;C is required for new, non-audit clients of the US/Mexico firm (generally at the Ultimate Domestic Parent entity level) when: · Adverse data has been identified by the ADS team and you have been instructed to complete a client acceptance assessment in A&amp;C · The prospective client is a foreign entity with no US or Mexico operations (regardless of ADS finding · Your team feels that input from Risk Management or Business Leadership is required to evaluate this new client (regardless of ADS findings) Full client acceptance must be complete in accordance with the instructions provided by the ADS team as soon as possible, and in no event, later than within six weeks of obtaining an approved conditional request. Teams need to perform due diligence and submit supplemental information along with a conditional request to facilitate the expedited, conditional client acceptance evaluation process, which includes responding to the questions listed below. When gathering supplemental information, do not solely rely on the prospective client’s website but rather perform due diligence using resources such as Factiva Google, Google News, Bloomberg, and other reputable tools and share the sources used. The supplemental information includes the following: · Identify the prospective client and briefly describe the related ownership/organizational structure and its business. · Describe the nature and scope of the services to be performed. · Briefly describe PwC's relationships (e.g., lead tax partners, other relevant relationships) with the potential new client, if any. · If the client is referred to us from another PwC member firm, obtain a copy of that member firm's client acceptance or similar information that would be helpful in making the US firm's assessment (e.g., is the prospective client an accepted Assurance, Tax and/or Advisory client of the member firm, how recent was the client acceptance completed by the member firm). · In the event our relationship with the prospective client is limited, perform due diligence on the company, its executives/significant shareholders, directors or the individual client, as appropriate, and provide a copy of the information obtained and the sources from which it was obtained. · Provide list of client’s board members/senior management and link to relevant information regarding such persons. · Identify potential risk factors/basis for your assessment of potential risk factors (e.g., litigation with other service providers, vendors/clients, employees/board members, financing concerns). · Identify potential conflicts of interest. · Document the engagement partner's conclusion as to whether the client should be conditionally accepted as a client, and why. · Identify any reasons to question the integrity of the prospective client, subsidiaries, management team, and shareholders/owners and/or partners. · Provide potential client website link. · Confirm that an ADS has been requested. Important reminders: An approved conditional request DOES NOT replace a Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment requirement. A Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment must be completed in the A&amp;C system for each and every engagement. Resource: Click here to see the "New Client Acceptance Reference Guide - Salesforce".

Certain Google Drive files will be deleted on April 8 — review now PwC Technology April 4, 2019 As part of a targeted data cleanup effort related to sensitive cybersecurity client projects, all Google Drive files that were shared with you and owned by a specific subset of certain former partners and staff will be deleted after Monday, April 8, 2019. You may unknowingly need files owned by one of these former partners and staff members, and we’ve provided a way for you to review and save those files from deletion. Please note that once the Google Drive files are deleted, there will be no way to recover them. To determine if you or your team need any files that are part of this Google Drive cleanup: Open these specially configured links: My Drive and Shared with me. If, like the vast majority of our partners and staff, you don’t see any files, no further action is required. You are done. If you see one or more files listed but you don’t need them, no action is required. You are done. If you see a file you need and it relates to a cybersecurity engagement that was in process at any time during the period of March 1, 2013 through Feb, 29, 2016, contact US_Cyber_EPD_Help@pwc.com for a consultation. No files subject to OGC Legal Hold are in-scope for deletion. If you see a file you need that doesn’t meet that criterion, make a copy to retain the file before the original is deleted on April 8. Follow these detailed steps for more guidance. You’ll also see a popup prior to the deadline to remind you to review files before they are deleted.

Starting this year, the minimum must be achieved for the performance year in order to be eligible to earn a Tier 1 or 2 annual performance bonus. The minimum will vary by Vertical based on the nature of the work and types of engagements we’re delivering and has been or will be communicated by your Vertical leadership. Your utilization is important because it’s directly correlated to the time you spend working with our clients, which drives your professional development and also has a direct impact on our profitability.

Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. Q&amp;RM’s Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a privacy notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period provides any tax service to a person in a financial reporting oversight role at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a financial reporting oversight role (FROR) in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)). Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Section 7216 consent must be obtained for all tax compliance and consulting engagements for individuals due to the nature of our business operations (e.g., use of GDM resources, third party contractors, back office support, etc.) and if the client requests that we disclose the client's tax return information to their representatives or professional advisors (e.g., the client's legal counsel, secretary, head (or CFO) of family office, etc.). This consent must be obtained prior to disclosing information to third parties. The consent must be signed by the client. Please note that the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information must be obtained annually, including in the case of a multi-year contract. Privacy Policy Notice Tax LOS policy requires that privacy notices be sent to clients when providing individual tax (compliance and consulting) services. The GLBA Privacy Notice must be provided when the client relationship commences. For existing clients, an annual notice must be provided every calendar year. Engagement teams should be sure to use the most current engagement letter templates from the Engagement Letters Index.

Complying with these laws is important since we have and pursue state and local government contracts, and in certain situations, contributions can actually impact our ability to undertake these engagements. In some instances, the "pay-to-play" laws may restrict or prohibit political contributions from Partners to state and local candidates and political committees. In other instances, the "pay-to-play" laws allow contributions, but require the firm to disclose the amounts and recipients. Depending on the jurisdiction, these laws may also apply to a Partner’s spouse, domestic partner and any dependent children To assure our continued compliance with these “pay-to-play” laws, before you, your spouse/domestic partner or dependent children make a campaign contribution to a candidate for state or local office, or to the candidate's political campaign committee, please contact Carole Yanofsky, Government Ethics &amp; Compliance Leader, (see GOVEC Org Chart), or a member of the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) team responsible for Tax risk issues.

Flex + TalentLink automation is here…sweet! Advisory Feb. 5, 2019 As we know, FlexForecast (Flex) and TalentLink have been a thing for quite some time now. And as we approach Valentine’s Day, this pairing is better than ever! A few new enhancements are available to help us manage our engagement financials and resource planning with a little less legwork and a lot more automation. By building out your budgets in Flex early on in the process, the automated integration with TalentLink means: You can secure the appropriate available resources for your projects via a single point of entry in Flex - demand and supply are connected more via automation. Deployment has the necessary time to staff TBDs with the right competencies/skills without multiple emails/phone calls, which is all documented in Flex. You have the most accurate picture of your engagement’s economics. All of these things also mean that our partners and leadership can better connect demand with supply and have a more accurate forecast of our business. Sounds great, right? So, here are the enhancements to Flex that make this “thing” so powerful: Flex Enhancement Enhancement Description Enhanced TBD Fields Captures critical additional information about the staff you need, such as, role description, travel restrictions, skills needed, etc. Project/Resource Indicators Offers a direct link to resources’ TalentLink schedules Incorporates an over-capacity indicator to indicate if resources are over-scheduled Automation Automated overnight feed from Flex to TalentLink allows for next-day insight into resource data. So, what does this mean for how we work with deployment? Starting a New Budget in Flex Identify Need: Rather than contacting our deployers to initiate a new staffing need, enter resource needs directly in Flex, including TBD resources. Be sure to click “Send to Deployment” in Flex once a need is more than 80% likely to sell (i.e., do not wait until we receive a signed engagement letter). Confirm Resources: Our deployers will continue to work together with our engagement teams to facilitate TBD staffing options. After identifying resources, go back into Flex to update the budget from TBD to the staff name. Deployment will not make this update in Flex. In Progress Engagements Make Changes: For in-flight projects, engagement teams must update the Flex estimate-to-complete (ETC) with all schedule/booking updates, which will automatically notify deployers and update TalentLink. Therefore, it is important to actively monitor ETCs at least monthly. Staff Booking Updates: Going forward, please note the following procedure to update staff bookings a. Chargeable Updates: Notify deployer via a Flex ETC update b. Non-Chargeable Updates: Continue to send to deployers via the TalentLink Booking Request Google form If you’d like to access more Flex and TalentLink resources - including FAQs, quick reference cards and videos - please visit our Spark page. And remember, don’t hesitate to reach out to your vertical Finance team with any other Flex questions.

That sinking feeling when you see a typo a split-second after you click “Send.” But with Google Mail, you can retract that email for up to 30 seconds after sending. Save yourself the embarrassment of errors and accidents by enabling Undo Send. Turn on the Undo Send feature in Google Mail: In the upper-right corner of Google Mail, click and select Settings. In the "Undo Send" section, check the box next to Enable Undo Send. In the Send cancellation period section, set the window of time during which you can retract an email. Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes. Now each time you send an email, you'll see "Your message has been sent," plus options to Undo or View message. Click Undo, and you can edit and resend (or delete) your message. That’s it! If only all mistakes were this easy to undo. Want more tips and IT news?

Players from all levels and lines of service participated in the annual competition in which friends, teammates, colleagues and alumni displayed the firm’s value of working together as they compete for the first place trophies. This year, the Tampa team won the Men’s Division, while the DC Metro team, a combination of Tampa and DC colleagues, won its third Women’s Division title in a row. Carlo Bruno, a director and Tampa shortstop, commented on what the tournament meant to him and his team: “We were all excited and honored to represent the Southeast Market with a win in the 33rd annual tournament. After a wild week leading up to the tournament -- with the hurricane and all that came with it -- the tournament was a great way to connect and have a lot of fun with old and new teammates, colleagues, alumni and friends." Jennifer Blevins, a Tampa manager who plays first base for the DC Metro team, said, “We look forward to playing in this tournament every year. Our team has developed some amazing friendships from participating in this event. It gives us the opportunity to reconnect and have a lot of fun away from the office. We were so excited to win another championship, and we look forward to defending it next year!" Want to join in the fun? The annual tournament is held the third weekend of September. The location changes every year and will be selected and planned by the winning teams. There’s always room for more teams to join, particularly women's teams. If you want to learn more about the tournament, please contact Jennifer Blevins or David Llona.

Starting today, you can see for yourself. Here’s what you need to know: Connect Audit Manager and companion tools Starting today, you can manage many aspects of your multi-location audit workflow in one place - limiting the volume of email exchanges. Our new global collaboration tool for group and component teams, including shared service and statutory teams, simplifies and streamlines interoffice coordination and communications by enhancing workflow management, streamlining real-time communication, and providing enhanced status tracking and monitoring of deliverables. Here’s how to get started: Gain an understanding of the following companion tools, which are also now live: Client Base - provides a central place for entering data points for a new Connect Audit Manager site. If you haven’t already, set up your Client Base template (and remember that the SDC can assist with the set-up and administration of Client Base and Connect Audit Manager). Client Base is required to be set up before using Connect Audit Manager. Connect Instructions Tool - assists in creating group instructions for PwC component teams through the completion of a series of questions and prompts. Your responses drive the creation of interoffice instructions and appendices that are in accordance with the applicable auditing standards (ISA, PCAOB and AICPA) and PwC audit policies (Global and US). Be sure to contact your component teams if you plan to use Connect Audit Manager in 2018. Reference materials are available on the Spark site to start this conversation. Refer to Alert 18/34 for instructions on updating certain multi-location EGAs when the use of Connect Audit Manager and/or the Connect Instructions Tool is planned. Learn more and access the tool at the Connect Audit Manager Spark site. For questions regarding Connect Audit Manager and companion tools, contact your US Connect Audit Manager team. Connect v3 The new version of Connect includes faster document upload and download speeds, greater visibility across your portfolio with a new cross-site dashboard and on-time statistics, and Aura integration. Here’s what you should consider as you plan to use Connect v3: Connect v3 is a separate website from the current version of Connect (v2.7). Existing Connect sites will not be automatically upgraded to Connect v3. You can use your existing Connect site until you and your client are ready to use Connect v3. We recommend you transition to Connect v3 as soon as practicable. For calendar year public engagements, this will likely be either before or after the Q2 review is completed. All calendar year-end audits are encouraged to use Connect v3 for year-end requests. To transition to Connect v3, leverage the materials available on Spark, including the information on how the SDC can assist, how to explain the change to your client, and how to use the new features. Refer to Alert 18/34 for instructions on updating relevant Aura EGAs in your engagement files. For questions regarding Connect, contact your US Connect team.

The IRS will open the preparer tax identification number (PTIN) system for 2019 renewals Monday, Oct. 22. It is our understanding the IRS will be sending out renewal notices to all PTIN holders within the next week or so indicating that the 2019 PTIN renewal period is now underway. All tax professionals will also be receiving notification from the firm of a My Compliance Dashboard entry regarding their 2019 PTIN requirement on Oct. 23, 2018. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN and updating your status in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database, you will be required to complete your My Compliance Dashboard PTIN requirement by the due date. As a reminder, the PTIN requirement is a three-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or approved exemption) in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database Complete your PTIN Confirmation requirement on your Compliance Dashboard The PTIN Requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2018 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2018 PTIN before you can renew for 2019. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2018 calendar year. The firm requires all personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must create an entry in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit (link). NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update your status in the database accordingly. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202)346-5219 or Mike McDermott at (949)437-5413.

A few caveats. Please don’t photograph anything confidential or containing client or firm information (whiteboards with client names, laptop screens, client locations).

Such engagements include the following: Tax provision preparation or review Accounting for uncertain tax positions Tax accounting performance improvement GHRS Pension/OPEB valuation, stock-based compensation accounting or deferred tax related services (ASC 712, 715, 718 and/or 740). Because of the risk profile of such engagements, tax engagement teams should be aware of the risk management protocols available to help teams mitigate the risks on these engagements. One such protocol requires that all tax accounting service engagements for non-audit clients be approved by a TAS Market Leader or a GHRS Accounting Services Leader. In addition, tax accounting service engagements that have been designated as high risk require Tax Q&amp;RM approval and the approval and active involvement of a Concurring Partner (“CP”) with tax accounting experience. All approvals should be obtained during the engagement acceptance process and prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. Engagement teams should select the characteristics that apply to the engagement when completing the A&amp;C engagement acceptance assessment to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained during the Engagement Acceptance process. When providing tax accounting services for non-audit clients, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check CES restriction to determine if client is a non-audit client If a non-audit client, initiate the engagement acceptance assessment Obtain TAS/GHRS leader approval and, if applicable, Tax Q&amp;RM and CP approvals Execute engagement contract Begin work For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that a different approval process applies to engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients.

Are you on the path to promotion this year? HQ News March 2, 2017 Team, We care deeply about being a firm where the most talented people of all backgrounds come to reach for their potential. This is not new for us, but we’re always looking for ways to get better. Preparing you to lead at the next level Earlier this year we introduced Blindspots training, based on leading research by Dr. Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard University. This training is about understanding unconscious assumptions that can potentially shape our perceptions, decisions and behavior – and our ability to be effective leaders. As a result, we’re now making our Blindspots training curriculum part of the path to promotion. This means that everyone who is promoted going forward will be required to demonstrate that they have viewed the 4REAL video series as a condition of promotion. We’re not just asking everyone to watch the videos but to make the insights part of our everyday behavior and how we lead. As we advance in our careers and lead and coach others, it becomes even more important to raise our awareness level. Being an effective leader and building strong client relationships starts with earning the trust of those around you. In fact, we’re so serious about developing inclusive leaders that we’ll be requiring all our new hires to take this training, and we’re developing a version of the training to share with students on campus and others. We don’t know of any other organization taking these steps and it’s something we can be proud to share with others. Opening up opportunities for yourself and others Team, we’re a diverse group of professionals who are connected by a shared set of values. I hope everyone will take the training – even if this isn’t a promotion year for you – because our individual actions add up to a stronger culture of inclusion. Offering this training to everyone is another way we make it clear that we are committed to cultivating an inclusive environment. At the end of the day, what most of us want is the chance to be part of great teams and to do work that matters. That starts with knowing yourself and being the best leader you can be.

The wait for Team Drive is over. And it's a game changer High five! The wait for Team Drive is over. And it's a game changer PwC Technology March 24, 2018 Start collaborating in all new ways with Google Team Drives. These shared drives let your team store stuff in a central location -- where all members have access to all of the files, all of the time. When collaborating with Team Drives, teammates can be up-to-date and share a consistent view of content. But wait, there’s more: Onboard new teammates with ease. Every person (and Google Group!) added to a Team Drive gets instant access to all team documents. Cut back on granting file access. All members within Team Drives automatically see the same files regardless of who adds or reorganizes them. Forget about hunting for documents. With team ownership, individual members can’t accidentally remove or delete files that others need. And if a team member leaves the project (or the firm), files remain in the Team Drive. Manage permissions in a snap. Team Drives allow you to specialize permissions based on who needs to edit, comment, organize or delete certain files. Learn more with FAQs Get started To create a Team Drive, complete this form. Your Team Drive will be created automatically, and you’ll receive a link via email. Requestors will have full access to add additional members and Google groups. The fine print Global Business Rules: Be sure to follow these rules before setting up your Team Drives. File transfers: If you are the owner of a file in your personal Google Drive (“My Drive”), you can move it to a Team Drive. But if you want to move an entire folder from Google Drive to a Team Drive, you’ll need to contact US IT Customer Support. Aura: To transfer Google files from a Team Drive to the Aura Document Library, first move the file(s) to your personal Drive.

In order to comply with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) issued by the European Parliament and Council, all lines of service are modifying their respective A&amp;C assessment to include a new set of questions related to GDPR. In the Tax A&amp;C, these questions will be found in Section 8 of the assessment. Each assessment will begin with 3 questions that deal with collection of personal data (how and from whom). Certain answers will trigger additional questions, and certain engagements will require a consultation with the Privacy Office. In addition to the GDPR questions, the A&amp;C questions for PwC Mexico Tax will now be incorporated directly into the assessment. With the exception of anti-money laundering questions, all PwC Mexico Tax questions will be included in Section 1 of the assessment. Also, to provide consistency within the Firm, the assessment for PwC Mexico Tax will now only be available in English. Questions? If you have questions specific to the Tax A&amp;C assessment, please reach out to Adam Noia. If you have questions specific to the new data protection section, reach out to Wendy Samuels or email the Privacy Office (privacy.office@us.pwc.com) for a consultation.

Advisory May 18, 2017 New deployment types are being launched on June 2 in the US Advisory (non-PS) and Cyber map Portfolios. Make sure to choose the correct type when deploying your next map file: US-led engagement: use this deployment type for Advisory engagements (other than Public Sector or Fit for Growth) led by a US Engagement Leader MX-led engagement: use this deployment type for Advisory engagements led by a Mexico Engagement Leader US Fit For Growth engagements: All US Fit For Growth engagements must select this map deployment type. This should only be used for US FFG engagements. Cyber Security Services map Environment map files for all new engagements where we will be providing Cyber Security services should be launched within the dedicated Cyber Services map environment. If you are unsure whether or not your engagement or a piece of your engagement falls into this category, please refer to the FY17 Cybersecurity, Privacy &amp; Risk Product Code Guide. To launch map files within this dedicated environment, you will need to access the CYBER map Portfolio tool in Lotus Notes. A link is also available on the Advisory R&amp;Q microsite. A Few map File Leading Practices Leverage the Gmail and Google Drive Integration Apps. The 'Gmail-Copy to map file' tool, located in your Chrome PwC Actions menu, allows you to copy Google emails to your map file (just as you can do in Notes). The Google Drive 'Copy to map file' tool allows you to copy your Google Drive files into your map file. Read more about these tools. Periodically confirm who has access to your map File. Consistent with firm policy, access to map files must be restricted to appropriate users who have an active role in the engagement and / or have a legitimate business need to know. Access to map files should be regularly reviewed and users who no longer meet these criteria should be promptly removed from the access list. Wrap up map Files for completed engagements. As per Risk Management Policy, map files must be closed no later than 90 days after you complete your engagement. To close the file, click on the "Wrap-up File" link in the “Activities” menu. A map wizard will launch to guide you through the process. Want more map Tips and Tricks?

Your 401(k) contribution rate will apply to both your bonus payment and semi-monthly pay at the end of September. If you're eligible for a bonus, note the following deadlines. Sept. 15 - If you want to increase or decrease your 401(k) Savings Plan contribution percentage rate, make an election at Benefits Express prior to 4 p.m. ET on Sept. 15. Any changes made by that time will affect your Sept. 28 payroll deduction (which includes your bonus payment). Sept. 30 - If you make a change in light of the bonus payment but want to resume your original contribution rate for your Oct. 15 pay, you must make another contribution rate change at Benefits Express between Sept. 16 and Sept. 30 at 4 p.m. ET. If you don’t make a change by Sept. 15 at 4 p.m. ET, your current contribution election will apply to any Sept. bonus payment as well as all semi-monthly paychecks until you change your election in the future. 401(k) Savings Plan contribution limits The IRS limits 401(k) plan pre-tax contributions to $18,500 in 2018 ($24,500 if you will be age 50 by Dec. 31). You can find out how much you’ve contributed to the 401(k) Savings Plan this year by accessing the Financial Well-Being module on myKcurve or reviewing your pay advice. You can also view your calendar year-to-date 401(k) Savings Plan contributions as well as update your contribution election from your iPhone or iPad using the Me@PwC app, which you can find in PwC’s App Store. Note: The Me@PwC app is for US staff only. This app is not available to partners and US staff on international assignment. Don’t lose out on firm-matching contributions Remember, the firm matches 25% of the first 6% of pay you contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan each pay period on either a pre-tax or post-tax basis. Depending on your earnings, contribution rate and the amount of your bonus, the September bonus may result in you "maxing out" your pre-tax contribution early, thereby resulting in a loss of firm matching contributions for the remainder of the year -- unless you elect to contribute on a post-tax basis once you meet the pre-tax limit. To continue contributing to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a post-tax basis if you reach the pre-tax annual contribution limit, go to the Change Contribution Rates page at Benefits Express and select "Continue" in the box below your contribution rate (see below). Here’s an example of an election rate: Questions If you have any questions about your 401(k) elections, please contact Benefits Express at (877) PwC-BenX (792-2369). * If you were informed during your Career Outlook discussion that you will receive an Annual Performance Bonus, it will be deposited into your account at your designated financial institution on Friday, Sept. 28, less applicable taxes and your 401(k) contribution election.

Make sure you’ve initiated, completed and acknowledged all Snapshots, including your self-Snapshot, which is now available. FYI Action The optional self-Snapshot is your opportunity to share your perspective on your progression and impact, including Digital Upskilling. Complete your self-Snapshot using this guide for examples of what to include. ICYMI: See this article for more on sharing your digital impact and highlighting your contributions to tech-enabling PwC. Snapshots are key data points in Career Roundtables along with your LoS Performance metrics (client service). Initiate, complete and acknowledge all Snapshots as soon as possible. All snapshots must be acknowledged in the system by April 30 with at least 80% of your total hours worked covered. Have questions? Reach out to your Talent Consultant, career coach or relationship leader. Advisory note: Snapshots for Advisory staff should include contributions to Digital Upskilling and to the development and adoption of our Integrated Solutions. Here is additional guidance on how to capture these important activities. Assurance note: Assurance staff who do not have 80% of total hours worked covered in Snapshots by 4/30 must follow the FY19 &lt;80% Hours Guidance. As a best practice, we suggest you initiate a practice contribution Snapshot to your Relationship Leader or Career Coach to assist you in reaching 80% of hours covered. Tax note: Snapshots for Tax staff should include contributions to Project 5 Million. Please see the Tax — Digital Impact through CRT slide for additional information on how to capture your P5M and digitization impact.

In January, Tim Ryan previewed changes including a simplified market and sector structure, and the redesign of our IFS functions. The changes to our market and sector structure go live on Monday. These changes are one of many ways our firm is changing and simplifying, so we can be more agile and responsive to our clients as their businesses change rapidly. By simplifying our market and sector structure, we’re also freeing up the time of some of our most experienced client service partners to focus on our clients. Our IFS functions are also moving forward with refreshed organizations and new ways of doing things. Here’s a reminder of what’s changing. Markets We’ve reduced the number of markets. Over time we expect these changes will make it easier to work together -- providing new career opportunities for our people and enhancing the quality and value we bring to our clients. As of Monday, your office won’t change, but the market you belong to will change for many. Click here for additional details on our updated markets leaders Sectors Industry developments have reshaped how our clients define themselves. Our new structure positions us to continue to deliver deep and relevant knowledge from across our sectors as our clients drive and adapt to change. Click here for additional details on our updated sectors structure and leaders Lines of service Our clients want and expect us to bring them the line of service capabilities, sector insight and market relationships that they value. To accomplish this, we work closely together across our firm. As we’ve restructured the markets and sectors, we’ve made corresponding changes to some line of service roles. You can find the updated line of service leadership teams through the links below. Assurance leadership Tax leadership Advisory leadership IFS redesign As we reimagine our business for the future, we’ve looked holistically across our IFS functions and service delivery model to make sure we have the right structure, programs, technology and processes in place to support our next phase of growth.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between October 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) in Q&amp;RM immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with National Q&amp;RM immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

Are you ready to PowerUp! your Digital Upskilling experience? HQ News Sept. 21, 2018 Last week, Tim Ryan announced our new firmwide LIVE trivia game, PowerUp!, which makes its debut today at 2 p.m. ET. PowerUp! Is just one of the ways we’ll all be getting Digitally Upskilled together this year. In the coming weeks, we’ll be introducing many other elements to our Digital Upskilling strategy, which you'll read more about below. In fact, today we’re excited to also introduce the home of all of our Digital Upskilling tools and resources, the Digital Hub. Read on to learn more. Are you ready to PowerUp!? -- make sure you’ve completed these three steps! You’ve downloaded the app, you’ve registered and you’ve even picked an awesome team name. You’re ready to play PowerUp! to win cash while boosting your digital skills and knowledge of our FY19 strategy. Our live, firmwide trivia game starts today. Didn’t get a chance to get the app yet? Don’t worry, you still have time to download, register and play. The PowerUp! app (available for both iOS and Android devices) is available via PwC’s App Store. IMPORTANT: Download the PowerUp! app from PwC’s App Store. Register NOW. If you wait until the last minute, you run the risk of missing questions, which will cost you (and your team if you choose to play as part of one). If you created a team, keep in mind that you MUST have at least two players, and no more than eight, for team play. If your team has only one player, you will not appear on the team leaderboard and will only be eligible to win as an individual. Any member can invite others to join, but to join a team, you must accept in the “Invitations” section of the app. If you’ve created a team, check your team NOW to make sure those you’ve invited have accepted their invitations to join so that you are eligible for team play! Introducing the Digital Hub PowerUp! is the first of our Digital Upskilling resources to launch in FY19, but there’s much more on the way! Coming soon, you’ll be able to find everything related to your Digital Upskilling journey on the Digital Hub.

The wait is over ... get ready to PowerUp! HQ News Oct. 29, 2018 Team, Get ready -- because we’re making a very big investment in you and our future. We’re going to make Your Tomorrow a reality for us and our clients with more learning, more technology so we can transform our engagements for even greater quality and value and more Be well, work well. This is a big journey that we’re on -- we don’t know of any other organization doing this kind of digital transformation at the scale and intensity that we’re doing it. But that doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun along the way. Today I want to introduce you to PowerUp! This is a live trivia game app that we built just for the people of PwC. When PowerUp! launches Sept. 21, we’ll have friendly competition, fun and prizes. For the first six weeks of PowerUp! we’ll compete on what we know about our strategy, about Your Tomorrow and about the emerging technologies that are driving change for our clients and our firm. You can find all the details and FAQs here -- but what is most important to know and do is to download the PowerUp! App (iOS or android) so you’re ready to play. You can play on your own, but the fun and knowledge will be multiplied by playing with your team. From Sept. 21 until our firmwide Town Hall on Oct. 30, we’ll have two live games per week -- on Tuesdays and Fridays at 2 p.m. ET -- and you’ll be playing for $35,000 in prize money each week. (Partners can play along and be part of the fun but aren’t eligible to win.) After these first six weeks, we will continue games on Tuesdays, mainly focused on digital upskilling. This will be exciting and very different. And we’ll also be building the knowledge we need to bring our strategy to life, develop the skills we need to be successful now and in the future. That’s what I call fun with a purpose -- and our purpose is to secure the future for us and the PwCers who come after us. Have fun, and let’s PowerUp! to win together!! -------------------------- Here’s how it works: First, you’ll need to download the PowerUp! App (available for both iOS and Android devices) from PwC’s App Store. Due to the live nature of the game, it’s critically important that you do this as soon as possible so that when the game begins you’re ready to go! Follow the process in-app to register and set up your profile. Here are some additional tips for the best experience: (1) Allow notifications from the PowerUp! App via your phone settings (2) Use the best connection possible (e.g., Wifi or 4G mobile data) (3) Use portrait mode (4) Turn up the volume on phone (please use headphones in open spaces so as not to disturb others) During the challenge period, the game will be played every Tuesday and Friday at 2 p.m. ET. You’ll receive an invitation pushed directly to your calendar to hold the time. You can play as an individual player OR create a team or join an existing one! Note: You can only be on one team at a time. You’ll need to decide prior to playing the game if you want to play on a team. You can join an existing team or create one of your own; anyone can form a team of between 2-8 players, and invite others to join. You will have to accept an invite to join a team. On a team, you will have the chance to win as an individual and with your team since your individual score will still be counted. Teams can change each game and can be defined any way you choose (e.g., engagement team, Development Team, or just a group of colleagues you’d like to play the game with). Points are assessed both as individuals and, for those on teams, each individual’s score will be averaged together with their fellow team members to form a team score (NOTE: Team members must answer the first question to have their score averaged in with their team members to form the team score). While you may switch teams, any previous points that were averaged into a prior team’s score will remain part of that team’s score. At 2 p.m. ET, open the app and you’ll see a countdown until the game begins, then be joined by a live host. Once the game starts, you’ll answer around 10 multiple choice questions. You must read and answer each question in 15 seconds or less to receive points for a correct answer. If you get a question wrong, no worries -- you are not eliminated, you just won’t receive any points. At the end of the game, the individuals and teams who score the highest number of points across the firm (total for individuals and averages among teams) will see immediately in the app if they’ve won, and how much of the $17,500 per game (for a total of $35,000 per week) prize they will receive. The prize money won is proportional to the number of individuals and teams who win each game. In order to cash out, you’ll need to win at least $15 -- depending on the number of individuals playing, you could reach that amount immediately, or it may take multiple wins to be able to cash out. You can also choose to hold off on cashing out until your reach a higher award amount. Note: The cashout feature will not be available until after Oct. 1. Prior to then, you will just accumulate winnings in your player bank in the app. Once you cash out, you’ll receive an AMEX gift cheque or payroll reimbursement in the amount of your winnings.

Take the Energy Audit, and learn more about managi What's your score? Take the Energy Audit, and learn more about managing your energy … one habit at a time Human Capital Oct. 17, 2017 At last week’s Town Hall, Tim Ryan talked about Your Tomorrow and what it means for our people. A key component of this strategy is helping you manage your well-being -- and given the pace and complexity of change we are all experiencing, we know well-being matters. Be well, work well is all about the firm putting the power of its resources behind you and supporting your journey to greater well-being. See where you stand: Take the Energy Audit by Nov. 1. Being well isn’t about being better at managing your time, which is a finite resource. It’s about learning how to better manage your energy, which is a renewable resource you can systematically increase and regularly renew. And that doesn’t mean squeezing more out of you; it’s the firm’s way of helping you remain energized -- both at work as well as when you leave work, so you can accomplish more, in less time, in a more sustainable manner. To operate at our best, both personally and professionally, we need very different sources of energy: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. These represent our four dimensions of energy and none is sufficient on its own. Thousands of our people have already adopted habits that have improved their lives, based on training in Discover, IFS New Manager or other programs. Now, we will change our culture as we make well being a core part of experience. We know many of our clients are interested in this work as well, and it’s an opportunity to share what we are also learning. Well-being is also aligned with the PwC Professional framework expectation of managing self and team energy. How can you start your journey toward improved well-being? Use the firm resources by visiting Be well, work well on Spark. Watch the overview video. Download the Habit Bank app from PwC's App Store. Read the blogs and listen to podcasts from partners and staff. Identify at least one well-being habit(s) that is useful to you, and discuss your plan with your career coach and teammates. Ask your relationship partner what habit she/he is working on and share your goal. Discuss your results in your team, share goals and how you can help each other with a team plan. See team plan templates here. Coming soon: Team Habit Challenge Some ideas ... Find a new habit to keep you and your team energized. For example, at your next team meeting, optimize your time together. Have a device-free meeting or take 10 minutes and go for a walk. Share your Be well, work well habits during your team meetings, and encourage each other to stay on track. What else do I need to know and do?

Including the following steps in the engagement signoff process may save you time, as well as reduce the firm's risk of data loss: 1- Review any legal, regulatory or contractual requirements associated with your specific engagement (including any OGC Preservation Notices). Check the Retention Type for your engagement and ensure it correctly indicates the type of engagement. If you have any questions, review the Firm's record-retention policy (U.S. Records management and document retention policy). Review the Tax line of service documentation policies (Tax Documentation policy). 2- Place any electronic information that must be retained in relevant Document Repositories (e.g., DMS, AURA and Map). Remove any electronic information for the engagement from other places it may be stored including email, laptop, shared drives, Google Drive, Team Drive, etc. 3- Review the access to DMS and consider whether some staff access should be removed as they no longer need on-going access. PwC Tax policy on Confidentiality and DMS Access. 4- If there are hard copy work papers that cannot be scanned, promptly file in the Records Center. 5- Properly secure information saved in electronic format and retained with physical work papers (e.g., encrypt or password protect electronic files saved on CD or disk and stored with physical work papers, storing passwords in a separate email or file section). 6- Any excess information that does not need to be kept for documentation purposes must be returned to the entity or individual from whom the information was collected. Alternatively, if the information does not need to be retained or returned, destroy any hard copy information and delete any electronic information from all storage devices. 7- Redact or remove pieces of information that identify clients, companies or individuals, where applicable, from sample proposals and deliverables before posting information to resources such as knowledge repositories and websites (e.g., remove personal information or client names before posting information on internal knowledge sharing websites). Visit Tax Source for additional information on Tax Data Security, Confidentiality and Your Responsibility, and E&amp;C’s Information Protection Principles document for definitions of the above terms. If you become aware of or suspect a situation where information has or could become lost, please immediately report it to the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS).

Make the most of Well-Being Rewards before the quarter Points earned? Make the most of Well-Being Rewards before the quarter closes National Benefits Sept. 10, 2018 Our Well-Being Rewards Program allows you to earn up to 20,000 points -- $100 in PulseCash rewards -- by reaching each of the four levels during the quarter. Can you make it to the next level? You have until Sept. 30 to accumulate points and rewards for this quarter. Once the quarter ends, the “game” starts over and your points reset to zero -- but you keep any PulseCash rewards you’ve earned. Level up! Quick tips to earn points and rewards One of the unique features of the Well-Being Rewards Program is your ability to personalize your experience with a variety of well-being activities. Here’s a snapshot of activities to earn points. Complete two well-being assets via the Be well, work well playlist - 100 points* Tracking Healthy Habits (up to 3 per day) - 10 points per Healthy Habit Complete a Whil mindfulness or meditation program - 200 points Browse healthy recipes on Zipongo - 10 points Connect your MyFitnessPal account to Well-Being Rewards - 100 points Complete the PwC Envision financial assessment survey - 1,000 points** *You must complete this activity by 11:59 p.m., ET on Sept. 24 in order for points to be credited for the quarter ending Sept. 30. If completed after Sept. 24, points will be credited after Oct. 1. **You must complete these activities by 11:59 p.m., ET on Sept. 23 in order for points to be credited for the quarter ending Sept. 30. If completed after Sept. 23 points will be credited after Oct. 1. Check out the How to Earn section in the app or desktop for more details on how you can earn points. Remember: The more you do, the more you earn. Visit the Well-Being Rewards site or access the app each day to view daily cards, track your progress, participate in challenges and more to maximize your rewards! How do the points and rewards work? You can earn up to $500 in rewards each plan year (July 1-June 30) through the Well-Being Rewards Program. When you accumulate enough points to reach each level during the quarter, you earn the PulseCash associated with that level. For example, once you earn 2,000 points, you earn $10 PulseCash for achieving level one. Then, when you earn 3,000 more points (for a total of 5,000 points during the quarter), you earn the PulseCash associated with level two ($20 PulseCash). This also applies to levels three and four. Once the quarter is over, your points will reset to zero and you’ll start fresh in the new quarter earning points toward levels and PulseCash rewards; you’ll keep whatever PulseCash you may have earned during the quarter. In addition, you can receive up to an additional $100 per year when you complete additional activities under the program -- for example, $50 for undergoing a routine preventive exam. PulseCash is considered taxable income at the time it is earned and posted in your Well-Being Rewards account. PulseCash can be redeemed for gift cards, merchandise, donated to charity, or the cash can be deposited to your bank account (via desktop only). Not registered for Well-Being Rewards yet?

The Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge has been no exception. In an effort to bring the entire firm along on our digital journey and collectively focus on how we can all be our best with our Be well, work well initiative, we put forth a challenge. This week we made it super-clear with 5 Ways, 5 Days. While the deadline is still a few weeks away on May 15, we also know you want to start making your plans for the July 4th holiday. So … here’s the deal. While we can’t declare victory just yet, we have been making excellent progress and I do want to say go ahead and make your plans because YOU’RE GETTING THE JULY 4th WEEK OFF! BUT nothing in life is free, and here’s the catch. We still need you to complete the challenge. I know we’re a deadline-driven culture, and many of us wait til the last minute. My ask is simple. Please take the time -- now or next week -- but do it before the May 15 deadline. And if you’ve already met the challenge, help someone else get over the finish line. Your Tomorrow is important not just for us as a firm, but for you and your career. We’re getting time off -- and we’re also building skills that will help us be successful at work and in life! And that’s a journey that never ends. I look forward to seeing how you use your #PwCTakesABreak time -- share your pics and stories on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram!

We've got some exciting announcements that Got a case of the Mondays? We've got some exciting announcements that are sure to cure what ails you! HQ News April 2, 2018 Tim Ryan: Wherever I travel, I spend time meeting with PwC people -- and with partners who are passionate about the experience our people have at PwC. What I hear is you want to be your best at work and in life. You want to be able to care for yourself and those around you. You want to do work that matters and be recognized and rewarded for doing a great job. And you want to charge up your careers through opportunities like our Digital Accelerator program (as a reminder, Digital Accelerator self nominations close on April 13, so be sure to submit yours soon). We hear you -- and as we enter the final quarter of a very strong year, this seems like the perfect time to say "thank you" in a few different ways. First, as you may have heard from our partners, we're giving a Be well bonus to the people of PwC. The ask is that you use this to invest in yourself (and share your story to inspire others, if you are comfortable doing so). Second, if results continue as we expect, we will be increasing our annual performance bonus pool. Finally, we’re excited to share some meaningful enhancements to our benefits that are designed to support you in caring for your family. So, keep reading to learn more … and don’t worry, this is not a belated April Fool’s Day joke! It’s just our way of saying “thank you” for all you do for our clients, partners, people and firm, each day. A special thanks for the thousand things you do Our business is strong, thanks to your hard work and dedication to delivering quality service to our clients, working together as One Firm and living our purpose and values in all you do. That’s why, on behalf of the partners of PwC, we’re thrilled to announce that a special, one-time $1,000 Be well bonus will be paid next month! Why is this called a “Be well” bonus? It’s simple: Be well, work well -- part of our Your Tomorrow strategy -- is all about everyday behaviors and habits focused on fueling the four dimensions of energy: mental, spiritual, physical and emotional. These dimensions have been proven to help us become and sustain our best selves, both personally and professionally. However you choose to use this bonus, we hope you invest in something that boosts your energy in one of these areas, in a way that is most meaningful to you. Our ask of you -- if you feel comfortable doing so -- is that you share how you plan to spend your bonus to boost one of the four dimensions of energy, so that it may inspire others. You can do so either on social media using the hashtag #bewellworkwell or via email. We’ll feature a selection of the stories we receive on PwC Inside, via our social media pages and in other communications. *The fine print: All US staff in Assurance, Tax, Advisory and IFS are eligible to receive this payment, including those on reduced-hour schedules. Individuals must be hired and working on or before April 15 and on the US headcount as of the payment date (May 15, 2018) in order to receive this one-time payment, which aligns with our annual bonus payment criteria. For further details, read our Be well bonus FAQs. Recognizing exceptional performance: Announcing a potential increase in our bonus pool As with all of our Total Rewards, our goal is to provide meaningful rewards that are market competitive and aligned to our business performance. That’s why, assuming our results stay on track (and we believe they will), we’ll increase our incentive bonus pool up to an additional 10%! To be clear, this doesn’t mean that bonuses will necessarily increase by 10% -- it simply means that our leaders will potentially have a larger pool of resources to recognize differentiated performance through the bonus pool, if we continue to experience strong business performance throughout the rest of the fiscal year. We’ll keep you updated as we get closer to year-end. The fine print: Bonus pools are discretionary and may vary from year-to-year, and by line of service or staff level. If uplifted, each LoS will allocate this year’s uplift to the bonus pool in a way that meets the needs of their business. For example, these funds could be allocated by market, business unit, practice and/or impact. To learn more about bonus compensation, as well as all of our Total Rewards, visit our Rewards Strategy Spark site. You can also read more about the potential bonus pool increase in these FAQs. Supporting families through enhanced benefits From expanding your family through adoption, birth or surrogacy, to caring for a parent or loved one, we take pride in investing in programs and policies that support a broad range of family needs. We also continuously evaluate the competitiveness of our benefits in the market, and make adjustments as needed so you can be your best at work and in life. That’s why we’re pleased to announce several enhancements to our time-off policies related to family leave, including an additional two weeks of paid parental leave and four weeks of paid family care leave. We are also offering improvements to other family benefits including adoption and surrogacy, as well as membership to sittercity.com and eldercare consultation services. The fine print: These enhancements to our family benefits will be effective July 1, 2018. To learn more about these changes, read the Family Benefits FAQs.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between January 1, 2018, and March 31, 2018, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) in Q&amp;RM immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with National Q&amp;RM immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

Perform some formatting magic A little formatting magic lets mobile attendees join with just a tap, without struggling with the code. To accommodate all devices, include both of these formats in your invites: iPhone users: 888-555-1212,,,8675309# Android users: 888-555-1212 Access Code: 8675309# Never put words directly in front of the phone number without a space (Dial-in, Conf call, etc.). If you do, the dialing function may not work. 2. Not the location you’re looking for When Google says “location,” they mean it — a literal address. If you put anything else in this field, the calendar interprets it as a place and things can get messy. Put dial-in info in the “Add description” field. If your meeting has both a room number and a dial-in, list them separately to help apps like Dial My Meeting discern the appropriate code. 3. Meet and exceed expectations Skip all the special fields and formats by using Google Meet, our best platform for calls and virtual meetings. By simply selecting the “Add conferencing” option, your meeting invite will automatically include a Google Meet link and phone dial-in. To join the meeting via mobile phone, simply tap the phone number. If you have trouble finding the dial-in on the iOS native calendar, tap “Show All Notes” at the bottom of the invite, then tap the phone number. After the call connects, enter the code by tapping “Dial…” (next to the red button). For even faster dialing, connect through the Google Calendar app available in PwC’s App Store.

It enhances your ability to plan and track your engagements and better enables our teams to manage engagement economics. With Tax already using this tool, we customized FlexForecast to use in Advisory with our One Firm strategy in mind. Wait ... eFIT and APT are going away? As you heard in a recent email from your Vertical Operations Leader, we will retire eFIT and APT Lite on November 30 (Deals and Public Sector will continue to use their current pricing tools). Shortly thereafter, the Flex ID that is assigned when you create a new budget in FlexForecast, will be required to open a WBS code for any engagement. Where do I learn more about FlexForecast? Start with this 90-second video. If you haven’t already, register for one of the training sessions that your Vertical is running. It is expected that all partners and staff attend one of these sessions and registration and attendance will be tracked. If you’ve registered, but didn’t yet add the session to your calendar, you can do that here. You can also check out the FY18 Advisory Profitability App for easy access to guidance and resources that will enable you to get the greatest value out of FlexForecast. When can I start using FlexForecast? It’s live and ready to be used. Access FlexForecast today and attend one of the upcoming training sessions. The sooner we start using it, the sooner we’ll have the ability to price and budget more accurately and use the estimate to complete to track against actuals for greater insight into our engagement economics.

Pay pre-tax for parking and public transportation -- with new higher limits starting New Year's Day National Benefits Dec. 7, 2017 If you take public transportation to work or pay for parking -- even if you only commute a few days a week -- you may want to consider how the Commuter Benefits Program can make a valuable difference. PwC cares: Lower costs for your commute or parking by paying with pre-tax money The Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax earnings each pay period in a WageWorks account. In turn, you use these pre-tax dollars to pay for work-related transit and/or parking expenses. In fact, using pre-tax dollars for expenses you’re already paying for can save you up to 30% of your commuting costs because you save on federal taxes, state taxes (in most states) and FICA. New 2018 monthly contribution limits The IRS governs pre-tax commuter benefits and recently announced new pre-tax contribution limits effective Jan. 1, 2018. 2017 Limit 2018 Limit Transit $255 $260 Parking $255 $260 You can start, increase, decrease or stop your contribution amount at any time throughout the year at wageworks.com. Maximum parking/transit account balance Starting on Jan. 1, 2018, parking and transit account balances at WageWorks will be limited to a maximum of $1,500. If you have both types of accounts, you may have $1,500 in each. Monthly payroll deductions will be stopped if your account balance(s) exceed the $1,500 maximum. You will then need to enroll in payroll deductions again, once your balance(s) are spent down. Learn more For more information about enrollment and eligible expenses, or to elect or change a contribution amount: Visit wageworks.com. Call WageWorks at 877-WageWorks (877-924-3967). Representatives are available Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. Review the Commuter Benefits Program Description. If you are logged into myKcurve, click here. The Commuter Benefits Program is available to active US staff receiving US pay only. The following are not eligible to enroll in the Commuter Benefits Program: - Interns and temporary employees - Partners and principals - Staff of the Puerto Rico and Mexico offices We strongly encourage Flexibility2TM Talent Network staff not to elect participation because of the timing of benefits. If elected, reimbursement generally can only be made for eligible expenses while employed with the firm. Any remaining funds are forfeited.

The new policies take effect Jan. 1, 2018, barring any changes resulting from tax reform. (Please note: These changes apply to US partners and staff; guidance for Mexico and non-US SDCs will come separately.) The changes start with what many of you asked for: clearer guidance on reasonable spending. We’ve clarified expense policies and added dollar spend limits where it makes sense. Here are the highlights: More flexibility to manage meal expenses when you travel, in the way that’s right for you. Daily limits for out-of-town individual travel meals (including lunch and snacks!) $100 USD per day in high-dollar locations (locations to be announced in December) $75 USD per day in all other locations Travel policies are largely the same, and booking is even easier We’ve simplified the travel booking process, so only in-policy options are now displayed. You’ll still have abundant choices for flights, hotels and car rentals. Be sure to always use the firm-approved Concur Travel/Voyager tool -- using the tool means Security and Travel teams can support you in case of emergency. We’re also working on a new, easy-to-use expense system to be launched in spring/summer 2018. The system will be automated and mobile-friendly -- and best of all, compliance is built into the front end, to help you prevent issues before they happen.

The only DMS sign-off required will be at the DMS Job/Project folder levels (see Section 6 in the TFS Process policy for guidance on finalizing the engagement file). Note that the DMS document sign-off functionality will still be available if engagement teams would like to continue signing off on documents (e.g., for tracking purposes and/or contemporaneous evidence of four-eyes review and partner sign-off). (However, evidence of four-eye review and partner sign-off can also be documented via a memo to the file, completed and signed Tax Engagement Checklist, completed and signed CP/SMS Review Form, emails indicating review, etc.) For additional assistance on documentation and Tax File Standard rules, please refer to the Documentation Toolkit which includes various resources relating to documentation, including firm policies and procedures, checklist templates and tools, etc. In addition, please access the Tax Project Folder listing in each DMS Administrative folder to understand what type of documentation should be included in DMS. Contact any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions. _______________________________________________________________ *Note that this change does not currently apply to IAS DMS version as document sign-off is used as a control for publishing documents to Tiger.

The timing of engagement teams obtaining an approved AFS as part of the engagement set-up process matters in terms of complying with our independence policy. As illustrated below, an AFS form must be approved by the Responsible Partner listed in CES prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. (Note, when providing certain services, you may need to obtain AFS approval from a Secondary Independence Reviewer by adding “AFS SoSRteam” as an Approver on the AFS – see link.) When providing non-audit services to a restricted entity and/or their affiliates, the engagement set-up sequence is important... 1. Check CES; If restricted initiate AFS &amp; engagement assessment process 2. Receive AFS approval from Responsible Partner in CES 3. Complete engagement acceptance assessment 4. Execute engagement contract 5. Begin work The foregoing "sequence" is an essential part of maintaining our independence with respect to non-audit services (a professional responsibility for each of us to manage on our engagements). Best practices to keep in mind: · An AFS is required for all non-audit services provided to restricted entities and/or their affiliates and global priority accounts listed in the Central Entity Service (CES) system and/or in the Global Priority Account (GPA) list included on the Global Client Portal (most easily accessed from the Engagement Acceptance Assessment). Note, a restriction designation is more than an entity being an audit client of the firm. An AFS is required for all restricted entities and/or their affiliates as designated in CES. · An approved AFS must be obtained prior to executing an engagement contract with a restricted client and/or their affiliates. · An approved AFS must be obtained prior to starting work on the engagement – Tax Time Charging Policy. · If the nature of the services changes from what was included in the original and approved AFS, a new AFS and updated contract may be required. Engagement teams should consult with the Responsible Partner in CES to determine if a new AFS is required. If required, a new AFS must be submitted and approved prior to the execution of the amended/revised engagement contract and the commencement of work. If the Responsible Partner determines that a new AFS is not required, the engagement team should document the conclusion in the DMS Administrative folder. · If the CES database indicates that an AFS is required, and you believe the CES database does not contain the correct information regarding the restriction status of a client, submit an AFS and consult with the Responsible Partner listed in CES. If an AFS is not required according to the Responsible Partner, the engagement team should document the conclusion and file it in the DMS Administrative folder. · Engagement teams should prepare an AFS for each year/12 month period of a multi-year contract. It is important that all engagement team members be aware of and comply with our non-audit service independence policies, by understanding the rules and the procedures to be followed to facilitate overall team compliance. For additional information regarding the AFS process -- including assessing permissibility of services, the AFS Process Sequence, protocols regarding Charging Time, and Scope Creep -- see the Tax Independence – AFS Quick Reference.

Some of these devices may be recording or monitoring your activities, even when not in active use. Perhaps you saw the reports of personal conversations being recorded and shared with complete strangers — the danger is real. Your personal, family or firm information could end up somewhere you don’t want it. Yikes! To help protect yourself, we recommend these guidelines: Don’t use smart speakers or other internet-connected devices for firm business. Additionally, turn off the device or move out of range during confidential discussions. Keep your devices secure by using complex passwords. For more, see PwC’s password guidance. Keep work and personal passwords different, and don’t share passwords across devices. Enable two-factor authentication whenever available. This provides an extra layer of security against unauthorized access.

Two exciting updates What's next for Your Tomorrow? Two exciting updates HQ News Dec. 19, 2017 Team, When I think about where we’ll be one year from now, here’s what I see: Our firm will be more digital, and we’ll all have raised our digital IQ so we can deliver the tech-enabled experience that the market is demanding. Our culture of One Firm teaming will be even stronger, which means we’ll be delivering even greater quality and value. And -- team by team -- we’ll be supporting each other in being our best selves at work and in our lives. It’s going to take all of us, working together, to reach our goals. I’m confident we can get there, and have some fun along the way, and I have two exciting updates that I want to tell you about today. Meet the challenge -- get an extra-long July 4 break We’ve listened to your feedback, and what you’ve told us is that our firmwide shutdowns are something you truly value. When we take time off together, we can really unplug and get away. With that in mind, we’ve created a special firmwide challenge. If, as of May 15, 2018, we achieve the following goals around Your Tomorrow, we will shut down the firm for the entire week of July 4! To make this happen, we’ll each get the July 4 holiday, plus three additional days off. Then, similar to our December holiday break, we’ll each give one vacation day to round out the week. Here are the goals we want to meet so we accelerate our progress on Your Tomorrow. This is a real win-win -- we not only build skills that will help us be successful at work and in life -- we have the potential for more summer fun, too. Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off Salesforce Digital Fitness Be well, work well The goal: 90% of us with a Salesforce license have signed into Salesforce and have achieved a Client IQ score of 150 or higher. How to get started: Salesforce is live! If you are a Salesforce user, get in and try it out. But even if you are not, you can support the use of Salesforce by asking partners and managers to share dashboards during meetings, and checking with them to be sure opportunities are captured. The goal: 90% of us take the Digital Fitness assessment and complete two or more quizzes. How to get started: If you haven’t already, be sure todownload the Digital Fitness app from PwC’s App Store or access the web version of the tool and take the assessment, then share your results with your team. The goal: 90% of us take the energy audit, visit the Habit Bank and are part of at least one Be well, work well team plan. How to get started: To date, nearly 20,000 PwCers have taken the Energy Audit. And you and your team can take it to the next level by committing totwo new daily habits through our team challenge -- The habit -- and integrating them into your routine. Coming in January -- another opportunity to help accelerate our digital agenda One important reason for the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge is that we want to build the digital skills of every person in the firm. By the end of FY19, we are working on getting to ‘Digital Basic’ -- that means each of us will have the baseline level of digital skills we need to be part of our digitally-enabled firm. We’ll all drive our own learning using the Digital Fitness assessment and personalized learning paths. After we come back from the holiday break, we’ll give you the opportunity to nominate yourself to be part of the first wave of Technology Accelerators at PwC.

Engagement teams should normally begin the client acceptance process well before the first engagement is won for a prospective client. Not only will this allow for the completion of the client acceptance process before an engagement acceptance decision is required, but completing the process early in the pursuit process will avoid an investment of time in a prospective client that does not meet our client acceptance standards. In certain limited circumstances, engagement teams may need to begin work on an engagement before the client acceptance process is fully completed. In such situations, it may be appropriate for the engagement team to request an accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance exception via the GFS Risk Management Exception process (“conditional request”). Once obtained, an approved conditional request enables the engagement team to issue an engagement letter and obtain a charge code prior to the completion of full client acceptance. An approved conditional request does not replace or serve as a substitute for the firm's full client acceptance process. Accordingly, the conditional request process is used only in specific, limited circumstances. Moreover, even where conditional request is provided, the engagement team must complete the full client acceptance process immediately following receipt of a conditional request. &gt;&gt;&gt; The current client acceptance process, in which Salesforce is the system of record for client acceptance status rather than the A&amp;C system, can take as little as three days when no adverse data is found. Teams should submit an ADS request as soon as a prospective client is created in Salesforce. In most cases, the prospective client will be accepted in Salesforce by the time the entity is validated and added to the A&amp;C system. &lt;&lt;&lt; An accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance can be obtained by submitting a conditional request for a "New Client Entity" (not a "New Engagement/WBS Code") through the GFS Risk Management Exception Code Release Database (click here). A link to the database can also be found in the Quick Links on the Acceptance and Continuance Homepage. Conditional requests will be considered only when the following criteria are met: · The engagement team establishes that it needs to start work immediately due to a time-sensitive opportunity (i.e., the engagement team has won the work and confirmed the deliverable deadline, which does not allow sufficient time for the completion of the standard client acceptance process); · As a result of due diligence conducted by the engagement team, the engagement partner is confident that the results of the ADS performed under the full client acceptance process will not raise any reputational, financial or other concerns that would cause us to decline working for the prospective client; and · The engagement team created the Client and submitted an opportunity in Salesforce and submitted an ADS request. The ADS request should include the appropriate members of prospective client’s management, board members and/or investors/shareholders (e.g., CEO, President, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, VP of Tax/ Director, Chairman of the Board, Audit Committee Chair and/or key investors/shareholders). It is important that the engagement partner be involved in the entire client acceptance process, including the conditional request process. The firm's client acceptance process is a fundamental firm policy and risk management control. The engagement partner is responsible for the proper consideration of all risk management policies and procedures on their engagements. The GFS Exception does not replace the Adverse Data Search and A&amp;C client acceptance assessment process, if required. In general, client acceptance in A&amp;C is required for new, non-audit clients of the US/Mexico firm (generally at the Ultimate Domestic Parent entity level) when: · Adverse data has been identified by the ADS team and you have been instructed to complete a client acceptance assessment in A&amp;C · The prospective client is a foreign entity with no US or Mexico operations (regardless of ADS finding · Your team feels that input from Risk Management or Business Leadership is required to evaluate this new client (regardless of ADS findings) Full client acceptance must be complete in accordance with the instructions provided by the ADS team as soon as possible, and in no event, later than within six weeks of obtaining an approved conditional request. Teams need to perform due diligence and submit supplemental information along with a conditional request to facilitate the expedited, conditional client acceptance evaluation process, which includes responding to the questions listed below. When gathering supplemental information, do not solely rely on the prospective client’s website but rather perform due diligence using resources such as Factiva Google, Google News, Bloomberg, and other reputable tools and share the sources used. The supplemental information includes the following: · Identify the prospective client and briefly describe the related ownership/organizational structure and its business. · Describe the nature and scope of the services to be performed. · Briefly describe PwC's relationships (e.g., lead tax partners, other relevant relationships) with the potential new client, if any. · If the client is referred to us from another PwC member firm, obtain a copy of that member firm's client acceptance or similar information that would be helpful in making the US firm's assessment (e.g., is the prospective client an accepted Assurance, Tax and/or Advisory client of the member firm, how recent was the client acceptance completed by the member firm). · In the event our relationship with the prospective client is limited, perform due diligence on the company, its executives/significant shareholders, directors or the individual client, as appropriate, and provide a copy of the information obtained and the sources from which it was obtained. · Provide list of client’s board members/senior management and link to relevant information regarding such persons. · Identify potential risk factors/basis for your assessment of potential risk factors (e.g., litigation with other service providers, vendors/clients, employees/board members, financing concerns). · Identify potential conflicts of interest. · Document the engagement partner's conclusion as to whether the client should be conditionally accepted as a client, and why. · Identify any reasons to question the integrity of the prospective client, subsidiaries, management team, and shareholders/owners and/or partners. · Provide potential client website link. · Confirm that an ADS has been requested. Important reminders: An approved conditional request DOES NOT replace a Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment requirement. A Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment must be completed in the A&amp;C system for each and every engagement. Resource: Click here to see the "New Client Acceptance Reference Guide - Salesforce".

It is also important that we collaborate with our clients regarding the importance of obtaining timely extensions and filing their tax returns on time. This communication is being issued as part of an ongoing effort to remind engagement teams of the revised due dates for certain tax returns, now entering into the second filing season for which such due dates are applicable, and the steps you can take with clients to reduce the instances of penalties for late-filed returns, missed extension requests, etc. Certain clients may not be aware of the penalties for failure to file timely returns, or understand the time involved or the challenges associated with obtaining timely extensions. Based on recent experience, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain abatement of penalties. To avoid the unpleasant, and potentially costly, surprise of a penalty notice, engagement teams should make a concerted effort to discuss with clients the importance of establishing clear responsibilities for obtaining timely extensions and, if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions, ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting the responsibilities with your clients before extensions are due is an important part of managing this important aspect of engagement execution. For additional information regarding changes in due dates, click here. PwC’s Tax Controversy and Regulatory Services (TCRS) group and Tax Q&amp;RM have published the guidance below regarding the importance of extensions and related best practices. Please read the guidance and continue to collaborate with your clients around this important aspect of our client service. If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact a member of TCRS or Tax Q&amp;RM. Thank you for your efforts in serving clients and representing the firm. * * * * * * Tax Q&amp;RM and PwC’s TCRS group continues to assist engagement teams with requests for abatement of penalties assessed on late-filed returns. While most extensions are timely e-filed or paper-filed, TCRS is seeing penalties assessed in part because: · When preparing to e-file an extension, the person responsible for making certain the extension is accepted by the IRS believes the extension has been e-filed when, in fact, the final act of “sending” or “transmitting” the extension never took place (i.e., “pushing the button” did not take place) or the IRS did not accept the extension. · PwC e-files some extensions and prepares a paper copy of other extensions for filing by the client. The client believes PwC has e-filed an extension when, in fact, PwC has sent a paper extension to the client to mail to the taxing authority. · When filing a paper extension by mail, the person submitting the extension believes that it is timely mailed by generating a mailing label using “SimpleCertifiedMail” or by merely dropping it off in the mail room when, extra steps should be taken to ensure it is processed timely to the U.S. Post Office so there is no risk that the extension would not be considered timely. · For both new and existing clients, the party responsible for e-filing or paper filing the extension is not clearly identified before the due date for filing the extension. · Lack of awareness regarding new due dates for certain tax returns. Recommendations Engagement teams should collaborate with our clients regarding extensions. Engagement teams should discuss with clients the importance of obtaining timely extensions and ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting in writing the responsibilities with your clients before the due date for filing the extension is an important aspect of such client collaboration. To avoid the unpleasant surprise of an IRS penalty notice, clients and PwC engagement teams should make a concerted effort to discuss the following before the due date for filing the extension: · Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for preparing the extension (does the engagement letter with the client discuss responsibility for preparing and submitting the extension?); · Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for e-filing or paper filing the extension; · Who at the client or at PwC will obtain proof of timely filing of the extension (e.g., an electronic confirmation from the IRS that the extension was received; a copy of the U.S. Certified Mail – return receipt form; or a tracking number from one of the private delivery services listed in IRS Notice 2016-30); and · Who at the client or at PwC should provide proof to the other party of timely filing of the extension prior to the original due date? This step of providing proof of the filing of the various extensions prior to the original due date can be an essential step in helping to ensure that all extensions have been properly filed – like other aspects of engagement execution this process should have four-eyes review and appropriate partner involvement. No extension request should be considered as having been filed until proof of filing is obtained. The reviewer on the engagement should ensure that proof of filing on, or preferably before, the statutory deadline for timely filing an extension request (i.e., original due date of return) has been saved in the DMS tax file. Best Practice Suggestions · Review the revised statutory due dates for certain tax returns. In light of changes to the due dates for certain tax returns, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015, familiarize yourself with the new due dates as they will impact the time period for requesting extensions. For additional information on the new due dates, click here. To the extent you have any questions about the new dates, please consult with a member of the TCRS group (for federal tax matters) or a SALT SMS (for state and local tax matters). · Review the e-Filing Procedures With Your Team. We have heard from a number of engagement teams that, after receiving the extension communication in prior years, team members met to review the steps required for e-filing extension requests, and the procedures for confirming that the taxing authority accepts extension requests. We encourage you to consider discussing extensions and e-file procedures with your team members in an effort to mitigate the risk of missed extensions. · Review the Extension Form. Review the extension form to ensure that all required information is included in the extension and that questions and boxes have been appropriately addressed. · Proof That an Extension Has Been Successfully e-Filed. After electronically transmitting the extension to the IRS or state tax agency, you should receive an acknowledgement showing the status of the extension. Typically, the software used to e-file an extension generates an “acceptance” receipt from the IRS. A receipt that contains the status as “Accepted” is proof that the IRS accepted the form. If the receipt contains the status as “Acknowledged,” it is not proof that the IRS accepted the form. Please discuss with your compliance team the procedures to obtain verification that the electronic transmittal of the extension was “Accepted” and the timing for performance of these procedures. Please see the sample screenshot from OneSource or GoSystem at the bottom of this note, which shows what PwC users should be reviewing to confirm that the e-filed extension submitted thru OneSource or GoSystem has been accepted. There is a similar process with those state revenue departments that require or permit e-filing. · Proof That a Paper Extension Has Been Mailed Timely. In some cases, PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and is authorized by the client to mail the extension to the IRS or state tax agency on behalf of the client. Familiarize yourself with the mailroom’s delivery times. It is recommended that time sensitive filings be delivered directly to the U.S. Post Office main window and that proof of acceptance by the U.S. Post Office (e.g., Certified Mail receipt stamped by the U.S. Post Office) is obtained. If you are using SimpleCertifiedMail to create mailing labels, there is a risk that the non-USPS receipt may not be sufficient to establish timely filing. In order to avoid any risk, you should ensure that you have an acceptance scan from the U.S. Post Office on that same date. Although recent case law has allowed the use of a non-USPS receipt date to govern timely filing, there is still an added risk and the above guidelines should be followed. · File an Extension Even If No Tax Due for Year. A tax return that reports a net operating loss, or no tax liability, can still lead to significant penalties being assessed if the return is not timely filed (e.g., returns filed late with Forms 5471, 5472, 8865, etc. attached). File an extension even if the return is expected to report no tax liability for the year. · File Extensions Early. An extension can be filed any time after the end of the tax year and before the original due date of the return for that year. A calendar year taxpayer may file an extension as early as January 1 of the following year. An extension may be filed without a payment, so long as the tax liability for the year is stated on the extension correctly. A corporate taxpayer’s reasonably estimated tax liability, however, must be paid on or before the due date of the return, excluding extensions. · When in Doubt, Call the IRS. The IRS does not notify taxpayers that an extension request has not been filed. If you are unsure of whether an extension is on file with the IRS, you may contact the IRS practitioner priority line at (866) 860-4259. You must have a Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, ready to fax to the IRS if your authorization is not already on file with the IRS. · Due Date Has Passed and No Extension Was Filed. If the due date for filing the extension has passed, please consult with TCRS immediately. In the event that an extension was missed, a return was filed late, or penalties were assessed for the late filing of a return, please consult with TCRS and a Regional Tax Q&amp;RM Partner in accordance with our policy on Troublesome Practice Matters. Additional Discussion In various situations, our clients believe they or PwC filed a timely: · Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns; · Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return; or · Form 8868, Application for Extension of Time to File an Exempt Organization Return. A client may have PwC assist with filing an extension in several ways, including: 1. PwC is engaged to e-file the extension with the IRS on behalf of the client; 2. PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension, and then mails the extension to the client for the client to file with the IRS; 3. PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and mails the extension to the IRS on behalf of the client. If the IRS determines that the return is untimely because there is no extension on file with the IRS, penalties may be assessed under IRC sections 6651(a)(1) and 6651(a)(2) for failure to file a timely return and failure to pay tax timely. However, the largest penalty assessments TCRS is seeing are for late international information returns. Under an automated program, the IRS assesses a $10,000 civil penalty for each late filed: · Form 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect To Certain Foreign Corporations; and · Form 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business. Upon examination, the IRS may also assert additional delinquency penalties associated with other international information returns (e.g., Forms 8865, 8858, 926) that are not filed timely. States may impose similar penalties. These penalties are assessed whether or not the taxpayer has an income tax liability associated with the tax return. A late-filed original return also may jeopardize the validity of a tax election that must be made on a timely filed original return. For additional e-filing resources and information, click here.

Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. Q&amp;RM’s Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a privacy notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period provides any tax service to a person in a financial reporting oversight role at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a financial reporting oversight role (FROR) in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)). Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Section 7216 consent must be obtained for all tax compliance and consulting engagements for individuals due to the nature of our business operations (e.g., use of GDM resources, third party contractors, back office support, etc.) and if the client requests that we disclose the client's tax return information to their representatives or professional advisors (e.g., the client's legal counsel, secretary, head (or CFO) of family office, etc.). This consent must be obtained prior to disclosing information to third parties. The consent must be signed by the client. Please note that the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information must be obtained annually, including in the case of a multi-year contract. Privacy Policy Notice Tax LOS policy requires that privacy notices be sent to clients when providing individual tax (compliance and consulting) services. The GLBA Privacy Notice must be provided when the client relationship commences. For existing clients, an annual notice must be provided every calendar year. Engagement teams should be sure to use the most current engagement letter templates from the Engagement Letters Index.

Below are highlights of some enhancements which may affect you as your teams continue to work with GDM. The Phoenix Spark page has valuable QRCs for each step of the process from creating and submitting an Engagement to submitting a Request and the workflow process around the Requests. In addition, please join the Phoenix Forum and use this platform to share best practices with each other and quickly get answers to your questions not already answered in the QRCs. Engagement Numbers - To help with organization and referencing we have made the Engagement numbers visible in both the Engagement Details as well as in the Engagement Request Package area of each submitted Request. Request Dashboard Simplification - My Requests and My Team Request Widgets have been combined into one simplified Service Requests Widget. Submission from the Engagements Widget and simplified buttons - You can now submit Requests directly from the Engagement widget in addition to the New Request or Reservation &gt; Service Request button. Note: Resource Request is not applicable for Tax at this time. Task Identification &amp; Reassignment for Engagement Teams - Within the Service workflow, at the bottom, of a Request you can identify who on your team has the My Task for a given action. (e.g., Review Deliverable as seen below). In addition, once a Task is claimed, anyone listed as an Engagement Team member on the request can reassign the task to a specific team member to review what GDM has prepared or to facilitate the process should a member of your team be unavailable to action the task. SDC Performing Team Dashboard - A new dashboard has been added for the SDC Delivery teams. Engagement Team members will see this dashboard on the home page, however it will not reflect their performing requests as it is intended for SDC use only.

You’ll learn more over the next couple of months, but for now here’s what you need to know about how our pricing plan will work in FY18. New for FY18: We’ve heard your EMT feedback, and have enhanced the system to allow EMT Engagement Monitoring functionality to be available prior to Leadership IPR approval. This will allow teams to continue to edit resources and hours within the EMT, and to send updates to TalentLink real time. In addition, FY18 EMT IPR approval will be at the new Mega Market level, and SAL/IAL approval is no longer required. We’ve also simplified leader approval to only the FY18 goal. Details on the approval thresholds for FY18 EMT IPR can be found here. FY18 Pricing Overview &amp; Office Hours for support FY18 EMT approvals will be based off of the realization commitments in the 3 year plan. Beginning in July 2017, Engagement Margin (EM) will be an output that we will actively monitor via the EMT Monitoring process. Our EM training on April 4 provided more detailed information on the new metric and how we’ll use it going forward. If you missed the webcast, you can view the replay here. Click here for additional resources including the slides from the training and a helpful QRC. You’ll also notice below that office hours will be held over the late spring and summer to further assist you with Engagement Margin and EMTs.

The Engagement Letter and Document Application (ELD) is a new tool to automate the creation and execution of engagement letters, reducing the risk of non-standard or outdated engagement terms. The ELD is available for engagement teams to create, review and send engagement letters electronically to the PwC Partner or Principal and client for their electronic signatures. The ELD reduces the time engagement teams are spending on contracting and streamlines the review and signature processes. Engagement letters can be easily created and executed within hours of sending to the client. Engagement teams are able to track the status of their engagement letters in one convenient place. The ELD can be accessed via Engagement Center or the ELD stand alone application. Engagement letters created in Engagement Center will be automatically filed in the DMS project folder when fully executed letters are received back from clients. The most popular, general templates are now available for creation in ELD with more on the way for all the practice groups. The templates currently available for use are: · Tax Compliance – Corporate EL · Tax Compliance – Partnership EL · PFS Compliance EL · PTPA Compliance EL · Tax Consulting Services EL · Recurring Services EL with Statement of Work (SOW) · Statement of Work under Recurring Services · Master Limited Partnership EL (restricted to MLP practice) · Coming soon: Transfer Pricing, Corporate Executive Program and Specialized Tax Services (STS) letters The current version of the ELD handles letters where clients accept our standard terms. Upgrades for even more versatility are scheduled and suggestions are welcomed. To learn more, visit the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite on Tax Source for additional information and training videos on how to create engagement letters within Engagement Center and how to upload a custom Statement of Work (SOW) template in ELD. A shorter walk-through video on the review and signature processes is also available for PwC Partners and Principals on the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite.

The new policies take effect Jan. 1, 2018, barring any changes resulting from tax reform. (Please note: These changes apply to US partners and staff; guidance for Mexico and non-US SDCs will come separately.) Highlights include: You'll have more flexibility to manage meal expenses when you travel, with daily limits for out-of-town individual travel meals (including lunch and snacks). Travel policies are largely the same; we’ve simplified the travel booking process, so only in-policy options will be displayed in Concur Travel/Voyager (you’ll still have abundant choices for flights, hotels and car rentals). We’ll also launch a new, mobile-friendly expense system in spring/summer 2018. Compliance will be built into the front end, to help you prevent issues before they happen. Final travel and expense policies, including high-dollar locations where the $100 USD per day daily limit will apply, will be announced later this month and posted on the Finance Spark site. Watch PwC Inside for updates over the next few weeks. We’re also working through details for instances where client and hotel location differ, travel takes you through multiple cities on the same day, and how to handle group snacks. What do you need to do? Always use the firm-approved Concur Travel/Voyager tool -- it’s cost-effective, and our Security and Travel teams can support you in case of emergency. Continue using the Mobile Expense system to submit expenses until our new system launches in spring/summer 2018 (more details to come next year). Read up on the highlights of our new travel and expense reimbursement policies and watch for the actual policies later this month; they’ll be effective Jan. 1. Visit this Spark site for an overview and FAQs. Still have questions? Join us Friday, Dec. 15 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ET for our next Q&amp;A session, where representatives from Finance, Travel and Ethics &amp; Compliance will again be on hand to answer your questions right here on Spark. (Add a reminder to your Google Calendar - change your availability to “free” when you save.) Highlights from our Dec. 1 session are below. Highlights from Dec. 1 Q&amp;A session on Spark Thank you to everyone who joined our live chat last week. We had some great questions and dialogue. Here are a few highlights. Read the overview and FAQ documents on our Spark site for more details. Group meals when one person pays the tab: What happens when a team goes out together, and one person puts the tab on their corporate card? Travelers need to stay within their daily meal cost limit ($100 USD per person in high dollar locations / $75 USD per person in all other locations), and their share of the group meal counts toward that limit, so please exercise care and judgment in this area. The new expense system will tie the names of attendees to the group meal. While the system will not automatically subtract group meal allocations from individuals' available daily maximums, overages will be monitored. How to handle my advance grocery run, for when I’m traveling for the week: Often I'll go to a grocery store and get items for breakfast and lunch for the week. How would the new system handle this? This practice is acceptable, but daily limits apply each day and cannot be averaged over the course of your trip. Careful thought was put into establishing the daily maximum amount, which should be reasonable and sensible in most circumstances (even if breakfast/lunch is purchased at a grocery store for a few days). Will fully-refundable options still be available for flights? We do expect, unless there is a high probability of a trip change or cancellation before departure, that a non-refundable ticket be purchased. Fully refundable tickets will continue to be an option in Voyager/Concur Travel and partners and staff are expected to exercise reasonable judgment to determine whether a refundable airfare is more cost effective. Booking business or first class travel: Will upgrading to business/first class still be allowed, or is economy going to be the only option? Business class fares purchased on flights longer than 3 hours are allowed for partners, managing directors and eligible participants in PwC’s Frequent Traveler 75K program. Partners/staff not eligible for above coach seating may use frequent-flyer miles to upgrade, but only the coach ticket is reimbursable for North America (request the upgrade after purchase of the coach ticket). How will the new expense reporting system handle out-of-policy expenses? And what about receipts? We’ll share the full details when the new expense reporting system goes live in spring/summer 2018. But expenses that are not within policy will prompt one of the following responses based on how severely the expense is outside of policy: 1) a front-end alert visible to the expense submitter, 2) an approval request routed to the expense submitter’s leader, or 3) partial expense submission rejection (for the significantly out-of-policy portion of the expense). The new policies and system will have the same receipt requirements as before, but will save you time by allowing mobile uploads (once the new system is implemented in spring/summer 2018). Still have questions? For additional details on the expense policy changes, check out the overview and FAQ docs on the Finance Spark site.

Google uses machine learning to generate remarkably accurate, real-time captions — sometimes even self-correcting as it gathers additional context from the speaker. Impressive! Google Meet’s live captioning is a significant enhancement for professionals with hearing disabilities and non-native English speakers. It’s also helpful if you’re struggling to hear in a noisy environment (airports, anyone?). Or maybe you just forgot your earbuds and don’t want to disturb your colleagues. Live captions are not recorded or stored for future reference — they’re only available in the moment. I’m sold! How do I turn on live captions? Each participant controls captions on their own screen, and they’re only visible to that individual. Here’s how to turn on live captions on your PC: In Meet, select the triple-dot menu at the bottom-right. Select “Turn on captions.” Live captions are also available on Chromebox for meetings (using a remote) and Chromebase for meetings (using a touchscreen device). Learn more on Google Help Center.

Is it me you're looking for? Hello. Is it me you're looking for? PwC Technology July 26, 2018 Windows Hello is a new way to sign in to your PC with just a look or a touch. Your PC will recognize you using a fingerprint or face recognition, eliminating the need for a password. It’s secure, logs you in quickly, and you can always use your GUID password as backup. Your fingerprint or face never changes, meaning you’ll never be locked out of your laptop. Windows Hello works with any PwC laptop that has a fingerprint reader, and with laptops that have an infrared camera for facial recognition. Either way, Windows Hello recognizes you instantly. It’s a new way to use technology to simplify your workday. How do I get started? Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options Select the fingerprint and/or the face recognition option. A “Welcome to Windows Hello” box will pop up. Select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions. You’re not required to remember the PIN. It can be used once to register your fingerprint/face and then forgotten. If you’re ever prompted for your PIN, you can manually select to use your GUID password instead of the PIN. Your PIN must be at least 12 characters long It must include at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter It must include at least one number and one special character What options does your PC offer? Nearly all PwC PCs -- 92% -- are equipped to recognize your unique biometric login. Here’s an overview of their capabilities. Laptop model HP EliteBook x360 1030 G2 Dell XPS 13 (9365) HP EliteBook 840 G3 Dell Latitude E7470 Dell Latitude 7480 Dell Latitude 5285 Dell 5510/5520 Capability Camera/Fingerprint Camera/Fingerprint Fingerprint Fingerprint Fingerprint Unavailable Unavailable Concerned about privacy? Don’t worry -- the info that identifies you never leaves your PC. During setup, the camera or fingerprint reader creates a “data representation” similar to a graph, encrypts it and stores it on your PC. Actual images of your face or fingerprint are never captured on your device or elsewhere. Find out more about privacy. Want more tips and IT news?

It's another way we're modernizing and simplifying the way we work. We learned a lot from our successful Dallas pilot — and Mobile Only is coming to your office in 2019! So what’s it like to make the jump to our new way of working? We call it “Mobile Only” because you’ll only have a mobile phone number. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t have other communication options. Enclosed offices and conference rooms will have landline speakerphones with fixed local numbers, which can be used for incoming, outgoing and international calls. Open workstations will not have desk phones. You’ll be notified when it’s time for your assigned office to transition. Here’s what to expect: Your office landline phone number will be retired. You’ll have just one phone number and voicemail box. Simple. We’ll use mobile phones, Google Meet and WebEx. We’ll no longer use Jabber Softphone. Reception will connect callers with mobile phones (they will not give out numbers). Executive assistants will no longer answer partner phones. Your office’s main phone numbers and group numbers (like service centers) will remain unchanged. This is how we do it: Four ways to make calls when you’re in a Mobile Only office Don’t let the name Mobile Only fool you — you’ll still have lots of options to place calls. You can use … Your mobile phone. Spotty cell signal? Wi-Fi calling can help (more below) Google Meet for laptop, mobile app — or via phone (more below) WebEx (laptop or mobile app), which includes a dial-in option A landline speakerphone, available in any enclosed office or meeting space The ins and outs of dialing from Google Meet Dialing goes both ways in Google Meet: You can dial into a scheduled call using the phone number in the calendar invite, or dial out to add participants from the US and Canada. This means you can place a call from your PC any time, similar to softphone. Simply launch Meet and click “Meeting details” in the lower-left corner of your screen. You’ll see “Add someone by phone” — enter their number and press the call button. Can’t see the dial-in number in your smartphone’s native calendar? You’ll have a better experience with the Google Calendar app, available from PwC’s App Store. Help! My cell signal is less than ideal Before each office goes Mobile Only, we assess cellular coverage and upgrade our office networks to support increased reliance on mobile and Wi-Fi technology. But if you hit a dead spot and need a boost, Wi-Fi calling lets you talk and text over Wi-Fi. In a pinch, use one of the other options covered above. What happens when people call my old number? Callers will reach a new automated greeting that includes your mobile number (like this sample greeting). If you opt out, a generic PwC greeting will allow callers to reach reception (your mobile number will not be disclosed). Greetings will remain active through May 2020. Stop by our Mobile Only site for FAQs and a short guide to our modern way of working — or ask a question here. Have general feedback about Mobile Only?

(Photo courtesy of Fortune) Last year Tim Ryan made a commitment that our firm would do more to take on issues of race and inclusion in the workplace -- both inside PwC and in society more broadly. Since then, whether Tim is welcoming new interns, or meeting with CEOs, the topic of diversity is part of the conversation. It's not what he expected when he took on the role of senior partner on July 1, but it's something he's come to believe is critically important. This week Fortune magazine profiles Tim's efforts. He shares the events -- both personal and professional -- that have inspired him to talk openly about race in the workplace and to make this a priority for PwC. Tim says, "The question I keep asking myself is, are we doing all we can do? The actions we’ve taken within our firm are very important, including the new requirement that everyone who is promoted complete our Blindspots training." “That’s a great start, but as I’ve talked to other business leaders, I’ve found that many share the same concerns as we do at PwC. They are concerned that employees feel unable to talk about these important issues at work.” No single organization can solve these issues alone In response, Tim is bringing diversity into his discussions with business leaders across many industries. Last week he discussed race and inclusion at Davos. This week he joined more than 100 business leaders for a conversation on diversity hosted by the New Jersey Business Partners Roundtable. Tim says, “I’m talking with other business leaders because no single organization can solve these issues alone. In the near future I’ll be updating you on our plans to join with others in the business community for greater impact on issues of diversity and inclusion.” Check out Tim's profile, and share it, too.

The training is live today -- feel free to dive right in! More to know Clearing your AmEx buffer: On July 9, new AmEx charges shifted to SAP Concur Expense. Any expenses that hit your AmEx buffer after July 9 will be waiting for you in the new system. This may also include charges from the days leading up to July 9, depending on the timing of when vendors submit their charges to AmEx. Important! By July 16, your legacy Mobile Expense buffer must be empty and all expenses submitted. Anything that remains July 17 will be marked as personal. You’ll have to pay AmEx directly and submit as an out-of-pocket expense if a valid firm expense gets marked as personal. (Add a calendar reminder for July 16 to double-check your legacy Mobile Expense.) If you need help with an AmEx reconciliation for charges incurred prior to July 9, submit this form for support. Please note: AmEx reconciliations will not be provided for SAP Concur data. As we move to the new system, we’ll each be responsible for reviewing our own AmEx statements and reconciling payments. Downloading the mobile app: If you previously downloaded the SAP Concur mobile app for travel use, the app will automatically push out an update with all the new expense benefits.

Here's what you need to do. You must complete a "notification" AFS for C2 GPA clients in the same manner as you would for a restricted entity. This means the "notification" AFS must be completed, and submitted to the Global Relationship Partner ("GRP") listed in CES before you execute the engagement contract and before you begin work ("engaging" with the client). A "notification" AFS is required for all related entities of C2 GPA clients. You will need to search for your client in CES. If your client is not designated as restricted or as a C2 GPA client in CES, you must also be sure to check the GPA list included on the Global Client Portal. Note: You should also check the status of the client’s domestic and global ultimate parent. If the parent is a C2 GPA, you will need to prepare a "notification" AFS for any work performed for it and its subsidiaries and related entities. Although C2 GPA clients are not audit clients, a "notification" AFS is still a control for the Firm so that the GRP listed in CES for C2 GPA clients and related entities is notified of new services (accordingly, the AFS does not need an "approval confirmation" from the GRP listed in CES). Identifying and submitting the appropriate notifications for C2 GPA clients and their related entities requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. Additional information is available in the Channel 2 Guide: Preparing a Channel 2 AFS Request found under the AFS Help - Policy Guidance section in the AFS system. For further information contact any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions.

Below is just a sampling of the new apps PwC’s App Store offers to help you get where you’re going with minimal fuss, muss, wear and/or tear. Don’t forget, we’re looking for the best App4That -- for travel, for work, for productivity, for getting stuff done and making life simpler. It’s all about continuous improvement for Your Tomorrow. Recommend the apps you use, and you could win a new iPhone X. Get ready with Packing Pro If you always forget your charger -- or leave for vacation while your swimsuit stays home -- Packing Pro is for you. It features customizable packing lists for different types of trips, which can be synced and shared with others. With a huge catalog of lists and built-in assistance, you can pack based on your trip’s purpose, length, weather, travel partners, etc. And when you head home, you can make sure all your stuff goes with you! It’s the No. 1 travel app in the US and one of Apple’s "10 Essentials" -- so we purchased Packing Pro to help you travel efficiently. Get to your gate with airline apps and FlightAware For times when you can’t believe your flight’s gate changed again, we bring you FlightAware, an innovative live flight tracker. PwC’s App Store offers Concur, TripIt and apps from every major airline -- but FlightAware can track the real-time status of any commercial flight worldwide. Data includes complete flight details and live maps with NEXRAD radar overlay. You can also enable notifications for departure/arrival info, cancellations, gate changes, delays and diversions. Another gate change? You’re on top of it. Get around with Curb, Lyft, Uber and Waze Curb is the top taxi app in the US, connecting you with 50,000+ drivers in 65 US cities. What makes it special? You can request immediate pickup or schedule up to 24 hours in advance. You can pay with cash or through the app. You can even use the app to pay for rides you hail on the street in some cities. PwC’s App Store also offers Uber and Lyft, oh-so-handy when traveling where taxis are scarce. (Enter your corporate AmEx for easy expensing during work trips.) And if you’re not using Waze to beat the traffic and navigate new cities, you should really get on that. Game-changer. Get a free iPhone X (... maybe!) Submit your favorite app, and you could win an iPhone X or another cool prize. PwC’s App Store is bringing you a better digital experience, while helping you serve clients more effectively. Think about the external (non-PwC) apps you already use. What would you recommend to your teammates? Here’s how to enter: iOS users: Visit PwC’s App Store and download the App4That contest app (if you don’t see it in Featured Apps, update your iOS). Complete the short form.

Don't miss the Reportable Transact Jan. 31 is right around the corner. Don't miss the Reportable Transactions deadline One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 10, 2019 The next material advisor registration deadline is January 31, 2019. If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between October 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including Section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include Section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Generally, the threshold amount for a Section 165 loss is $10 million in a single year for corporations and partnerships with only corporate partners and $2 million for all other partnerships, S corporations, and individuals. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual including via a partnership or S corporations) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

Maria Moats: Q1 update &amp; news you can use -- plus bonus plan details. Oct. 12, 2018 Focusing on the quality of our execution Team, I’m excited about the progress we’ve made in FY19 Q1 and where we’re heading as a practice. We’re clear on our strategy, and we’re moving forward from a position of strength. As we prepare for busy season, let’s continue to focus on driving audit quality and consistent execution. I also wanted to provide an update on our FY19 Performance bonus plan -- how we share the firm’s success and reward your personal impact. Here are some details to know: Your Total Rewards Summary in the Me@PwC app provides target bonus ranges and impact tier distribution, as well as insight into the earnings potential across levels. You will note that the tier distribution helps differentiate bonus decisions, so that people with greater impact receive a higher reward. Note: The Me@PwC app is for US staff only; this app is not available to US partners or interns, residents of Puerto Rico and Mexico, or US staff on international assignment. Funding of the FY19 bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Paying at, above, or below the target bonus ranges will be determined by whether we meet, exceed, or fall short of our goals. Stay focused on your individual goals, which should be aligned to those outlined in the Assurance FY19 Expectations Placemat -- and, remember to go to Employee360 in myMetrics during the year to view your progress toward achieving those goals. The financial reporting profession is important, as Tim Ryan notes in his blog. Below, you’ll find other important updates and news to help us focus on consistent execution. Please take the time to be up to date. As always, I want to hear from you, so if you have feedback, please share it by sending to us_assurance-feedback@pwc.com. Thanks for all you do!

As of 9/30/18, revenue and bottom line are below budget, driven by a shortfall in both rate and volume. Engagement margin for the practice year to date is 35.6%, down 0.2 pts to budget and an increase of 2.3 pts over PY. As we move into the second quarter, please focus on timely billing and cash collections, and monitoring WIPs/ETCs on a timely basis. Our One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) is here to help. Here’s what the changes mean for Assurance: Create will be used to generate all engagement letters. Contracting Risk Management Partners (CRMPs) must be consulted for certain proposed modifications to all engagement letters (click here for more information) Specialists are available to assist you on engagement-related questions pertaining to contracting, independence, quality, regulatory compliance, and risk management. Assurance Risk Management changed its name to Assurance Quality Management. There are no new or additional consultation requirements for engagement teams as a result of the creation of OFRO.

As you review the following principles, consider their application in light of the type of tax services you provide and engagements you work on. Proper application of the data security principles will not only reduce the firm's risk of data loss but may also reduce hours in the engagement and hours in your workday. Collect and use only the minimum amount of information necessary for your work If you don't need it, don’t collect it. If the client provides information outside the parameters of your request, return it to the client in a secure manner. Do not add hours to your day and the engagement maintaining data you do not need. Share information with others only as needed Apply the concept of "need to know" and manage access to electronic information (e.g., DMS) in the same manner. Not everyone on the engagement team needs the same level of access. Encrypt all confidential information in external emails and on data storage devices Determine the most secure method to exchange confidential information between PwC and external parties. Encrypt documents sent via email, on USB flash drives, CDs or other data storage devices. Secure information and devices when not in use Protect client information whether in hard copy, or on laptops, mobile devices (i.e., iPhones, iPads, or other cellular devices) or data storage devices. Lock up confidential information and devices when not in active use. Do not leave your computer unattended and in standby mode. Report stolen laptops or mobile devices immediately to US IT. Use only firm managed equipment and email accounts for work related matters Only use personal devices with the firm’s approved secure connectivity software installed to access client and non-public firm information. Do not use home PCs, personal email or instant message accounts, or other nonapproved technologies to access client and non-public firm information. Be aware of how your physical surroundings can put information at risk Secure confidential information by locking file cabinets, promptly picking up printouts or faxes, and by not discussing confidential matters in open spaces. Do not let individuals without proper ID into PwC offices and work spaces. Securely destroy or return information that is no longer needed Do not retain unnecessary information –electronically or in hard copy. Promptly return hard copy files to the Records Center when no longer needed. Return or properly destroy what is not part of your work papers. Retain all information in accordance with firm policies and other requirements. For more information please visit Tax's site Tax Data Security and Confidentiality or contact a member of the Tax team. If you become aware of or suspect a situation where information has or could become lost, please immediately report it to the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS).

This new screen allows BMs to sign-off and process a PV directly to myEngage. EM% toggle: Teams now have the option to calculate the engagement fees based on their desired EM%. Live bookings in TalentLink: All hours sent from EMT to TL are now sent as live bookings overnight, reducing the wait time to get them approved and see them reflected in TL. New TalentLink Upload screen: Users should navigate here in order to submit delta changes from EMT to TL and run reports to review their changes for TL. You now have the ability to upload for multiple Job Names with one click as well as review the changes being sent prior to sending them. View All DT View: On both Budgeting and Monitoring DTs, users have the option to view hours in total for all resources budgeted across DT tabs within a Detail File. They can also drill down each resource to see the breakdown of hours in each DT tab. IMPORTANT: In April we will have additional changes to the Billing and Collections process, including enhancements to the Bill Plan screen. Please refrain from setting up your bill plan in both EMT and myEngage until training is held in early April. In the interim, you should send individual bills through myEngage.

New features released and future roa Using Mapper and Tax Adjustments? New features released and future roadmap! Tax Sept. 28, 2018 You now know the basics of Mapper and Tax Adjustments.These tools aimed at helping you meet your Project 5 Million goals are always evolving. Check out the new features and what's to come for each application. Top Features Released for Mapper Import Wizards for Client Accounts and Trial Balance - You can import using non-standard templates and have the ability to solve for typical formatting issues such as Account Numbers and Descriptions being in the same cell and handling data where reporting units are in columns vs a stacked format. These capabilities should save you additional time and reduce the need to create Alteryx workflows to reformat your data prior to import. Trial Balance Metrics Report - This report allows you to confirm you have the correct starting point (e.g., total current assets, total non-current assets, etc.) within Mapper rather than waiting to review in a downstream application. 1065 Book Return Report - Teams can now view their client information in the form of a 1065 book return. 1120S Book Return Report - Teams can now view their client information in the form of a 1120S book return. Break Even Report - This report shows which reporting units are driving book income vs. book loss. Check out the Mapper Release Notes for more features! What’s next for Mapper? In the spirit of continuous improvement, below are the major features on the Mapper Roadmap: Updated User Interface (UI) - Mapper will have a new UI experience to make it more intuitive to use. While the functionality will remain the same, the look and feel will be updated. Rollover - Mapper will have a rollover experience that allows you to prepare for the next filing season. Mapper to Tax Adjustments Direct Integration - With the push of a button Mapper will be able to send data to Tax Adjustments and also receive mapping changes made in Tax Adjustments. Document Connect - Mapper will be able to interact with DMS allowing users to pull in trial balances from DMS and save Mapped Trial Balances to DMS more efficiently. Top Features Released for Tax Adjustments Book To Tax Workpaper - In addition to the Schedule M-1 report, each pro forma workpaper sets now has a standard book to tax reconciliation workpaper. You are also able to drop in the differences calculated as part of the tax provision and the workpaper will compute the difference between provision and return amounts. Page Level Review Sign Off - You are now able to signoff by role (preparer, 1st Reviewer, 2nd Reviewer, 3rd Reviewer) or indicate it is still “open”(needs review or re-review after changes) on each of the tabs. The tab color changes based on the highest signoff. An “open” status always overrides all review signoffs. Central “Other Section” Data Entry - You can now add or edit data you want in the “Other” section of some or all adjustment workpapers within a workpaper set on one tab (e.g., all 2 ½ month cash payments, tax depreciation, etc). This saves you the time of navigating to each workpaper in a workpaper set, scrolling down to the “other” section and entering the data. Tax Adjustments to OIT Integration - You are now able to utilize a bot to transfer data from the tax adjustment application to Onesource Income Tax. Consolidation Reports - You can create one or more consolidation structures (including sub-consolidations and divisional consolidations). The structures are used to combine the applicable pro forma and eliminations data to generate consolidated review workpapers (1120 Page 1, Sch L, M-1, M-3, 1125-A). Check out the Tax Adjustments Release Notes for more features! What's next for Tax Adjustments? Audit Ready Workpapers - You will be able to export a clean and audit ready report for each workpaper set in PDF as support documentation which can be saved in DMS. Rollover - Tax Adjustments will have a rollover experience that allows teams to prepare for the next filing season. Direct Mapper Integration - You will no longer have to import an excel file from Mapper. You will be able to directly push data from Mapper to Tax Adjustments. You will be able to send Mapping changes from Tax Adjustments back to Mapper. Blank Workpaper Sets - You will be able to create blank workpapers sets and manually drop in financial statement amounts. This feature will be helpful for entities where you do not receive trial balance from clients. 1065 Workpaper sets - Similar to 1120, Tax Adjustments will support 1065 workpaper sets. Mapper &amp; Tax Adjustment Support Resources Support for the application is available through the following channels: Check out the Mapper Forum and Tax Adjustments Forum for FAQs and recent release info. Users can post non-urgent questions in these forums and other users can respond. Make sure to join the group to get all the latest discussions and announcements. Go to the Tax Source pages for Mapper and Tax Adjustments for information on getting started, using the applications, and process improvement guidelines. For immediate assistance, call the Helpdesk at 877-PwC Help. There are dedicated Mapper and Tax Adjustment support agents ready to help. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is Mapper? Mapper leverages Machine Learning to map the Client’s Trial Balance Data to PwC standard taxonomies. What can take weeks in Excel, takes a matter of minutes in Mapper. Using previously supplied and verified training data, Mapper leverages the Account Description, Account Type and Natural Balance from the Client’s Chart of Accounts to present a suggestion on the PwC Standard Taxonomy that best matches the account. If you previously mapped your client’s accounts to tax forms, Mapper includes a utility you can use to convert those mappings to the PwC standard taxonomy. What is Tax Adjustments? Tax Adjustments is an application that significantly streamlines the calculation of 80+ common book/tax adjustments by seamlessly integrating the exported data from Mapper. In a matter of minutes, each entity whose data is imported from Mapper will have an initial calculation of taxable income and what the tax return will look like. Users can then apply manual updates to refine taxable income as well as review and sign off on each workpaper. Tax Adjustments includes reports that allow users to review a “walk across” presentation from book balances all the way to tax form amounts. These are available for form 1120 page 1, cost of goods sold, schedule L, schedule M-1, schedule M-3 and Form 8916-A. All of these can be reviewed prior to exporting the data to your preferred tax software. If you have questions or would like more information, please contact Daniel Mason or Nicholas Dolecki.

Don't miss the Reportable Transac April 30 is right around the corner. Don't miss the Reportable Transactions deadline. One Firm Risk Organization April 4, 2019 The next material advisor registration deadline is April 30, 2019. If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between January 1, 2019 and March 31, 2019, or any previous quarter, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection (including contingent fee engagements), Section 165 loss transactions (including Section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include Section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Generally, the threshold amount for a Section 165 loss is $10 million in a single year for corporations and partnerships with only corporate partners and $2 million for all other partnerships, S corporations, and individuals. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual including via a partnership or S corporations) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transactions Toolkit or contact a Tax Controversy and Reporting Services (TCRS) specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions. For any questions please contact a member of the OFRO Tax team. Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/12771.html</url><pwc_title>You Asked...We Answered.

Thank you for all you’re doing to prepare the firm, practice and most importantly yourselves for the future. We’re well into the transformation, our strategy is clear and not changing, and we’re already moving the needle on the way we work. Remember, under Your Tomorrow, P5M, we are leveraging technology to remove hours and create capacity to address the tremendous growth opportunities that exist in the market, and for you personally. Your role is to use that capacity to bring our Cx strategy to life by engaging with clients, to invest in developing your own tax technical and digital skills, and to make time for our Be well, work well habits. Embedding this strategy requires applying a digital element to each engagement and deliverable. Our One Firm strategy is only as effective as the actions we take to bring it to life. Each of you is behind the energy and drive in Tax for P5M. For example, as Digital Lab prepares to go One Firm, we have contributed well over 350 approved automations, a great example of our citizen-led innovation. If you have questions, Project 5 Million on Tax Source is our new home for all content and resources on P5M. The site includes guidance on how to record hours that you have saved through digitization and how to charge time spent on innovation efforts. In other news, read about the Tax partners that have taken on new roles to help our teams execute on our strategy. I’m excited about the possibilities ahead of us -- and hope you are, too. Keep up the good work. Regards, Tax reform Click the roadmap below to learn more about the conversation starters. Check out the latest edition of Inside Tax Policy -- an interview with Roy on questions and challenges surrounding Tax Reform. Update on annual performance bonus program Refer to your Total Rewards Summary in the Me@PwC app, which provides the target bonus ranges and impact tier distribution, as well as insight into the individual earnings potential across staff levels for your specific role. You will note that the tier distribution helps differentiate bonus decisions, so that people with greater impact receive a higher reward. Note: The Me@PwC app is for US staff only; this app is not available to US partners or interns, residents of Puerto Rico and Mexico, or US staff on international assignment. Funding of the bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Our bonus targets assume that Tax meets its financial goals, specifically, achievement of US Revenue Budget of $4.202B and US Contribution Margin Budget of $1.533B. Paying at, above, or below the bonus targets will be determined by whether we meet, exceed, or fall short of our financial goals. Remain focused on achieving your individual goals as outlined in the Goal Setting Placemat. Your differentiators in your Snapshots, combined with your performance metrics compared to your peers, will continue to be the key drivers in determining your impact in CRT. Demonstrating your digitization impact As illustrated in the goal setting placemats, we expect everyone to demonstrate his/her digitization impact and this will be one of the key elements in the Career Roundtable process. Digitization impact can take many forms -- including using a BOT/Alteryx workflow/Tableau visualization or enterprise wide technology, supporting your team in digitizing a process, creating your own automation, or monetizing new digital solutions for clients. Inputs to CRT discussions and decisions will include metrics on the usage of these tools along with the hours saved tracker, as well as your performance differentiators in Snapshots, to assess your digitization impact. So be sure to use the tools, capture your digitization impact story throughout the year (in Snapshots and through the hours-saved tracker), and encourage your team to do the same. Running our business We closed out Q1 on budget with 4% growth over prior year, and we expect to see even higher levels of growth in the second half of FY19 as we continue on our digitization journey. Your focus on our clients and the market is paying off, and your hard work is appreciated. A few things we should all be sure we are focusing on: Billings: We missed our billing goals every month in Q1. We know there are a lot of things you are asked to focus on each and every day -- but, bottom line, if we aren’t getting paid for our hard work, we aren’t running our business successfully. Please renew your commitment to ensuring we get invoices to our clients on a timely basis. Collections is another area where we need to improve. Often, all that’s needed is a simple reminder. A quick call to our client contact to confirm invoice payment is on track is a best practice. Daily Time Compliance: This is an easy area for us all to improve -- right now only 64% of Tax staff are compliant with daily time. Please ensure that you and your teams are in the habit of entering time on a daily basis. Need help? Engagement Margin: Our engagement margin is about 2 ½ points lower than this time last year. As we are removing hours, we should be reducing our cost of delivery and increasing margin. We need to concentrate on the basics around margin; managing our engagements and ensuring we are compensated for the entire value of our effort. Project 5 Million: Curious about our technology resources? Want to find everything you need to know about Project 5 Million? Visit our Project 5 Million Tax Source page. Hours Saved Tracker: Want to get recognized and rewarded for your efforts to digitize engagements? Track any and all time that you have digitized through our Project 5 Million Hours Saved Tracker.

Digital Lab: Digital Lab is going One Firm and will allow everyone to reimagine the possible. Individuals will be able to contribute, consume and co-create automations to make an impact on the firm and digitally upskill others. More to come... Digital Quests: Launching in November, completing these four real-life client scenarios will earn you the Digital Acumen knowledge badge, part of our new Digital Badging program. Our new tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool now has a social recognition activity feed, a mobile app for on-the-go recognition and redemption, enhanced dashboards and analytics for relationship leaders and the ability to provide monetary and non-monetary recognition. Remember, for those of you that have recognition budgets, we are loading budgets twice per year, so additional funds will be available in January. Read more in PwC Inside. Salesforce Since launch, Salesforce has created more visibility into client activity, driven better collaboration and increased our One Firm teaming. In this quarter alone, Tax has created approximately $4.2B new opportunities -- that’s 2% above the average number of opportunities created in the same time period last year!

One hour of misplaced or forgotten time might not seem like a big deal, but when thousands of us are off by a few hours, we can lose millions of revenue dollars and the resulting margin. This missing time also negatively affects our ability to manage our engagements and perform real-time forecasting. As a business, we make investment decisions every day based on the data and trends we see. We want the best possible data to make the right choices for our Firm. The exciting news is that we have a BOT to help you! The Mobile T&amp;E Entry BOT has been described as “awesome”, “impressive”, and “fantastic” and was developed to help us take care of the basics so we can focus on our clients and our development. This BOT accesses an easy-to-maintain Excel spreadsheet template and enters it into Mobile T&amp;E for you. Check out this recorded webex for detailed instructions. Numbers don’t lie -- this BOT has more than 2100 downloads and great reviews--so what are you waiting for? Download it now and make reporting your time daily easier! How to get started UI Path is required to use this BOT. Please refer to the install guide. Don’t forget to visit Digital Lab for more time-saving ideas. At this time, Digital Lab is available to PwC US &amp; Mexico Tax professionals and IFS Staff dedicated to supporting Tax. However, Digital Lab will be rolled out XLoS in the near future--communications forthcoming.

In a recent article, we encouraged you to continue having meaningful discussions with your clients about seven strategic business issues, including global trade implications. Trade is in the news every day as issues such as the following appear in the headlines: the newly reached United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal (revised NAFTA); the US trade war with China; negotiations with our EU partners; US sanctions related to Iran, Russia and North Korea; and US export controls violations. Not only is trade likely to be the next big disruptive issue, but it is also a huge opportunity for us to bring more value to our clients, who are trying to make sense of the many changes in North American trade policy and the impacts on their business. Many of our clients are pausing on large-scale changes. Even as they are still evaluating the gains from US tax reform, tariffs and trade wars are affecting their cost structures. This is why we should be talking to our clients about both tradeand US tax reform--recognizing this is a different conversation for our audit and non-audit clients. This is a prime opportunity for us to demonstrate our leadership and bring One Firm resources to help our clients understand and address the implications and opportunities. What you can do now We all need to educate ourselves about what this means for our clients. Here are a few things you should do to stay in the know: Invite your clients and attend our US-Mexico-Canada global trade webcast on USMCA (new NAFTA) on Nov. 1 -- and keep an eye out for the next webcast in the Global Trade series. Get to know the Global Trade Services team and learn how to start a discussion about global trade implications.

Activate your account today and start earning rewards! The new program is digitally enabled using a platform and app from our new vendor, Virgin Pulse. Here’s what you need to do to get started: Go to http://join.virginpulse.com/PwCWellBeingRewards_US to activate your account.

Connect your activity tracker to get credit for your steps, active minutes and sleep. Set your interests to get personalized daily tips to help you eat healthy, get active, reduce stress, increase focus, be more mindful, sleep well, and more. Program highlights As announced in April, this program will help us focus on well-being and supporting each other in making meaningful changes — and digitizing our firm — all in alignment with Be well, work well. Here are some of the features you’ll find with the new Well-Being Rewards Program along with some more detailed resources. We’re all in this together. Partners can join the program along with staff, so we can support each other and leverage team challenges to make it fun. Increased rewards. You can earn up to $500 in rewards each plan year (July 1-June 30). Lots more ways to earn rewards. Many new activities and behaviors related to sleep, mindfulness, team challenges, financial wellness, personal challenges and more will be eligible for reward points. For details, take a look at the user guide, program information sheet and FAQs. Motivational rewards structure. The new Well-Being Rewards Program brings a personalized, digital framework to encourage us to sustain healthy behaviors. The Virgin Pulse app provides motivational reminders and notifications to help you along the way. Tracking made easy. You’ll be able to track well-being behaviors on the go using the Virgin Pulse app. And, your wearable device can automatically sync with the platform. For details, take a look at the user guide. The more you do, the more you’ll earn. You’ll maximize the points you can earn by visiting the site each day. Each quarter, you have the opportunity to earn points toward achieving up to four levels and earning rewards. After the quarter is over, your points will reset to zero and you’ll start fresh in the new quarter earning points toward levels and rewards; you’ll keep whatever PulseCash you may have earned during the quarter. Review the program information sheet and FAQs to learn when and how you can earn points. New options for rewards. Similar to the current program, you’ll be able to redeem your points for gift cards or donate them to charity. You’ll also be able to redeem your points for merchandise or even deposit the cash directly into your bank account. Rewards earned under this program are taxable. You’ll receive an activation invitation from Virgin Pulse each Friday over the next month, if you have not activated your account. Well-Being Rewards for activities under the FY18 program Any activities that occur on or before June 30, related to the FY18 Well-Being Rewards Program, will need to be entered and redeemed through the current platform by July 13. If you have a reward balance of $10 or more and do not redeem your rewards by July 13, you will automatically receive a Premier Choice Award via email from Hallmark on July 17. You can redeem it for the same selection of gift card and charity options. Please note, you must have your Premier Choice Award email in order to claim your rewards. The new program is designed to promote engagement so the rewards structure and value assigned to activities will be different. On July 13, the current Well-Being Rewards Program app in PwC’s App Store will be disabled. If you downloaded this app, uninstall it from your iPhone/iPad. How can I get help and support? There are multiple ways to get help and support with the new Well-Being Rewards Program and platform.

PwC’s standard contract provisions are incorporated in the engagement letter templates found on the Engagement Letters Index, which have been approved by Tax Q&amp;RM and OGC. Standard key contract provisions are regularly updated to comply with changes in Firm policy or changes in tax law, regulations and ethical or professional standards. Accordingly, it is important to retrieve the template from the Engagement Letter Index when drafting the engagement contract to ensure you are engaging your client under the most recent terms and conditions. Any modifications to the standard terms and conditions in the engagement letter, including changes to the terms and conditions in a MSA, will require the approval of Q&amp;RM as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process. To obtain Q&amp;RM approval, mark “Yes” to question 2.1 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment and answer the questions that follow appropriately, providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Question 2.1 Terms &amp; Conditions Changes · Are you using a previously negotiated Engagement Letter or MSA that contains nonstandard terms (other than for terms expressly allowed at the engagement partner's discretion pursuant to Contract Guidance for Engagement Teams)? · OR Has the Client requested changes to standard Terms &amp; Conditions? · OR Does the client have a separate Confidentiality Agreement that does not conform to PwC Policy? ü Yes o No Each Engagement Letter or SOW issued under a MSA that contains nonstandard and/or changes to terms and conditions will require Q&amp;RM approval on the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment as part of the engagement set-up process. Certain provisions in our engagement letters (e.g., Scope of Our Services, Client Responsibilities, etc.) may be modified by engagement teams based on the specific client circumstances without further consultation or Q&amp;RM approval. A good reference for Tax engagement teams is the Engagement Letters: Contract Guidance, which provides guidance for evaluating proposed revisions or exceptions to our standard terms and conditions. It includes guidelines regarding what may be changed, what approvals are required, and provides suggested responses to frequently asked questions. For additional information regarding modifications to engagement letter templates and standard terms and conditions, see the Engagement Terms: Requests for Modifications policy. Contact any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions.

The Engagement Letter and Document Application Tax Q&amp;RM: Check it out! The Engagement Letter and Document Application (ELD) Tax Jan. 12, 2018 Creating an engagement letter is about to get simpler. The Engagement Letter and Document Application (ELD) is a new tool to automate the creation and execution of engagement letters, reducing the risk of non-standard or outdated engagement terms. The ELD is available for engagement teams to create, review and send engagement letters electronically to the PwC Partner or Principal and client for their electronic signatures. The ELD reduces the time engagement teams are spending on contracting and streamlines the review and signature processes. Engagement letters can be easily created and executed within hours of sending to the client. Engagement teams are able to track the status of their engagement letters in one convenient place. The ELD can be accessed via Engagement Center or the ELD stand alone application. Engagement letters created in Engagement Center will be automatically filed in the DMS project folder when fully executed letters are received back from clients. The most popular, general templates are now available for creation in ELD with more on the way for all the practice groups. The templates currently available for use are: · Tax Compliance – Corporate EL · Tax Compliance – Partnership EL · PFS Compliance EL · PTPA Compliance EL · Tax Consulting Services EL · Recurring Services EL with Statement of Work (SOW) · Statement of Work under Recurring Services · Master Limited Partnership EL (restricted to MLP practice) · Coming soon: Transfer Pricing, Corporate Executive Program and Specialized Tax Services (STS) letters The current version of the ELD handles letters where clients accept our standard terms. Upgrades for even more versatility are scheduled and suggestions are welcomed. To learn more, visit the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite on Tax Source for additional information and training videos on how to create engagement letters within Engagement Center and how to upload a custom Statement of Work (SOW) template in ELD. A shorter walk-through video on the review and signature processes is also available for PwC Partners and Principals on the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite. For further information contact Mike McDermott, or any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions.

In order to help engagement teams assess the permissibility of services, the Statements of Permitted Services ("SOPS") and US Independence Policy ("USIP") were drafted. The SOPS and USIP should be used to determine how to apply PwC’s Independence policies regarding non-audit services to be provided to restricted clients and related entities. In general, an Independence analysis utilizing the SOPS and USIP involves an evaluation of the Independence threats that may arise with respect to a particular service offering and related safeguards that, if implemented, may eliminate or reduce such threats to an acceptable level. All SOPS follow a standard format: · Section 1: What this SOPS Covers – describes the services or issues covered in the specific SOPS; · Section 2: Application of Global Independence Policy (“GIP”) – provides guidance on what is/is not permitted and/or what is permitted with safeguards for GIP restricted clients; · Section 3: Nature of the Independence Threat – provides an analysis of the main threats to PwC’s audit Independence that may arise from the services or issues covered by the SOPS; · Section 4: Safeguards – provides guidance as to safeguards that may be applied generally or in specific circumstances to mitigate identified risks to Independence; and · Section 5: Supplemental Guidance for SEC-Restricted Entities – provides guidance for SEC restricted clients that is additional to, or different from, the GIP requirements discussed in Section 2 and which must be followed when providing services to SEC restricted clients. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP provide guidance for SEC and AICPA restricted clients that is additional to, and occasionally different from, the guidance contained in the SOPS. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP should be reviewed in connection with the SOPS and followed when providing services to SEC and/or AICPA restricted clients. The following steps provide high-level guidelines on how to use the SOPS and USIP to perform an Independence analysis: · Action 1: Confirm that you have identified the appropriate SOPS for the proposed services (a user-friendly SOPS chart has been created and can be used as a starting point in any Independence analysis). · Action 2: If providing services to a SEC restricted client, start with Section 5 of the SOPS and Section 7200 of USIP to establish whether the proposed services are permissible per SEC guidelines. If not permissible, you will need to reconsider/restructure the service offering as SEC Independence rules do not permit the implementation of safeguards to eliminate or reduce threats to an acceptable level when providing services to a SEC restricted client. · Action 3: If the services are permissible with respect to a SEC restricted client or if the client is AICPA and/or GIP restricted (only), you must verify that the services are permissible per Section 7400 of USIP (for AICPA restricted clients) and/or Section 2 of the SOPS (for GIP restricted clients). · Action 4: If the services are permissible, determine the nature of the Independence threats as described in Section 3 of the SOPS and the corresponding safeguards to be applied as described in Section 4 of the SOPS. · Action 5: Once the Independence analysis has been documented, engagement teams must include the analysis along with the "Threats and Safeguards Analysis Form" in the "Relevant Policy and Threats and Safeguards" section of the AFS for approval by the CES Responsible Partner (and the AFS SoSRteam, where required). For additional information regarding permissibility, please visit the Independence microsite or contact any member of the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) team responsible for Tax risk issues with questions.

Not too long after the statement was uploaded, Experienced Tax Associate Travis Mercante took up the challenge. In less than two hours, Travis developed “The Scheduler” bot -- a solution that automates the steps required to draft or send multiple meeting invites at once by simply populating the required data fields in a spreadsheet. Once the information is entered, the bot takes care of the rest -- whether it’s meetings for a predefined time slot or based on the availability of the required attendees, or any other information that is required. With the scheduler bot, Kevin’s team was able to reinvest administrative time into focusing on our clients and driving even greater value -- plus the time savings resulted in higher engagement margin. For example, the team recognized a 1.7% improvement in margin on a fixed-fee $4.9M project for the multi-year Comcast NBCUniversal Sales &amp; Service Transformation from the hours saved. The Scheduler bot solution is currently being used by two teams and is in Digital Lab reviews so it can be scaled even more broadly with other teams soon.

In fact, the team recently had three of the top 10 contributors to Digital Lab —Ben Duva, Corey Merrill and Joe Sousa — and has scaled their learning by coaching other New York Metro-based teams about automated workflows. Applying what the team learned in the Digital Academy, the team also has made a significant impact on their engagements. They have developed automated solutions that have transformed the audit experience for the team and the client. Through collaboration across Core Assurance, Process Assurance and Digital Risk Solutions, they developed automated solutions that combine their knowledge of the client's business with the use of SQL and Python programming to test the interest expense and deposit balance rollforward for the full population of the client's US consumer deposit business, as well as to independently test the reconciliation logic for over 50 key reconciliations. The results are then automatically compared to client-generated results. These initiatives have resulted in over 200 hours of time savings for the team. In addition, the team is also using a workflow they developed to monitor staff availability and reallocate staff resources as needed. The workflow, TalentLink Workflow, takes a TalentLink export, filters for a specific list of jobs, determines the resources assigned to those jobs, summarizes the booked hours for each week and calculates the total available hours for each individual. It is usable on any job and has nearly 1,500 downloads from Digital Lab. “We have truly embedded technology enablement into our team culture,” says Joe Sousa. “Our approach has created efficiencies allowing us to spend more time engaging with the client on value-based insights and focusing on leveraging innovation to enable further audit efficiencies.” Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Malcolm Britton, Gavin Buckley, Spencer Crabtree, Ben Duva, Vinaykumar Jani, Corey Merrill, Brendan McGeown, Erica Silverman and Joe Sousa Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/21756.html</url><pwc_title>Your Tomorrow is here: Our top 7 Town Hall takeaways</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-07-13 20:30:49</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>/content/cq:tags/pwc/news-type/firmwide,/content/cq:tags/pwc/source/hq-news</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2017-10-13 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>pwc:source/hq-news</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Your Tomorrow is here: Our top 7 Town Hall takeaways Your Tomorrow is here: Our top 7 Town Hall takeaways HQ News Oct. 13, 2017 Our world is evolving, and PwC is evolving with it. As Tim Ryan explained during the firmwide Town Hall, PwC is taking a bold step into the future and responding to what the market (and all of you) are saying. We’ll bring the best of the firm to our clients with more value and a more digital experience, and we’ll build the skills we need to lead and thrive as our world changes faster than ever. This vision for the future has something for everyone -- from artificial intelligence to helping you better manage your energy, to winning some exciting prizes (iPhone X, anyone?). Check out our top takeaways, and the rest of this special edition of PwC Inside, to learn more about the topics that were discussed during the Town Hall. And if you missed any of these exciting topics due to the technical issues we experienced, the replay is ready for viewing. A new day begins with Your Tomorrow. Fresh from the Fall Partner Meetings, Tim shared an update on our FY18 strategy and introduced Your Tomorrow, our bold new effort that will revolutionize the way we work through the use of cutting-edge technology, while giving all of us the opportunity to build the skills we need to move forward into the future. Your Tomorrow is all about our investment in you -- providing you with growth opportunities, developing your digital skills, giving you the tools to maximize your energy and supporting your efforts to make an impact on the world around us. To help tie it all together, beginning today you’ll see this graphic in many of our PwC Inside stories, with the relevant piece of our strategy highlighted. Technology is changing the way we serve our clients. Assurance leader Maria Moats and Tax leader Roy Weathers each provided a glimpse into how Your Tomorrow will accelerate digitization and evolve the client experience -- from crowdsourcing application development within engagement teams in Assurance, to leveraging artificial intelligence to reengineer the way our Tax professionals work. We’re launching tools and benefits designed to make your life easier. The newly launched PwC App Store is now live on the iOS devices (e.g., iPhones, iPads) of our US partners and staff -- and with productivity and convenience apps like ScanBizCards, Packing Pro, FlightAware and the Wall Street Journal, there’s a lot to get to know and love. Got an app we should add to the new store? Submit your suggestion and you could win an iPhone X and other prizes! We’re also introducing a new identity theft protection benefit to help make sure your personal data remains secure. The service is free to all benefits-eligible PwC staff in the US, effective Nov. 1. Well-being is a team sport. Assurance Manager Matt Boncelet shared his team’s experience during the pilot for Be well, work well, which has now been rolled out to the entire firm. Be well, work well provides strategies that boost our energy by fueling our core needs across four dimensions -- mental, emotional, physical and spiritual. Be sure to look for more information in PwC Inside next week on how you can take the Energy Audit to see how you are managing your energy across all four dimensions. You can also download the Habit Bank app through the PwC App Store to get practical tips on how to energize yourself and your teams today. More information will be coming soon on a firmwide challenge to maximize our energy, so stay tuned! Find out what your Digital IQ is (then improve it). Partner Tom Puthiyamadam introduced our new Digital Fitness app, which provides a point-in-time assessment of your Digital IQ, and a personalized development plan to help you increase your score. Advisory Director Joe Harrington talked about the value of technical skills in the market, and provided practical tips on how each of us can begin to enhance our own Digital IQ, which starts by taking the assessment in the Digital Fitness app to understand your areas for development. The app will be rolling out by line of service to the firm starting next week, so watch for more information in PwC Inside -- and remember, it’s available externally and is a great example of PwC’s innovation at work, so don’t forget to share it with your friends, family and clients! You can change the world and build your professional skills at the same time. Tim announced that under our new Skills for Society initiative, we’ll have an impact on the biggest issues of our time so that we can all make a difference, grow and develop, and position ourselves -- and the firm -- for the future. We’ll pilot Skills for Society in FY18, as well as help young people prepare for the jobs of the future through our Access Your Potential commitment. Watch for more information coming soon on how you can weigh in on the societal issues where PwC people can make the greatest impact. We care about each other. From the monster storms that hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, to the earthquake in Mexico and other natural disasters, it’s been an incredibly difficult period for many of our colleagues who are still dealing with the aftermath of these events. When things got tough, our PwC family came through with over $1 million in donations -- which were matched by the firm -- as well as other means of support. And it’s not too late to help -- learn how you can get involved here. To access the webcast replay: Click on the following link to open the PwC Webcast Portal: https://webcastportal.pwcinternal.com.

Templafy is coming this week! Assurance June 25, 2018 As part of our Your Tomorrow strategy, we’re committed to digitizing and enhancing our tools for a more tech-enabled experience in Assurance -- all to help you work smarter and more efficiently. One way we’re doing that is by simplifying the preparation of audit committee reports with a new tool called Templafy. Curious? Watch this how-to video. Supported by PowerPoint, Templafy will make creating audit committee reports easier, giving you more time to focus on preparing for meetings to effectively deliver on areas most relevant to your clients and those charged with governance. Templafy will be pushed to your computer on June 29th, and lets you: Pre-populate your audit committee report template with engagement team and client specific information. Include board appropriate trending topics through a live feed of current thought leadership. Easily access firm approved libraries of images and infographics, if desired. Facilitate the roll forward of content in future reports. For more information, refer to ASM&amp;T Audit Alert 18/46. The launch of Templafy completes the third phase of ACRT. The previously released templates earlier this year ,which were accessible in Template Manager, are now in Templafy. Engagement teams are strongly encouraged to use this tool. Need a refresher on all of the updates and enhancements to the previously released templates? Watch this video.

Get up-to-date on our new travel and e Headed to a ‘high-dollar' city? Get up-to-date on our new travel and expense reimbursement policies US Finance Dec. 18, 2017 As we announced at last month’s firmwide webcast and in PwC Inside, we’re streamlining and simplifying our travel and expense reimbursement policies to protect the firm and our brand -- so it’s easier for all of us to do the right thing. The new policies take effect Jan. 1, 2018, barring any changes resulting from tax reform. (Please note: These changes apply to US partners and staff; guidance for Mexico and non-US SDCs will come separately.) What’s new since our last update? We’ve released the list of “high-dollar locations” that qualify for the $100 USD per day daily travel meal limit. Other highlights include: Meal expenses: You'll have more flexibility to manage meal expenses when you travel, with daily limits for out-of-town individual travel meals (including lunch and snacks). See below for details. Travel booking: We’ve simplified the travel booking process, so only in-policy options will be displayed in Concur Travel/Voyager (you’ll still have abundant choices for flights, hotels and car rentals). Mobile is coming: We’ll also launch a new, mobile-friendly expense system in spring/summer 2018. Compliance will be built into the front end, to help you prevent issues before they happen. FAQs: Our overview and FAQ documents on the Finance Spark site provide a quick way to get up to speed on the changes. Anything else? We’ve clarified and simplified our policies. Our refreshed documents provide specific guidance on topics such as what hotel expenses are reimbursable, travel for L&amp;D events, giving gifts to clients, and more. Read the policies here to learn more. What do you need to do? Always use the firm-approved Concur Travel/Voyager tool -- it’s cost-effective, and our Security and Travel teams can support you in case of emergency. Continue using the Mobile Expense system to submit expenses until our new system launches in spring/summer 2018 (more details to come next year). Get to know the new travel and expense reimbursement policies; they’ll be effective Jan. 1. Visit this Spark site for the detailed policies, plus an overview and FAQs. Still have questions? Join us Friday, Jan. 12 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ET for our next Q&amp;A session, where representatives from Finance, Travel and Ethics &amp; Compliance will again be on hand to answer your questions right here on Spark. Add a reminder to your Google Calendar (change your availability to “free” when you save).

A summer treat for your favorite cause: How about $10K? Responsible Business Leadership May 31, 2018 When PwCers are passionate about a cause, we go all out to make a difference. We see this every day on our crowdfunding platform, where our values come to life many ways. All year long, our people run fundraising campaigns for everything from child cancer research to veterans support services. Often, these causes are intensely personal, and, through the platform, friends and coworkers show up to support each other. The PwC Charitable Foundation is proud to encourage this dedication with the Flash Fund Fridays program. Since the first crowdfunding promotion in 2015, the Foundation has granted $320,000 to 42 charities supported by PwC people. Now, Flash Fund Fridays are back for the summer! From June 15 through the end of September, the Foundation will flash fund an eligible crowdfunder with a $10,000 grant every other Friday. Eligible crowdfunders will need to be active on the site during the campaign period and have a minimum of 15 PwC donors at the time of selection. If you have a cause or nonprofit you care about, this is a fantastic opportunity to take your support to the next level. Learn more about the promotion here and start yours today. Here’s what some of our past winners had to say about being a Flash Fund Fridays recipient: Shelley Townsend won a grant for Community Charter School Carolinas: “I love being able to help make the staff's lives easier so they can focus more on the children. The grant they received went to helping hire a new teacher assistant, as well as helping to pay for some of the general items that are needed on a daily basis.” Dennis Trunfio, a PwC partner sponsor of PwC's OPEN Circle Network, was excited to win a grant for The Trevor Project: “Abbe Land, executive director and CEO, was thrilled at the news of the grant, saying it ‘will make a difference in our ability to have LGBTQ youth reach out when they feel like no one else cares.’ Everyone at The Trevor Project was ‘speechless, but really happy’ and, in thanking every donor, said ‘know that we will be good stewards of your generosity and that your gifts really do make a difference.’” Wendy Campnell of Greater Chicago supported Okizu: “Okizu (a camp for families affected by pediatric cancer) relies on volunteers and donations to offer its services for free to everyone who attends camp. I am grateful to the PwC Foundation and my coworkers who generously donated money to help these kids and their parents find support and respite in the face of illness.” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/28036.html</url><pwc_title>Tax training completion requirements in FY18 for associates, seniors &amp; managers</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-30 08:39:23</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>/content/cq:tags/pwc/los/t,/content/cq:tags/pwc/source/tax</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>Check your Vantage Need to Do Tile for required FY18 courses.

The self-study series is required for Associates, Senior Associates and Managers and should be completed the earlier of 12 months of the courses being posted to your Vantage Need to Do Tile or promotion to the next staff class. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the expectation is for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility. Completion requirements: The series training should be completed within the timeframe specified. Promotions to the next staff level carry a Q&amp;RM training completion requirement in FY18, similar to the annual CPE requirement. For potential promotes, the courses are due no later than June 30, 2018 – don’t wait, plan ahead to ensure you are compliant!

The scholarship recipients are among the highest-performing of all US high school students as assessed by the prestigious National Merit Scholarship Program. Important reminder for parents of students who took the PSAT in fall 2017 This month, the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) will be notifying high school seniors through their schools if they qualify as a National Merit Semifinalist based on their fall 2017 Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT). Semifinalists will receive an application for further consideration to advance to Finalist standing. If you have a child who is a semifinalist, to be eligible for the PwC Foundation scholarship, it's important they note that their parent/guardian works for PwC in the parental employment section on the application. Winners will be notified by NMSC in March 2019. Questions about this program? Contact us_foundation@pwc.com Meet this year's PwC Foundation National Merit Scholarship recipients Please join us in congratulating the 18 children of PwCers -- a record! -- who qualified for the PwC Foundation's National Merit Scholarship for the 2018/2019 school year. This year’s Foundation scholars reflect the rich diversity of PwC people and offer a view into tomorrow’s workforce as they describe career interests ranging from AI and machine learning to biomolecular engineering and dentistry. Take a look: Julia Guo is majoring in computer science at Columbia University, where she developed an interest in machine learning during a summer study program. “I utilized logistic regression modeling and the R programming language to improve New York City's government-led Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise program,” said Julia, daughter of New York Advisory Manager Yunwei Guo. She is grateful for the Foundation scholarship because it lowers the financial burden of college, “lifting a weight off my parents’ shoulders and consequently mine. As first-generation immigrants from China, my parents have had to make endless sacrifices to give me a comfortable life and allow me to pursue my hopes and dreams through attaining a quality education.” Amanda Denning (center) is majoring in chemical engineering at Northwestern University in Chicago. “The scholarship will be a huge help to me in financing my education and ultimately doing what I want to do in life: Make a positive impact in the world by curing diseases,” said Amanda, daughter of Advisory Partner Brad Denning in Philadelphia. “I have a lot of school in front of me, and this scholarship will help me on my journey.” Jingyi Dai plans to study international relations at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. “This scholarship has decreased my financial burden, allowing me to focus on my education rather than its cost," said Jingyi, daughter of Tax Manager Wenjun Dai in Stamford. "By dedicating my time to studies rather than worrying about money, I will have a strong start to my college experience.” Chelsea Carver is majoring in biology at University of Pittsburgh, where she’s also accepted into the Honors Program and the Guaranteed Admissions Program for the School of Dental Medicine. “I chose this career path after becoming fascinated with the various dental procedures I experienced in my childhood," said Chelsea, daughter of Advisory Partner Thomas Carver in Pittsburgh. "I learned firsthand how dentists help improve their patients’ lives and the communities they serve.” Anmol Parande will major in electrical engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley. For Anmol, son of Chicago Advisory Partner Rajendra Parande, the scholarship “inspires me to continue working hard to build greater initiatives in the future.” Akshaya Venkata (in cap and gown) will major in chemical and biomolecular engineering at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. “This financial recognition gives me the morale boost to pursue my dream of finding a cure for cell-based degenerative diseases,” said Akshaya, daughter of IFS Director Venkata Thiagarajan in Tampa.

If you must use your PwC laptop and have issues downloading and installing TurboTax, contact PwC Technology for IT Support (see Questions section for contact options). Note: If you use your PwC laptop, you will likely need to contact PwC IT Support each time there is an update to TurboTax to allow the update to process on your laptop.

Once you purchase TurboTax Download software, use this special PwC URL https://tds.pwc.com/elke40/TurboTax/ and choose “States” to select the appropriate state files to download.

TurboTax Online allows you to prepare and file using your internet browser, while the Download software (also called Desktop) requires that you download software to your computer or purchase the CD to prepare and file your returns.

These entities are now required to file annual Forms 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business. For purpose of complying with this new obligation, U.S. disregarded entities will have the same taxable year as their sole foreign owner if their foreign owner has a U.S. income tax or information return filing obligation. If the foreign owner does not have a U.S. filing obligation, then the U.S. disregarded entity’s taxable year is the calendar year. Compliance teams may need to discuss this new filing obligation with their clients and assist such clients with this new obligation. Clients may need assistance with: (1) obtaining the required employer identification number ("EIN") necessary for filing the Form 5472; (2) filing a Form 7004 to extend the due date for the Form 5472; and (3) preparing the Form 5472 and a pro forma Form 1120. The IRS recently posted new guidance on its website with respect to filing the Form 7004 to extend the due date for these newly required Forms 5472. That guidance states: A foreign-owned U.S. disregarded entity ("DE") required to file Form 5472 can request an extension of time to file by filing Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns. The DE must file Form 7004 by the regular due date of the return. Because the Form 5472 of a DE must be attached to a pro forma Form 1120, the code for Form 1120 should be entered on Form 7004, Part I, line 1. "Foreign-owned U.S. DE" should be written across the top of Form 7004. For further general information, see the Instructions for Form 7004. The DE should send Form 7004 to: Internal Revenue Service 201 West Rivercenter Blvd. PIN Unit, Stop 97 Covington, KY 41011 Or, the DE can fax the form to (855) 887-7737. Caution: For these entities, do not use the regular filing address listed in the Instructions for Form 7004. Failure to comply with these new filing obligations can subject clients to significant penalties.

In January, Tim Ryan previewed changes including a simplified market and sector structure, and the redesign of our IFS functions. The changes to our market and sector structure go live on Monday. These changes are one of many ways our firm is changing and simplifying, so we can be more agile and responsive to our clients as their businesses change rapidly. By simplifying our market and sector structure, we’re also freeing up the time of some of our most experienced client service partners to focus on our clients. Our IFS functions are also moving forward with refreshed organizations and new ways of doing things. Here’s a reminder of what’s changing. Markets We’ve reduced the number of markets. Over time we expect these changes will make it easier to work together -- providing new career opportunities for our people and enhancing the quality and value we bring to our clients. As of Monday, your office won’t change, but the market you belong to will change for many. Click here for additional details on our updated markets leaders Sectors Industry developments have reshaped how our clients define themselves. Our new structure positions us to continue to deliver deep and relevant knowledge from across our sectors as our clients drive and adapt to change. Click here for additional details on our updated sectors structure and leaders Lines of service Our clients want and expect us to bring them the line of service capabilities, sector insight and market relationships that they value. To accomplish this, we work closely together across our firm. As we’ve restructured the markets and sectors, we’ve made corresponding changes to some line of service roles. You can find the updated line of service leadership teams through the links below. Assurance leadership Tax leadership Advisory leadership IFS redesign As we reimagine our business for the future, we’ve looked holistically across our IFS functions and service delivery model to make sure we have the right structure, programs, technology and processes in place to support our next phase of growth. Click here for an overview of the changes to some of our functions and what those mean to the way we work as a firm.

We all built our digital and energy management skills and made tremendous progress toward our Your Tomorrow goals to earn the entire week of July 4th off. And don’t forget: The challenge may be over, but Your Tomorrow goes on! Continue to take action by visiting the Habit Bank and building your Digital Fitness. It’s important not just for us as a firm, but for you and your career-- developing skills that will help us succeed at work and in life! And that’s a journey that never ends. With the week off, what will you do to celebrate? Here’s a sample of plans from our colleagues around the firm: Hazel Marie Alim: I’ll be camping at Yosemite National Park and hopefully hiking up to Half Dome and around Tuolumne Meadows. All of my camping and hiking gear for the trip was purchased with my Be well bonus. Umut Asikoglu: I am travelling to Thailand for a meditation retreat at the ancient Chiang Mai Temple. Thanks to the firm’s Be well bonus, I was able to make this dream trip a reality. Emitom Hillsman: I am flying to Iceland to take a road trip across the country. I am excited for the many wonderful sites to see and opportunities to relax. Mitzi Smith: In the words of Will Smith, “We’re going straight to the Wild Wild West.” My family will tour Tombstone, AZ, where we’ll visit historic sites, including the O.K. Corral, and watch entertaining reenactments. Geoffrey Bishop: Three of my colleagues (Munreet Nijjar, Irene Baba and Allison Samson) and I are traveling to the World Cup in Russia. We’re planning to use our Be well bonuses to buy additional swag and enjoy some nice meals while we are there! Lynn Marks: I’m having an eventful “staycation.” On July 4th, I’m running a 5k. Also planning to visit friends and start a major house renovation. Grateful to have the week off to unwind. Whether you’re taking an exotic trip, relaxing at home or giving back in your community, we want to see how you’re spending your break.

Monday is the start of a new chapter in how you access the news, data and resources you need. Introducing HQ and the new myMetrics: What to expect on June 10 When you open your myKcurve links, you will be redirected to the new HQ site. To offer the best experience, we will redirect any users visiting HQ in IE to Chrome. The new myMetrics is just one click away, in the top right corner of the HQ home page. The direct URL to myMetrics will remain the same. News will be regularly refreshed on HQ. You’ll now see personalized news for your LoS, Sector and Office/Location on the HQ home page. You’ll still receive the PwC Inside email on Tuesdays and Fridays. When you click into the new myMetrics, you’ll get high-level views into team performance, business metrics and pertinent job information, pulling data from more PwC systems and platforms than ever before. This is just the first release in an exciting roadmap of features and personalized content we’ll continue to roll out, so stay tuned for more information.

Core to our Continuous Improvement efforts, we’re making these tools simpler and more intuitive. Plus, they’ll be mobile-enabled, so you can access them on the go. Before these tools go live, how can you prepare?

We’re transitioning to the new systems now to minimize disruptions to you and your team, as August is the slowest time of year for these tools. We’ll share more in the coming weeks in PwC Inside and on HQ. Take the following actions by August 8: Initiate, submit and/or approve AFSs to avoid delays due to system disruptions. This will ensure your ability to serve clients is not impacted while the legacy systems are down to prepare for go-live of the new tools. Please note: If you have an urgent need during the shutdown of AFS, a workaround process will be available here. This process is intended to be accessed for exceptional cases only. Ensure your client hierarchies are up to date. CES will be read-only beginning August 9 through August 18.

HQ is your new front door to firmwide and LoS news, tools and resources, and the new myMetrics has been revamped to deliver even more meaningful insights about our clients and people. How to make the most of your new digital workplace: Check out these features on HQ... Intuitive, mobile-friendly navigation Customizable “Quick Links”, pre-populated based on your role, or select your own by clicking on “Edit Links” and visiting HQ’s Link Index. A personalized news feed on your homepage, prioritized by LoS, sector and office/location. (You’ll continue receiving our PwC Inside email each Tuesday and Friday, and can now get additional news in between sends by checking HQ throughout the week.) Key Dates that are easy to add to your Google calendar. Streamlined search to access HQ news and content. Find Fathom search through Quick Links, Managed Bookmarks and Chrome extension. Visit PwC’s App Store to download our mobile-friendly and responsive PwC HQ app. More information, tips and tricks in these FAQs. And access the new enhancements in myMetrics... Check out this video and the myMetrics Spark page for FAQ documents, how-to videos and more. "By the Numbers" widget on the home page keeps you up to date on the data most important to you (click the cog icon or the plus sign to customize). My Profile features important information about you, like your Snapshots, AmEx balance, vacation and holidays. My Team offers Coaches, Relationship Leaders and Connectivity Partners important information on the people they manage. My Business helps client-facing individuals manage their engagements and stay informed on key client updates and trends. Applications features an inventory of firm applications and dashboards. The new myMetrics is available on desktop and tablet only for now (mobile phones will be supported in the future). Download the new myMetrics app for iPad in the PwC app store today. This is just the beginning — your input will help inform future releases. Let us know what you think of HQ and myMetrics so that we can continue to improve these sites and simplify the way we work.

Core to our Continuous Improvement efforts, we’re making these tools simpler and more intuitive. Plus, they’ll be mobile-enabled, so you can access them on the go. Before these tools go live, how can you prepare? From August 9 to August 18, there will be intermittent, short-term disruptions to the availability and functionality of AFS, CES, Rapid Engage, Astro and Independence Checkpoint. Explore our AFS/CES guidance for more information on what to do during this period, along with the resources available to you. We’re transitioning to the new systems now to minimize disruptions to you and your team, as August is the slowest time of year for these tools. We’ll share more in the coming weeks in PwC Inside and on HQ. Take the following actions by August 8: Initiate, submit and/or approve AFSs to avoid delays due to system disruptions. This will ensure your ability to serve clients is not impacted while the legacy systems are down to prepare for go-live of the new tools. Please note: If you have an urgent need during the shutdown of AFS, a workaround process will be available here. This process is intended to be accessed for exceptional cases only. Ensure your client hierarchies are up to date. CES will be read-only beginning August 9 through August 18. Pre-clear your personal investments in Independence Checkpoint if you’re planning to make changes to your or your immediate family members’ personal investments. Still have questions?

We work with well-known authors to write short and engaging books that are then distributed across libraries, prisons, colleges, hospitals and adult-learning organisations. They are also available in bookshops across the country. Since 2006, over 100 Quick Reads titles have been published; the books have been loaned more than 5 million times through libraries and over 4.8 million books have been distributed. The initiative has established a reputation for publishing top quality bestselling authors, including Andy McNab, Jojo Moyes, Jeffrey Archer, Malala, Roddy Doyle and many more. 2018's brilliantly varied list featured books by Dorothy Koomson, Tammy Cohen, Kit de Waal, Vaseem Khan, Mark Billingham and Fern Britton. This year, after announcing we had been unable to secure financial support to keep the scheme going, we were stunned to receive an incredible gift from best-selling author Jojo Moyes (Me Before You), who generously offered us three years of funding for Quick Reads. The money will allow us to continue the scheme and relaunch a new and improved list of Quick Reads in 2020.
