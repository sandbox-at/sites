He recently completed a pro bono project with the San Francisco Police Department that brought our purpose -- to build trust in society and solve important problems -- into focus. Here’s more from Mukund: Tell us about this project and the problem you were trying to solve. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), like many around the country, is going through a lot of change as they work to build stronger relationships with the community they serve. They’re grappling with whether they have the right diverse makeup on their force, whether they’re applying the right principles of when to use force, how they are addressing issues of bias and challenges related to homelessness, etc. They went through a Department of Justice audit a year and a half ago, and the findings required some changes in policies and process, including the need for strategic planning, which hadn’t been done in more than 10 years. We were connected with the Department through CivicBridge, a program run jointly by the SF Mayor’s office for public/private partnerships and a PwC alumnus who worked in the Mayor’s office. It was a quick project -- three months for “Strategy 1.0” that would identify their strategic priorities for the next three to five years. PwC’s purpose was a part of our conversations from the beginning, as at its core, the problem SFPD is trying to solve is the need to build trust with its constituents while continuing to keep the city safe, at a time when police-community relations are becoming more and more strained. What about your work brings you a sense of fulfillment/pride? This project put all the things I love about being a consultant front and center. I do a lot of strategic planning, but this was different: sitting in focus groups with cops, and hearing about the types of problems they’re facing, was very real. I’ve never worked on something that impacted my own life so directly -- I live in San Francisco, as does much of the team, so doing something that directly makes my own community better was very different for me. The SFPD now has what they need to move forward and think through long-term strategy. Hopefully, everyone in San Francisco will see the benefit of that. What role does trust play in your relationships? As consultants, we come to listen, with no agenda. We establish trust by virtue of being neutral outsiders. Even though the core PwC team had no law enforcement background, the SFPD trusted us to help think through what they need and what their stakeholders are expecting of them. Our project governance structure also included an outside stakeholder group (members of the community), which was much more skeptical, so we worked hard to understand their perspective and, over time, built trust and allowed them to open up to the team with their concerns and priorities. We also relied on internal resources (e.g., PwC’s Safe and Smart Cities Initiative), as well a significant amount of external research, to bring an outside-in point of view. What aspects of your role do you enjoy most? Problem solving, for sure. I’m grateful for the kind of reach we have as a firm to get involved in these types of rare opportunities. Consulting as a model gives you the setup and PwC has the brand -- people want to hear from us on how to best approach their problems and that gives us access. It shows the level of trust people place in us and allows us to have greater, more meaningful impact. The PwC team who worked on this engagement included Igor Belokrinitsky, Kristin Centanni, Kristin Craig, Sierra Hawthorne, Elaine Liu, Keith Lucken, Ken Lund, Kendall McCarthy, Richa Mohan, Helen Petersen, Mukund Srirangapatnam and Martin Wan.

Penalty assessments can be costly. Know Filing a tax return extension? Penalty assessments can be costly. Know the deadlines One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 31, 2019 With tax filing season upon us, it remains important that engagement team members are aware of the changes in due dates for certain tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015 and how those due dates impact our clients. It is also important that we collaborate with our clients regarding the importance of obtaining timely extensions and filing their tax returns on time. This communication is being issued as part of an ongoing effort to remind engagement teams of the revised due dates for certain tax returns, now entering into the third filing season for which such due dates are applicable, and the steps you can take with clients to reduce the instances of penalties for late-filed returns, missed extension requests, etc. Clients may not be aware of the penalties for failure to file timely returns, or understand the time involved or the challenges associated with obtaining timely extensions. Clients also may not appreciate that penalty abatement is not automatic. Based on recent experience, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain abatement of penalties. To avoid the unpleasant, and potentially costly, surprise of a penalty notice, engagement teams should discuss with clients the importance of establishing clear responsibilities for obtaining timely extensions and, if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions, ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting the responsibilities with your clients before extensions are due is an important part of managing this important aspect of engagement execution. For additional information regarding changes in due dates, click here. PwC’s Tax Controversy and Regulatory Services (TCRS) group and OFRO Tax have published the guidance below regarding the importance of extensions and related best practices. Please read the guidance and continue to collaborate with your clients around this important aspect of our client service. If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact a member of TCRS or OFRO Tax. Thank you for your efforts in serving clients and representing the firm. * * * * * * OFRO Tax and PwC’s TCRS group continue to assist engagement teams with requests for abatement of penalties assessed on late-filed returns. While most extensions are timely e-filed or paper-filed, TCRS is seeing penalties assessed in part because: When preparing to e-file an extension, the person responsible for ascertaining that the extension is accepted by the IRS mistakenly believes the extension has been e-filed when, in fact, the final act of “sending” or “transmitting” the extension never took place (e.g., “pushing the button” did not take place) or the IRS did not accept the extension. Roles are not effectively communicated when PwC e-files some extensions and prepares a paper copy of other extensions for filing by the client. The client believes PwC has e-filed an extension when, in fact, PwC has sent a paper extension to the client for mailing to the taxing authority. When filing a paper extension by mail, the person submitting the extension believes that it is timely mailed by generating a mailing label using “SimpleCertifiedMail” or by merely dropping it off in the mail room, when extra steps should be taken to ensure it is processed timely to the U.S. Post Office so there is no risk that the extension would not be considered timely. For both new and existing clients, the party responsible for e-filing or paper filing the extension is not clearly identified before the due date for filing the extension. Lack of awareness regarding new due dates for certain tax returns. Recommendations Engagement teams should collaborate with our clients regarding extensions as part of the engagement process. Those discussions should include the importance of obtaining timely extensions and, if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions, engagement teams should ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting in writing the responsibilities with your clients before the due date for filing the extension is an important aspect of such client collaboration. To avoid the unpleasant surprise of an IRS penalty notice, clients and PwC engagement teams should make a concerted effort to discuss the following before the due date for filing the extension: Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for preparing the extension (does the engagement letter with the client discuss responsibility for preparing and submitting the extension?); Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for e-filing or paper filing the extension; Who at the client or at PwC will obtain proof of timely filing of the extension (g., an electronic confirmation from the IRS that the extension was accepted; a copy of the U.S. Certified Mail – return receipt form; or a tracking number from one of the private delivery services listed in IRS Notice 2016-30); and Who at the client or at PwC should provide proof to the other party of timely filing of the extension prior to the original due date? This step of providing proof of the filing of the various extensions prior to the original due date can be an essential step in helping to ensure that all extensions have been properly filed – like other aspects of engagement execution this process should have four-eyes review and appropriate partner involvement. No extension request should be considered as having been filed until proof of filing is obtained. The reviewer on the engagement should ensure that proof of filing on, or preferably before, the statutory deadline for timely filing an extension request (i.e., original due date of return) has been saved in the DMS tax file. Best Practice Suggestions Review the revised statutory due dates for certain tax returns. In light of changes to the due dates for certain tax returns, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015, familiarize yourself with the new due dates as they will impact the time period for requesting extensions. For additional information on the new due dates, click here. To the extent you have any questions about the new dates, please consult with a member of the TCRS group (for federal tax matters) or a SALT SMS (for state and local tax matters). Review the e-Filing Procedures With Your Team. We have heard from a number of engagement teams that, after receiving the extension communication in prior years, team members met to review the steps required for e-filing extension requests, and the procedures for confirming that the taxing authority accepts extension requests. We encourage you to consider discussing extensions and e-file procedures with your team members in an effort to mitigate the risk of missed extensions. Review the Extension Form. Review the extension form to ensure that all required information is included in the extension and that all questions and boxes have been appropriately addressed. Proof That an Extension Has Been Successfully e-Filed. After electronically transmitting the extension to the IRS or state tax agency, you should receive an acknowledgement showing the status of the extension. Typically, the software used to e-file an extension generates an “acceptance” receipt from the IRS. A receipt that contains the status as “Accepted” is proof that the IRS accepted the form. If the receipt contains the status as “Acknowledged,” it is not proof that the IRS accepted the form. Similarly, a spreadsheet that aggregates information on multiple extensions for a particular client is not proof that the IRS accepted a particular extension form. Please discuss with your compliance team the procedures to obtain verification that the electronic transmittal of the extension was “Accepted” and the timing for performance of these procedures. There is a similar process with those state revenue departments that require or permit e-filing. Proof That a Paper Extension Has Been Mailed Timely. In some cases, PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and is authorized by the client to mail the extension to the IRS or state tax agency on behalf of the client. Familiarize yourself with the mailroom’s delivery times. Where possible, time sensitive filings should be delivered directly to the U.S. Post Office main window so that proof of acceptance by the U.S. Post Office (e.g., Certified Mail receipt stamped by the U.S. Post Office) is obtained. If you are using SimpleCertifiedMail to create mailing labels, there is a risk that the non-USPS receipt may not be sufficient to establish timely filing. In order to avoid any risk, you should ensure that you have an acceptance scan from the U.S. Post Office on that same date. Although recent case law has allowed the use of a non-USPS receipt date to govern timely filing, there is still an added risk and the above guidelines should be followed. File an Extension Even If No Tax Due for Year. A tax return that reports a net operating loss, or no tax liability, can still lead to significant penalties being assessed if the return is not timely filed (e.g., returns filed late with Forms 5471, 5472, 8865, etc. attached). File an extension even if the return is expected to report no tax liability for the year. File Extensions Early. An extension can be filed any time after the end of the tax year and before the original due date of the return for that year. A calendar year taxpayer may file an extension as early as January 1 of the following year. An extension may be filed without a payment, so long as the tax liability for the year is stated on the extension correctly. A corporate taxpayer’s reasonably estimated tax liability, however, must be paid on or before the due date of the return, excluding extensions. When in Doubt, Call the IRS. The IRS does not notify taxpayers that an extension request has not been filed. If you are unsure of whether an extension is on file with the IRS, you may contact the IRS practitioner priority line at (866) 860-4259. You must have a Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, ready to fax to the IRS if your authorization is not already on file with the IRS. Due Date Has Passed and No Extension Was Filed. If the due date for filing the extension has passed, please consult with TCRS immediately. In the event that an extension was missed, a return was filed late, or penalties were assessed for the late filing of a return, please consult with TCRS and a Regional OFRO Tax Partner in accordance with our policy on Troublesome Practice Matters. Additional Discussion In various situations, our clients believe they, or PwC, filed a timely: Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns; Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return; or Form 8868, Application for Extension of Time To File an Exempt Organization Return. A client may have PwC assist with filing an extension in several ways, including: PwC is engaged to e-file the extension with the IRS on behalf of the client; PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension, and then mails the extension to the client for the client to file with the IRS; PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and mails the extension to the IRS on behalf of the client. If the IRS determines that the return is untimely because there is no extension on file with the IRS, penalties may be assessed under IRC sections 6651(a)(1) and 6651(a)(2) for failure to file a timely return and failure to pay tax timely. However, the largest penalty assessments TCRS is seeing are for late international information returns. Under an automated program, the IRS assesses: a $10,000 civil penalty for each late filed Form 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect To Certain Foreign Corporations; and a $25,000 civil penalty for each late filed Form 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business. Upon examination, the IRS may also assert additional delinquency penalties associated with other international information returns (e.g., Forms 8865, 8858, 926) that are not filed timely. States may impose similar penalties. These penalties are assessed whether or not the taxpayer has an income tax liability associated with the tax return. Additionally, late-filed original returns also may jeopardize the validity of tax elections that must be made on a timely filed original return.

Lab notes: Automate your Mobile Time — bot seriously! HQ News Jan. 28, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Time entry is tedious and time-consuming -- but also an important part of how we run our business. Thanks to Digital Lab, you can now enter your time in seconds. Tuan Nguyen, from the Automation Center of Excellence team, and others have developed a bot to eliminate the daily search for WBS codes and descriptions, saving time and stress around this everyday compliance. We talked to Tuan to learn more about the Mobile Time Entry bot. PwC Inside: How did you come up with the idea for the Mobile Time Entry bot? Tuan: I wasn’t familiar with technology like UiPath before I joined the firm. It was a hobby at first, since in compliance-heavy accounting, you never thought you could use bots. But now, being on the robotics team, I see what a great opportunity we have to be on the cutting edge. Entering time is a pain point. There are so many codes and it can take upwards of a half-hour of non-chargeable time per day. So, when UiPath came out, the Innovation team knew this was something we wanted to use bots to solve for. And now, even if you are only saving five minutes a day for one person, that’s 80,000 hours a year across the firm. What has the feedback been? We’ve already iterated several versions, based on feedback. The first version was based on code descriptions and took a while initially to set up, so we worked with others to build up the capabilities. You no longer have to enter in names and other fields -- you only need the code, and the bot will automatically pull in the other info. We also created a tutorial demo video, to provide foolproof instructions for getting started. And based on feedback from our colleagues in Mexico, we created a separate version for their time. Were there challenges? Even though entering time is a common task across the firm, we realized through Digital Lab that everyone completes their time differently. Some people have long lists of codes, some only have one or two; some people have to use descriptions, some have more specific codes to include as identifiers. After collecting feedback for all of these scenarios we had to solve for, we made improvements. But the personal challenge has been taking constructive criticism well. Automations become your baby. You get protective of changing them, but you always have to keep the end user in mind. If they aren’t happy using it, why did you make it? So, I value the one- or two-star ratings more than the five-star. Have you submitted anything else to Digital Lab? I am co-author on several submissions. I help teams with the initial process map and proof of concept while they get upskilled, and then they take on testing and making updates, which is really rewarding. Do you know how you will use your Digital Lab rewards? Anytime I get Real-time recognition or other rewards, it goes straight to my wife. So I guess it depends on what she wants.

While most of us can only yell at the screen, a few PwCers know what it’s like to experience the game as a player. Jordan Bond, Kyle Doughterty and Gabe Knutson played for the University of Louisville men's team, Villanova University women's team and Lehigh University men's team, respectively, and each made it to the NCAA tournament. Besides picking up expert dribbling and shooting skills, they all also say that playing competitive college sports has helped them develop skills that we all need to be successful. Time management Kyle, a senior associate, says the time management skills she picked up while balancing academics and athletics in college are incredibly helpful at work. “It’s important to have set times to focus on different things and to be able to transition between different activities,” she said. Gabe, also a senior associate, added that it’s crucial to “develop a balancing system that works for you.” What might work for one person will not necessarily work for someone else. Responding to feedback Jordan, an experienced associate, says being coachable has been helpful in his career. “Every day on the job I’ve found that I’m being coached. You kind of have to be a sponge and be receptive. You have to understand that you don’t know everything and can always learn more.” Teamwork and collaboration Teamwork and collaboration are critical on and off the court. Jordan points out that “you have to recognize everyone’s strengths and weaknesses and see where you can add value.” Part of this teamwork is self awareness, shares Kyle. She says it’s important to “know what you bring to the table and what you’re good and not so good at. The things you’re good at, you should take the initiative and lead, and learn from others regardless of what level they are.” Gabe, Kyle and Jordan have continued playing basketball since joining PwC — they’ve each been a part of the US team in the annual PwC international basketball tournament and have played on different recreational teams. As for their brackets, Gabe and Jordan are both rooting for Michigan State on the men’s side. Kyle is hoping the University of Connecticut wins the women’s trophy.

FLEX is continuously improving: come see what's new (and fixed)! Tax May 30, 2019 Over the past year we’ve rolled out a number of key enhancements to FlexForecast, our budgeting and estimate to complete (ETC) tool: We’ve integrated with TalentLink - a significant advancement in operational efficiencies — creating an automated connection between demand and supply and allowing insight into our staffing needs like never before. We’ve upgraded functionality for the budgeting &amp; ETC screens for an enhanced user experience. We’ve implemented the ability to enter ETC hours and rates by person, providing us with a greater level of accuracy in our ability to forecast and manage the business. And we’ve been continuously designing new enhancements, as well as integration with other firm systems to create an operationally efficient experience for you, our engagement teams — all while working to onboard the Assurance LoS to make Flex a truly xLoS tool. The speed at which we’ve made these enhancements has also presented some challenges. As more and more gets built into the tool, its performance has taken a hit and has not consistently operated at the level that we expect of a tool that is so critical to the management of our business. We understand the frustration from a user experience perspective, particularly for those of you who are budgeting and managing large, complex projects and we are working diligently to identify the root cause of these issues and resolve them as quickly as possible. Multiple fixes have been released over the past two weeks, so you should already be seeing improvements. A maintenance period will now be in place every night between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. ET to help stabilize the system during the day. This is temporary, and we will continue to release additional updates as remaining issues are resolved. We ask for your patience as we get Flex operating again like the exceptional tool that it is. In the meantime, please reach out to your Tax PM Drivers with any questions or concerns.

As infinite learners, we’re using digital technologies and modern approaches through these hubs to take our development to the next level. The hubs structure and guide Advisory professionals’ development at their staff level. x-Advisory Development Hubs are currently available for associates and managers. Hubs for senior associates and directors will be available in January 2019. The x-Advisory Development Hub for Associates helps associates understand our business, expand their networks, develop the core consulting skills necessary for success and deepen their technical knowhow -- all building blocks to help establish them as PwC professionals. The x-Advisory Development Hub for Managers provides an easy place to find the critical information and helpful resources managers need to be successful. It has been ordered so that each section builds on the one before it, so it’s recommended that managers navigate the content in sequential order. (For managers who have attended, or are currently attending, the xLoS Leadership Pathways program for managers, the Advisory technical curriculum you receive is the same as the customized curriculum you will find in the hub. Whether you complete the training through the hub or Leadership Pathways, your completion will be recorded in both curriculums. ) Senior associates and directors, be on the lookout for information about your x-Advisory Development Hubs coming soon.

Yet this experience remains invisible to many of us. To help shed light on this dimension of diversity and learn ways we can all become allies for disability inclusion, our Professionals With Disabilities Network is hosting a panel discussion webcast Oct. 16 at 1 p.m. ET (Add to calendar). Moderated by Diversity and Inclusion Managing Director Jennifer Allyn, the discussion will include panelists Rob Rusch, Tax manager; Milan Shah, Assurance partner; and Julia Taylor Kennedy, co-author of the Center for Talent Innovation “Disabilities and Inclusion” research report. We believe bringing together people with diverse perspectives — including individuals with disabilities — is a business imperative to spur innovation, drive growth and help us solve important problems in new and creative ways. This commitment to building an inclusive team is part of the reason we’ve been recognized for our efforts by the National Organization on Disability as a Leading Disability Employer.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Update: Since this writing, Ed has worked with the Creative team to update the Digital Story site, and helped raise awareness of new Digital Lab features through live events in several offices. The team also provided eye-catching visuals to help us celebrate our New Partners and Promotion Day earlier this summer, and are working on FY20 Strategy priorities. Look for their award-winning visuals and videos on your devices and in the offices — and take another look at Ed’s interesting story! Name, rank, serial number? I'm Ed Trenn, a senior manager on the US Creative Team, based out of Washington, D.C. I’ve been with the firm for almost 27 years. What's a typical day for you? I work closely with our Marketing &amp; Sales, Internal Communications &amp; Change and External Communications teams on everything from videos to web pages to multimedia ad campaigns. As an account manager, I help them plan for every communication channel and suggest ways to achieve a “wow” factor. It’s very rewarding; they share their vision with me, then I get together with my colleagues on the Creative Team to figure out how to bring it to life! How did your journey lead you to this role? It’s certainly been an evolution! I was only the second graphic designer hired in the Washington, D.C., office. This was back before email and direct deposit! I designed printed proposals and oral presentations with 35mm slides, but got exposure to the internet and computer graphics when those were in their infancies. Within a few years, I moved to the group that later became Advisory and then to Brand as a project manager helping designers with content development. And now, account management for the US Creative Team. How does your team bring value to PwC? We listen to our customers. A good example of this is when we design the artwork and graphics for Promotion Day for all markets. We realize that every market differs in size and scope, and we dedicate ourselves to making sure there's proper scalability -- so every office feels like they are directly connected to the campaign. Making our clients happy is key; creating this year's emoji campaign brought a lot of smiles to a festive occasion! Overall, we're constantly learning and using new technologies and techniques for a wide variety of channels -- whether in a PwC office or at a sports arena. A good example of this is our Digital Story, which uses animation and web content to bring our journey to life. What might we be surprised to learn about you? I know American Sign Language. A deaf friend of mine moved to Washington, D.C., from Italy and needed help with his English while working on his Ph.D. I learned how to sign to better communicate with him. He's repaid my help with the use of his condo near Rome! Travel goes hand-in-hand with my love of old cars, too. I buy them, fix them up and go to car shows with my car club. So far we’ve been to events and museums in England, Holland and throughout the US. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story!

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Julie Huske, a director in the Chief Data Office. I’m based in Chicago and have been with the firm for eight years. What's a typical day for you? I lead a team that brings new technology to PwC and teaches our people how to use it. We drive innovation across the firm in data analytics and automation. We built the strategy and Digital Academy training programs that teach our people how to use today’s hottest tools to help their clients -- whether internal or external. You’ll often find me researching new tools, facilitating training sessions or connecting dots so those people we’ve trained can help train others. How did your journey lead you to this role? I began as a chemical engineer in the pharma industry and later joined PRTM as a consultant. Much to my surprise, PwC acquired PRTM in 2011! My team sits in the Chief Data Office, where we focus on connecting our people -- IFS and client service -- with their data through the use of tools like Alteryx, Tableau, PowerBI, UiPath, Digital Lab and DataRobot. My love for data allowed me to pilot the Data Analytics Academies and Data Ninja programs that are now being scaled through the Your Tomorrow Digital Academies, where we’re upskilling tech learning for anyone in the firm. I love making our people’s lives easier through innovative tools! How does your team bring value to PwC? We’re committed to helping PwC staff enhance their technical acumen so they can better navigate the new data-driven future, leveraging tools like Digital Hub for more resources and Digital Lab for ready-built applications. We help our people learn things like how to tell a story with data and how to make processes run more smoothly and save time. Teaching anyone who’s game to learn truly brings us joy -- and we stay connected with them as they continue along their knowledge journey. What role does teaming play in your success? We’re very supportive of one another, inside and outside the office. And we have a lot more in common than our mutual love for data! Everyone on our team has children -- one of us is even a grandmother. Our solid network empowers us to be leaders in what we do. We find ways to get the work done as a team, whether virtually or in person. Since we’re often traveling separately and working remotely, we use the Academies as a chance to connect in person to maximize the time we have together. I’m also a firm believer in having fun at work -- and our team certainly does! Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story!

Tampa-based IT Director Sean Boyette has been with PwC for 20 years -- and with the military, as a National Guardsman, for 26. He describes himself as having a dual dedication to both PwC and the military. "It's like having parallel careers; they really complement each other," he said. Sean's also one of only a few to achieve Lt. Colonel in the National Guard in the state of Florida. A born leader, he's overseen numerous military initiatives as well as IT teams here at PwC. He's found a way to blend the two distinct career paths by staying active in the firm's Veterans Affinity Network (VAN). "My interest in VAN began during one of my deployments," he explained. "The firm's VAN members sent care packages to my unit; I was very impressed." Along with his fellow VAN members, Sean supports charitable causes like Run for the Fallen, and places flags and wreaths on tombstones at local federal cemeteries each December for Wreaths Across America. "We look forward to that every year," he said. Sean is also passionate about helping VAN with recruiting. "We figure out how a veteran’s military skills can best converge with PwC,” he said. “And, once they're here, we help them translate their knowledge to a business mindset, in a way that's useful to them and the firm." He's also an advocate for impacting and supporting his local veteran community. "We hold lunches for our Florida VAN members and local veterans. It's a great way to reconnect, reminisce and meet new members." From Lt. Colonel to Colonel On August 3, members of VAN, along with his wife and three children, will be on hand to support Sean as he participates in a "Chain of Command" ceremony, an important step before promotion to Colonel. "I am fortunate,” he said. “I couldn’t have done it without the support of my PwC colleagues.” After Colonel he aspires to be promoted to General. To do that -- and there are only five Generals in the state of Florida -- he needs to achieve a certain level of education for a certification of eligibility; he's currently taking classes to reach that next goal. "At PwC, it's possible to have a parallel career if you are in the military, thanks to the firm's flexibility,” said Sean. “Not every organization offers such support. I appreciate the overwhelming encouragement I received from the moment I came here; I’m proud to serve my country and support PwC." Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

Source: "Medical Billing." Healthcare Business &amp; Technology, 2019 The business challenge Healthcare coding (transforming healthcare diagnosis, procedures, medical services and equipment into universal medical alphanumeric codes) is complex with challenges that can negatively impact health organizations—think inaccurate reimbursements, heavy fines and legal issues. With ever-changing regulations and compliance rules, healthcare coding continues to be a sore spot for Health Information Management (HIM) departments, CFOs, coders, and reviewers. The SMART solution PwC’s SMART® increases the efficiency and effectiveness of inpatient and outpatient coding quality evaluation processes and ensures quality and compliance review. With 25+ years in the market, including clients like Ascension, Banner, and Northwell, SMART is built on decades of coding and billing process work resulting in the most extensive business rules in the market. The SMART difference SMART benefits 35% Avg. cases flagged for review 100% Cases evaluated 8-12% Diagnosis-related group (DRG) change rate $2000 Avg. net impact per case SMART was a critical component of process redesign that directly contributed to improving our Health Systems Healthgrades scores. By utilizing daily focused coding assessments and education, we also enhanced our overall coding and documentation practices.

Without a free lunch program, they may not have enough food; without a school building, they may not have a safe place to go; without a teacher’s guidance, they may not stay engaged in learning. The long break can lead to what’s known to educators as “summer brain drain.” This can most negatively impact students from underserved communities, who may not have access to additional help (tutors, after school programs, etc.) to catch up come September. According to the National Summer Learning Association, when the school year ends, children in high-poverty environments struggle not only with basic needs, but also with losing precious time during the summer months to continue their learning. The cumulative effect is a crisis in the making: By the fifth grade, summer learning loss can leave low-income students almost three years behind their peers. These are the kids we’re committed to supporting through Access Your Potential. So this summer, we’re making sure that fun and learning aren’t mutually exclusive by bringing our tech and money curriculum to where students will already be spending their summers. In Los Angeles, AYP volunteers are are working on an eight-week summer camp run by Girls, Inc., a nonprofit organization that supports, mentors and guides girls in an affirming, pro-girl environment. Partners and staff will have the opportunity to share their skills by facilitating our Access Your Potential curriculum as part of the camp’s focus on financial literacy, STEM and technology. In New York, they are setting up custom events with DREAM, a nonprofit that provides inner-city youth with opportunities to play, learn and grow using the power of teams. Students spend the mornings learning in a classroom, and afternoons are spent on the softball/baseball field, learning about teamwork and leadership. In Hartford, they brought in two local middle school robotics teams to the office to work with our PwCers to assemble small robots, gaining pieces of the robots by answering a series of math and critical thinking questions. When the robots were completed, the students took them back to their schools to share the robotics experience with other students in their schools. These are just a few examples of what’s going on around the country. Visit Impact Space to find an opportunity near you.

The move to Aura Online will provide many benefits, including a new team dashboard, integration with other Assurance tools, and the elimination of replication functionality that will cease to be supported by the vendor in 2020 and which has presented challenges and pain points. It’s one more step forward on our Your Tomorrow journey to digitally enable our practice and enhance your experience as practitioners. The next major release of Aura is expected in spring 2019, at which time all Aura functionality will be available in Aura Online. Local Aura replicas and the Navigator are planned to be sunset no later than spring 2020. What can you expect in the transition? Here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions. Why is Aura moving to an online platform? The vendor for replication services will cease support in mid 2020 which is in keeping with the industry shift to web-based solutions, in other words change is not optional. In a similar vein, all existing custom PwC Assurance tools, and those currently in development, are only available in an online platform. This on-line architecture also enables more rapid tool enhancements including continued investment in integrating with our other Assurance applications to drive greater efficiencies. What is the user experience expected to be in Aura Online? Are enhancements planned before the full transition? The core functionality of Aura Online will work very similarly to the existing local version of Aura, and all functionality will be available in Aura Online by spring 2019. In addition, a number of new enhancements are planned, including updates to the user interface, further performance improvements, and new features such as an integrated sampling app to help make sample selection easier. I have limited or no connectivity at the client site and/or travel frequently. How will my team use Aura Online? Good connectivity, specifically access to high-speed internet, is critical for having the best possible experience using Aura Online. Therefore, the Aura Implementation and US IT teams are working to identify and assist teams that have historically had limited network connectivity at client sites to prepare them for the move to online. This effort will continue this fall and through spring/summer 2019. If you know your team has or will have limited connectivity at a client site (or a situation where the client does not provide any network access) and your team has not yet heard from the US implementation team, please fill out this form and an implementation resource will reach out to you. Engaging with clients to implement remediation is often necessary, so getting started early is desirable. I travel frequently. Will I be able to work offline? Aura Offline will provide some offline capabilities, allowing you to check out (download) a number of EGAs and Document Library items for editing and review while disconnected from the PwC network. You will be able to use Aura Offline for example when traveling or commuting when getting connected is not possible or is subpar, or in situations where you have limited connectivity at the client site. However, we expect you will work online most of the time, and only work in Aura Offline for short periods when connectivity is not available. What can I be doing now to plan for this move? Review the full FAQs document for detailed information about the transition. Familiarise yourself with Aura Online and Aura Mobile with this video. Begin discussing these changes with your teams to raise awareness and identify concerns. Identify members of your team who are already using or can begin using Aura Online to complete their audits in order to gather feedback on the overall experience, as well as opportunities for improvement or best practices you’d like to share (click here to provide any feedback). Stay tuned for more to come in the spring of 2019.

Do you understand the Pricing Structures and Pricing Enablers that can further differentiate PwC in the market? And do you know how to bring our Smart Pricing strategy to life for your teams? We’ve made tremendous progress towards our Your Tomorrow - Project 5 Million goals, and it’s all thanks to your dedication to transforming how we deliver work, support our people and articulate our value in the market.

To assist teams on the journey, we’re laser-focused on providing the support and resources needed to successfully execute the strategy. To assist teams on the journey, we’re laser-focused on providing the support and resources needed to successfully execute the strategy. In this regard, we’ve expanded Smart Pricing xLoS to enable greater One Firm collaboration, released a One Firm Smart Pricing Tool to simplify the end-to-end pricing process, and launched the Smart Pricing Tax microsite for all managers and above. Our dedicated Tax section of the microsite features valuable resources for taking the next step on our Smart Pricing journey -- no matter where you stand right now. This site is also available as an app in PwC’s App Store. What you’ll find In addition to a wealth of One Firm Smart Pricing content, managers and above can access a variety of Tax-specific resources, customized to our business and the solutions we deliver, including the following: - Pricing with Purpose and FeeTV: Say goodbye to the email newsletters from last year.

How to use the Smart Pricing microsite (hint: remember to Pause, Reflect and Plan)… Our P5M and Smart Pricing strategies are deeply intertwined. As you consider how to digitize your engagement to drive greater value for your clients, we ask that you pause, reflect and thoughtfully plan your pricing approach. When we take the time to identify and communicate the value we deliver to our clients (i.e., co-develop an investment thesis), we can more effectively price in the context of the outcomes we deliver -- rather than rates and hours. In doing so, we will sustain the investments we’re making in our innovation and our people, differentiate PwC in the market, and deliver a deeper Client Experience.

As a firm that is purpose-led and values-driven, we do not tolerate inappropriate conduct at PwC. We already have strong policies and provide training to maintain a respectful workplace at PwC -- and we are committed to doing even more. We’re providing additional training for everyone and at all levels. We just rolled out training specifically for all partners in the US and Mexico. We just released training for supervisory staff in the US (available now on your My Compliance Dashboard). Seniors, managers, senior managers, directors and MDs must complete this training by Thursday, Sept. 6. US Partners will also take this training. For staff in the US below senior associate, information on training will follow this summer. We’re hosting conversations about respect in the workplace in our offices. This is a continuation of our open conversations on difficult issues. In February, the Washington, DC, office hosted our first event, and more than 100 people were part of a candid discussion about appropriate behavior in the workplace. In March, the Houston and Dallas offices, as well as our firmwide Forensics practice, engaged more than 600 partners and staff in three separate conversations. Based on the engagement and positive feedback, we’ll be hosting additional discussions in offices across the firm over the next year. We will keep you apprised of these sessions in PwC Inside and through your local market leaders. We’re unveiling “Candid Conversations: Respect in the Workplace” podcasts. Listen in while Jennifer Allyn, our Diversity Strategy Leader, interviews Denis Clarke, our Ethics &amp; Business Conduct Leader, about the #metoo movement and answers some questions we all have about how we handle these issues at PwC. Team, these trainings and brave conversations will help all of us recognize those moments when we need to take action and live our values. It comes down to each of us treating others with respect -- and each one of us understanding that if we see a situation that isn’t right, we speak up.

The new policy provides a consistent and streamlined approach to assigning inventory observations and scheduling PIOs for your engagements -- a more evenly spread out process.

Didn’t get a chance to tune in live? Read up on the moments you missed here, and watch the replay (access instructions below)! Our Your Tomorrow strategy continues to gain momentum. Our strategy hasn’t changed -- we continue to focus on driving our Citizen-led and Business-led Your Tomorrow strategy, and we’re seeing the impact grow every day both inside and outside our firm. While more than 20,000 of us have already completed our four Digital Quests, our goal is to increase that to all 50,000 of us by June 30. And, it’s not too late to be part of Learn2earn! Complete the four Digital Quests and earn 150 Digital Lab points by TODAY, April 30, for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition. Digital Lab is saving us thousands of hours on our client engagements and internal projects. Partner Michelle Wilkes and panelists Jordan Jobs, Eileen O’Neill and Guy Delvecchio shared the tools that have made an impact on the work they do each day, aligned with the “Find. Build. Share.” aspects of Digital Lab. From creating an Alteryx workflow that wowed Jordan’s client, Verizon, to Eileen’s story around building and sharing the Hoteling Reservation Automation and the WIP Review Visualization to the cultural change that Guy helped drive at the HR SSC, our colleagues are seizing the opportunity to apply what they’ve learned and reimagine the possible for our clients and colleagues.

We were also joined during the broadcast by CODE-E the robot, who makes technology fun to students in diverse and underserved communities. It’s all part of Responsible Business Leadership and how we bring our Purpose to life. Meditating is not only good for us, but good for our firm. Chief Clients Officer Amity Millhiser joined us live from San Francisco with Calm founder and co-CEO Alex Tew. During their conversation, Alex shared tips on how to meditate successfully and even guided the firm through a two-minute meditation live on air! For additional help and resources on meditation and mindfulness, be sure to download the Calm app for free from PwC’s App store. Meditation is aligned with the mental and spiritual dimensions of our Be well, work well strategy, and is just one way we can fuel our energy and help regain focus both professionally and personally Gympass and Ginger are here to help boost our physical, mental and emotional health. Amity also announced two exciting new benefits -- Gympass, which is coming this summer, aligns with our physical dimension of Be well, work well. Gympass will provide access to thousands of gyms, facilities and activities, all for one discounted membership fee. And, as a bonus you’ll earn Well-Being Rewards points while using Gympass!

Enroll in PwC’s specialization in Coursera: Data Analysis and Presentation Skills: The PwC Approach. The five courses in this specialization include roughly 10 to 15 hours of online learning content taught by PwC professionals. The courses comprise videos, reading and quizzes -- and they’re free for partners and staff. No prior knowledge of data and analytics is required. Upon completion, you’ll know how to use data and analytics to solve important problems and present data to others in engaging ways. You can complete each course at your own pace, taking just one -- or all -- of the five courses in the specialization. Present complex data with ease Prior to becoming a Digital Accelerator, Sylvia Binkley enrolled in the specialization to build her data analytics and presentation skills. “By setting aside time each workday, I was able to complete the specialization in less than six weeks,” Sylvia said. “The course was beneficial because I learned how to present complex data, which is something I wasn’t previously comfortable with.” As a Digital Accelerator, Sylvia has had to put her presentation skills to the test. “I was asked to meet with our local Market Council and explain the work Digital Accelerators have been doing,” she said. “My presentation provided a clear overview to the council and included our ask of them.” Everyone at the firm, regardless of their role, can benefit and discover tremendous value in completing the Coursera specialization. Reach your potential and position yourself to be relevant in a rapidly changing world, by enrolling in Coursera today! For more details, check out the Coursera Q&amp;A page.

PwC's CODE-E debuts in NYC Celebrity sighting! PwC's CODE-E debuts in NYC Responsible Business Leadership Dec. 10, 2018 Last week, our human-sized robot and the newest member of PwC’s Access Your Potential® (AYP) team showcased its talents with students in New York. CODE-E warmed up by hosting middle school students from New Alternatives for Children, one of New York Metro’s long-standing nonprofit collaborators (learn more here), at our 300 Madison office. The bot then inspired elementary and high school students across the city to innovate solutions to problems at their schools. With Access Your Potential, we’re helping bridge the gap between the digital skills that employers need and the shortage of qualified candidates by addressing the underlying causes — such as limited access to technology education, especially in underserved communities. CODE-E brings robots out of the realm of toys and sci-fi movies and into classrooms to show students robotics technology so they can see it, interact with it and ask questions about how it works in real life. To make sure kids’ interactions with CODE-E are meaningful, we’ve worked with educators to develop a special curriculum that prompts student discussions around emerging technology and personal innovation. So far, it’s a hit. Some students are even ready to take CODE-E home: “If I had CODE-E in my house, it would help me with my homework.” Interested in bringing CODE-E to your market to engage with students and clients? Request an appearance here. Find the latest Access Your Potential volunteer opportunities on Impact Space, including events that showcase CODE-E in your local market.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Derek Kaivani, a senior manager on the Client Experience team, based out of Atlanta. I've been with the firm for 20 years. After spending most of my career in client service, I made the switch to IFS last year. What's a typical day for you? I help spread the word about the client experience strategy, what it means and how it relates to all of us in our day-to-day lives -- no matter the LoS, or whether our clients are internal or external. I get to travel the globe to share this vision and help inspire engagement teams to "live" the client experience strategy -- not just talk the talk, but walk the walk. How did your journey lead you to this role? I joined the firm as a strategy consultant in Advisory, and later moved to internal audit where I helped rebuild and expand Advisory's operational services capabilities, including the internal audit framework. What followed was Project Edison, a firm initiative focused on delivering a more distinctive experience to our Assurance clients. I was able to see firsthand a significant shift in the firm's client experience strategy. A natural next step led to joining the PwC Experience team, which later became the Client Experience team, where I've been ever since. How does your team bring value to PwC? We want everyone to be as excited as we are about recognizing and achieving successful client experiences! We provide actionable ways to exceed client expectations, not only through the value of what we do, but in how we do it. We help our people strive to be more client-centric across the board. And by generating insights from customer analytics, we can also help our leaders drive loyalty and make customer-driven decisions. What might we be surprised to learn about you? As a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, I’m a four-time Pan-American champion and a Brazilian Nationals champion. My passion for helping others goes hand-in-hand with my love for this sport. I enjoy working with athletes of every level. There’s a lot of joy in teaching -- especially when I work with children and witness the power the sport has to transform their lives. I'm in awe of how it can improve not only their fitness level, but their overall self-confidence as well. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way?

As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors and IFS directors with five or more years of service are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to unwind, recharge and truly focus on their well-being through Be well, work well -- a key component of Your Tomorrow. San Diego-based Director Scott Dudzik always imagined his career milestone sabbatical would be spent playing golf or vacationing around the world with his wife. All that changed, though, when she announced they were pregnant with their first child. “Fatherhood changed my perspective on life,” Scott admits. “Finding a healthy balance between work and family became a priority. In the past, I took things like our firm’s flexibility for granted. Now I recognize the priceless value of working at a firm that supports its people in finding that balance.” Scott knew he would be able to take advantage of our eight weeks of parental leave. But to maximize his time with his family, Scott considered combining the leave with his sabbatical. “My client schedule doesn’t have a quiet period, given multiple off year-end audits,” Scott says. “So I wasn’t sure how my leadership teams would view my proposal for an extended leave, or if they would support it. Nonetheless, I thought it was worth having the conversation and am glad I did.” Scott’s partners and colleagues supported his request. Based on schedules, they decided it would be best to take the 13-week leave beginning in October, after his client filed at their year-end. The timing worked out beautifully for Scott’s family. “Baby Connor arrived on July 22,” Scott says. “My wife was able to spend her maternity leave with him and when it was time for her to go back to work, I stepped in.” Scott was able to build a special bond with his son and watch him develop. Scott cherishes the memory of his uninterrupted leave and is grateful for his team’s support. “Everyone was very respectful of my time away from work. I encourage others to communicate their needs or requests (such as asking for flexibility or protected time) with their teams. Don’t be afraid to ask. You’ll find people are understanding of what’s important to you and willing to support you.” Visit our Rewards Strategy site to learn more about sabbaticals and PwC's Career Milestone program.

They wanted to empower customer advocates with critical member information such as care gaps and medical history, that would ultimately allow HCSC to not just compete in, but lead the new market of advocacy-driven solutions. We put the customer at the center of everything—and that’s how we stood out. We created a Magic Moment... Improving the lives of real people is core to what HCSC values, and that’s what inspired our change efforts. We put the customer center-stage and spotlighted every touchpoint area around them. Where were the critical care moments? How could we support those moments in the most standout of ways while meeting business needs and tying in the underlying technology seamlessly? We worked side by side with HCSC leaders at our Experience Center to re-imagine the care journey itself. We showed the client how they could save $600 million through our approach. The solution and value we brought Through BXT, we deployed our Strategy/Enterprise Resilience Integrated Solution, leading to an evolved operating model that upskilled and organized agents. Rather than simply replacing a desktop application, the new approach merges fragmented products and experiences across the enterprise. Customers will have greater access to self-service digital tools and high quality care, supported by increasingly personalized information. The new strategy will improve the health care experience for ~1.5M people in 2019 and 14M+ people by 2021, with over $600M projected total cost savings of the program. "The new engagement strategy PwC helped us develop will deliver a truly differentiated service model, allowing us to outperform our competitors and build meaningful experiences for our customers."

This was originally scheduled to occur on May 25, but a few additional teams surfaced their need to be put on the exception list to ensure their compliance with client engagements outside of the US. For most partners and staff, you’ll be able to work entirely in Google. However, some types of emails may still be delivered to your Notes inbox. If this happens, you’ll receive a notification in your Google mailbox to alert you to any messages that are not forwarded. This may include: Mail from some exception clients and PwC China/Hong Kong PwC systems that rely on Notes applications Notes email messages that are over 25MB or encrypted. Answers to your burning questions ... I’ve been using Notes for years. What resources are available to learn about working in Google? A wealth of resources is available. Here are a few of our top recommendations to learn more: Ask Google. Just click on theicon in Google Mail to search for answers. (Hint: Search for “Gmail Essential Overview” for a great introduction.) Check out the Google@PwC Spark site. It’s filled with tips and tricks for using Google. There’s also a network of users to ask questions and share ideas with. View Connect ’n’ Learn training videos and materials to learn more. Will my Google mail now be filled with more spam? Any mail that you get in your Notes inbox today will be forwarded to Google including your End User Digest from PwCSpamCentre. You can block additional senders by visiting the PwCSpamCentre website (log in with your GUID and GUID Password). Additionally, you can mark an individual email in Google as spam by clicking on the “Report spam” icon in Google Mail. I work with a client on the Global Google Exception Client Registry. What do I need to do? PwC staff working with any client on the Global Google Exception Client Registry will need to continue to use Notes to avoid having information that is required to remain in Notes from being forwarded to Google. Any emails sent to your Notes account from Microsoft and Goldman Sachs will not be forwarded. For users that still have a Notes Calendar, we will not enable mail forwarding for you. I work with client(s) on the exception registry. Should I turn off the Notes Forwarding? Yes. If you work with any clients on the exception registry, you should turn off Notes Forwarding on June 11. I work with PwC China/Hong Kong. What will happen? Any emails from PwC colleagues in China/Hong Kong will be delivered to your Notes inbox. I need to route a specific email via Notes. Is that still possible? Yes. If you need to keep an email in Notes, you may still select "Route via Notes" in the email options. However, that option will need to be selected for every email you want to route via Notes; there is not an option to enable that setting for all Notes email. You should select the “Route via Notes” option when sending email that contains information about a client on the Exception Registry. I use a lot of Mail Rules in Notes, will those still work? Mail Rules in Notes will not transfer to Google; you will need to create mail filters in Google. Information about creating Google email filters is available here. If I send email from my mobile device, what will happen? Update your mobile device mail app settings: go to Settings, then Mail; change your Default Account to PwC Cloud. Google is now your default. You can still select Notes when sending an individual email via mobile, but it will be forced to stay in Notes: when composing an email, tap the From line twice and it will let you select you @us.pwc.com address instead of your @pwc.com address.

Although some apps are convenient to install or are familiar from your personal use, they may not provide the level of security needed to protect firm and client information. WhatsApp, WeChat, personal email and SMS text messaging are not permitted for business use. It is prohibited to conduct business or send communications containing confidential business information through personal emails, SMS text messages or other unauthorized applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram and others that come preinstalled on your device. This includes communications with partners, staff, clients or any other third parties. Additionally, the terms of use for some of these apps conflict with how PwC conducts business. For example, they do not guarantee that conversations or files exchanged are confidential. In addition, chats in these applications may not get erased -- often they are simply hidden and archived in the database of the app. These pose unacceptable information protection risks and are why such apps are not permitted for any business-related purposes. What messaging apps can I use for business? You may use the following secure messaging apps: Google Chat (get the hang of Google Chat) Google Hangouts Notes Sametime (for communicating with non-Google territories) Need help? Check the Mobile Device Standard, Appendix 2 for updates to the approved mobile technology list and review this list of firm-approved collaboration tools. You can also visit the PwC App Store for more apps and guidance.

In situations where our clients ask us to perform additional Tax services or our services begin to expand (i.e., beyond those we were originally engaged to provide), judgment is required to evaluate whether the additional services represent a substantive change in the nature or scope of services (i.e., “scope creep”) warranting additional approvals. Tax engagement teams should monitor the nature or scope of services provided as their engagements progress, to ensure that the scope does not exceed what was pre-approved by the audit committee (if applicable) and approved by the Responsible Partner listed in Central Entity Service ("CES") through the Authorisation For Services ("AFS") process. Engagement teams should be proactive and discuss additional scope requests with the client and the CES Responsible Partner before performing any additional work. If the nature or scope of services changes or exceeds what has been approved in the original AFS, an additional AFS approval must be obtained from the CES Responsible Partner prior to being engaged to provide or performing the additional services. (Note, when providing certain Tax services, you may also need to obtain AFS approval from a Secondary Independence Reviewer by adding the “US AFSReview” as an Approver on the AFS – see link for more information.) Additionally, you should ensure that the CES Responsible Partner considers whether additional pre-approval by the audit committee is required. Examples of changes in the nature or scope of services requiring an additional AFS (and potentially additional audit committee pre-approval) may include: A change in the nature of the work requested - for example, changing a compliance engagement to include consulting services Changes in the facts and circumstances that may impact the evaluation of threats to independence (including those that impact materiality considerations) Changes in client management that impacts its ability to perform its proper management responsibilities A change such that the service is now being provided to a different affiliate(s) Complying with our independence requirements, including identifying and obtaining the appropriate approvals for “scope creep”, requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. For additional information regarding “scope creep”, see the Independence Policy, Section 4060.12 Scope "Creep". Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

But did you know that lifelong friendships can be formed at Discover? We recently sat down with a group of 2015 alum who developed long-lasting friendships with colleagues they met at Discover. Here’s what some of them had to say. Christopher Houseman Just before my trip to Discover, life was chaotic. Professionally, I was adjusting to a new job title and role at the firm. Personally, I became a father and the primary caretaker of my household. On top of that, I was studying for the CPA exam. While Discover didn’t make these stresses and responsibilities magically disappear, it did allow me to take a step back, reflect and learn sustainable habits to achieve long-lasting success. More so, it was an opportunity for nine uniquely different people to forge a friendship that continues to grow today. Rebecca Evans Discover couldn’t have happened at a better time in my life. I remember heading there filled with angst and heartache. As a French native, the 2015 Paris attacks had me concerned for my family and friends back home. Upon arrival, I was randomly placed on a team with eight other senior associates from different lines of service and parts of the country. Never did I think it was the beginning of a longtime friendship. Despite having very different career paths at PwC, we immediately clicked. The team had so much in common. We all expressed interest in traveling and living a Be well, work well lifestyle. More importantly, I realized everyone faces challenges. They may not be the same as mine, but we’re all in it together. Anna Khoma Our team coach Kym Ward Gaffney created an atmosphere where the nine of us felt comfortable to truly open up and talk about things we otherwise would rarely discuss with colleagues and strangers. Bonds quickly formed and we were inseparable that week, even during times we weren’t required to be together. We started a group text thread so that we could stay in contact while at Discover. To my pleasant surprise, the thread continues today. We regularly check in on each other. Sometimes to share exciting news like having a baby, getting promoted, getting married. Other times it’s to ask for career advice or assistance in navigating the firm. I recommend every team at Discover finds a way to keep the conversation going. Paul Dwaileebe I enjoy staying in touch with my Discover friends and helping them progress in their careers here. I recently shared that I was selected to be a Digital Accelerator, and a couple of them have reached out for advice on increasing their Digital IQ. Thanks to Discover, I was able to reflect on important matters in my life. It also humanized the people I work with. We all have similar goals and challenges. It’s through these similarities we came together and it’s through the differences that we continue learn from one another and grow. Reunion time! The group has not been together in person since Discover -- but they’re currently planning a reunion. And until then, they remain one text away. Note: Everyone at the firm, regardless of role, can experience Discover. Check out the Discover Toolkit for videos, a conversation guide, and best practices for supporting Discover in your market.

People Team April 26, 2019 Appreciating and acknowledging the impact and contributions of our people not only reaffirms our values and strengthens our relationships, it also encourages others to continue delivering their best work. To fuel your team’s motivation and emotional well-being, check out these three tech-enabled tools and training resources to help you express appreciation in meaningful ways. Real-time recognition: Provide immediate appreciation for noteworthy individual or team performance and shape our recognition culture by making in-the-moment gratitude part of your every day. Through Real-time recognition, monetary and non-monetary awards celebrate those who demonstrate the firm’s values and behaviors. Check out these effective recognition tips and recognize a deserving colleague today, especially before the performance year ends on April 30! Note for budget holders: The second spend period will close on June 27 at 5 p.m. ET — if you don’t use your spending balance by then, you’ll lose it. Appreciation Bank: We often know it’s important to thank someone, yet we struggle with how to meaningfully communicate our gratitude. Learn how to express the “five languages of appreciation” — words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, quality time and spontaneous celebration — to help build deeper relationships with colleagues and clients. You can view acts of gratitude from each of the five languages and filter them by audience (individual, team and client) and method (in-person and virtual). Motivating By Appreciation Inventory: Learning in a Box: This training and its corresponding activities help create an appreciative workplace culture, broaden perspectives and teach participants how to choose the most meaningful ways to express authentic gratitude. Learning in a Box provides step-by-step instructions to easily facilitate a 60-minute in-person or virtual training session. In fact, more than 95 sessions have already been facilitated for 1,455 partners and staff. Note: If you have questions or feedback about the Motivating By Appreciation Inventory: Learning in a Box, reach out to Nicole Wong. "This learning solution resonated with every person on my team and can do the same for any group of people. Everyone wants to be appreciated — and it can be a difficult thing to ask for, so I am happy that PwC is creating the space for our teams to discuss in a candid, but organized way.” — Stephanie Nowlen, Associate If you’re interested in gaining additional insights on how, when and why to express meaningful appreciation at work, check out these curated assets in Vantage.

If you took care of those things, you took an important step in making your switch to the new system go smoothly. iPad winners will be alerted via email by July 27. Missed out on completing your pre-go-live tasks? New AmEx charges shifted to the new system on July 9. Any expenses that were not cleared from your legacy Mobile Expense system by July 16 have been marked as personal and must be paid by you directly to AmEx. If a valid firm expense was marked personal, please pay AmEx directly and submit the expense as out of pocket in the new system. If you need help with an AmEx reconciliation for charges incurred prior to July 9, submit this form for support. Please note: AmEx reconciliations will not be provided for SAP Concur data.

This small Swiss village was transformed for the week as companies, countries and groups converted shops and storefronts into their home base. The WEF and participants support international collaboration as a way of solving critical global challenges. At any given time, countless sessions were being held and leaders were engaging around topics ranging from digitization to globalization, and inclusion to economics. This week Tim Ryan was on the ground, along with members of the Network Leadership Team, to represent PwC US as our 22nd annual Global CEO Survey was released. As the week wrapped up, Tim recorded a video message with his three biggest observations. Watch his video and read on below for a peek at his calendar from a busy week. On Monday, PwC launched our 22nd annual Global CEO Survey. PwC Global Chairman Bob Moritz presented the results to World Economic Forum attendees in Davos. Among the findings this year: CEOs are tempering their expectations and are more cautious, if not pessimistic, about global growth. To learn more and share with your clients, access survey findings at www.pwc.com/us/ceosurvey (or download the PDF). Throughout the week, Tim met with members of the media, including a discussion of 21st century leadership with Eric Gertler, Chairman of US News and World report. Our internal CEO Survey - Global site is the place to find client-ready decks (exec summary or full version). More resources will be added throughout spring 2019, including sector reports (see the release schedule). On Thursday, Tim and PwC Workforce of the Future leader Carrie Duarte joined a panel discussing why caring, purpose and equality at work matter in the digital age. The panel was hosted by the Female Quotient, an organization committed to advancing diversity in the workplace. We know from our own recently released report on purpose in the workplace, "Making work more meaningful," that employees want — and expect — to be fulfilled at work. Tim shared his thoughts on Twitter (@Timothy_F_Ryan) and reacted to the CEO Survey findings with a LinkedIn blog on how business can grow even as CEOs become more cautious. You can be part of the conversation on social, too.

CarVal Investors had three goals: Free employees from manually intensive, repetitive processes Enable employees to focus on more important work Drive productivity We brought together a mix of One Firm thought leaders and industry experts to create a distinctive proposal. Our focus: integrating robotic process automation (RPA). Targeting three processes with RPA, we saved the client a total of 110 minutes. That's a 77% savings, using only 2% of the bot's daily capacity -- all while reducing errors and freeing up capacity at high-value times. With the appropriate mix of One Firm thought leaders and industry experts, we created a distinctive proposal for the client. Joe Wiggins, Assurance partner, received the initial call from the CFO, and brought in Danielle Valkner, Advisory partner focused on Asset Management, and Kevin Kroen, Financial Services Intelligent Automation leader, to drive the pursuit and oversee the work. The work was led by Michael Berland and Basil Carr, and the team included Siva Pinisetty and Ryan Nealon from Financial Services Advisory. The client had heard of RPA -- software easily programmed to carry out basic rules-based, repetitive tasks -- but wasn’t sure how it could benefit them. At the same time, we worked with stakeholders across their firm to find processes ripe for automation By aligning the robotics program to CarVal’s three strategic objectives of growing the business, increasing productivity and improving employee engagement, we demonstrated the value of integrating RPA across their operations. We also provided them with a business case and demos so they can work with leadership to socialize RPA and demonstrate a broader case for change. Interested in learning more about RPA?

Our "Upskilling in Action" series celebrates the successes of some of your colleagues who are accelerating their digital skills and applying them on projects and with clients. As an Industry Tax Practice (ITP) Tax manager and Digital Accelerator based in Virginia, Megan Miller is no stranger to having technology at the forefront of her client work. In fact, many of her Tax clients themselves sit within the tech sector. Megan is currently working on a large team that is helping digitize their client’s compliance processes. During a recent brainstorming session, the team began to mull over areas for improvement. As is the case across so many compliance engagements, the team had been spending a significant amount of time performing manual Excel manipulations. As the team brainstormed ways to eliminate this manual work, Megan identified an opportunity to create a batch macro. Megan built a trial balance workflow to streamline the process of mapping multiple individual entity trial balances year over year. The key difference between this workflow and the other trial balance mapping workflows available is that this new workflow is a batch macro that can map the trial balances of multiples entities all at once. Work like this can sometimes be tedious, which is why these are exactly the kinds of repeatable processes that are exciting for PwCers to find ways to automate. “This workflow is great for clients who require customized accounts,” Megan said. “Using it will save our people and their clients a significant amount of time, especially clients that have many entities or large client footprints.” “When it comes to Digital Upskilling,” Megan continued, “we need to push ourselves to keep evolving just like the firm.” Her advice for others? “Don’t assume that it is someone else's responsibility to know technology and that you can simply continue on with your normal day-to-day role. Take an active interest in your career and get onboard!” Want to build your own digital skills? A great place to start is the Digital Hub, the home to all things Digital Upskilling — available on PC and mobile via the Digital Hub app in PwC’s App Store. You’ll find pre-reads to get ready for PowerUp! games, Learning Bursts, Tech While You Trek podcasts, Digital Quests and more, including excellent third party resources too. As you complete automations, visualizations and workflows, be sure to submit them to Digital Lab — if they're accepted, you'll be sharing your expertise with your colleagues and will be rewarded. And don’t forget our FY19 Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal for everyone at PwC — join the thousands of PwCers who have already earned the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests on or before June 30, 2019. As an added incentive, get an early start through Learn2earn by completing all four Digital Quests and earning a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points before April 30 and you’ll be entered for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — one in seven will win!

Over the past year we’ve rolled out a number of key “renovations”, or enhancements, to FlexForecast, our budgeting, pricing and estimate to complete (ETC) tool: We’ve integrated with TalentLink - a significant advancement in operational efficiencies - creating an automated connection between demand and supply and allowing insight into our staffing needs like never before. We’ve upgraded functionality for the budgeting and ETC screens for an enhanced user experience. We’ve implemented the ability to enter ETC hours and rates by person, allowing us a greater level of accuracy in our ability to forecast and manage the business. And we’ve been continuously designing new enhancements, as well as integrations with other firm systems to create an operationally efficient experience for you, our engagement teams - all while working to onboard the Assurance LoS to make Flex a truly xLoS tool. The speed at which we’ve made these enhancements has also presented some challenges. As more and more gets built into the tool, its performance has taken a hit and is not currently operating at the level that we expect of a tool that is so critical to the management of our business. We understand the frustration from a user experience, particularly for those of you trying to budget or manage larger, more complex projects, and are working diligently to identify the issues and resolve as quickly as possible. Multiple fixes have been released over the past few weeks, so you should already see some improvement, but we will continue to do more. So we ask for your patience while using Flex as we get it operating again like the exceptional tool that it is. Please reach out to your Vertical Finance Teams with any questions or concerns in the meantime.

For Chloe Timothy, the opportunity to increase focus on well-being helped her rediscover a passion for composing music. The result: her debut album of original compositions on piano, “Meditation Elasticity.” It’s no surprise that Chloe turned to music. An accomplished pianist who’s currently working on a memoir, Chloe was the first woman in her home country of South Africa to earn a degree in jazz performance. Today, in her role as an executive coach, Chloe shares the importance of well-being with her internal clients every day. But she realized she was ignoring her own advice. Embracing Be well, work well “It all began when I decided to embrace Be well, work well by taking a five-minute energy break and sat in front of my piano,” Chloe reflected. “These breaks became a daily habit. I’d play on the piano and allow my emotions to take over the moment.” These informal sessions soon turned into an entire meditation album that artistically taps into the four dimensions of energy. “I was so inspired that I composed an entire album of songs,” Chloe said. “I decided to record the music on my phone and share it with a handful of friends. The feedback was overwhelming. Many of them began using my music during their daily meditation. This inspired me to professionally record the album and make it publicly available.” ‘Meditation Elasticity’ The critically acclaimed “Meditation Elasticity” was released worldwide in April. Every song ties to a dimension of energy. For example, “Rem Dreaming” (physical), “Focal Projection” (mental), “Emotional Untangling” (emotional), and “Rewire for Purpose” (spiritual). “We get so caught up in work that we forget we have tools inside ourselves that help us overcome challenges,” Chloe said. “You have the answers within. So take a step back, pause and reflect to find them.” Next for Chloe is publishing her first memoir. We wish her continued success! #PwCProud Do you have a Be well, work well story to share?

With HP facing increasing commoditization in its core personal computing and print businesses, the client engaged PwC to identify opportunities for big data and analytics to support their transformation from a product-focused transactional company to a customer-focused services company. What was our solution for HP? We wowed HP stakeholders with the “art of the possible” by illustrating how HP can drive competitive advantage using the insights generated through analytics use cases. As a part of the proposal process, we applied BxT principles to develop user stories that got the client excited about working with us and our vision for the future. We identified over 80 use cases and 20 user stories that brought analytics to life for the client and applied our analytics transformation framework across a holistic operating model to address more than just the typical technology issues. Leveraging the Analytics &amp; AI Transformation (AAIT) Integrated Solution and the Fit for Growth platform, we led our strategy with business aligned analytics which helped the client bridge the gap across business and IT stakeholders.

And because of this, some of us have more airline miles accumulated than we know what to do with! PwC collects frequent flier miles to help Make-A-Wish get wish kids to their dream destination - whether it be Cinderella’s Castle at Disney World or a winter wonderland to see snow for the first time. Across the U.S., the Make-A-Wish® Foundation grants wishes to children between the ages of 2 ½ and 18 with critical illnesses. This year, over 75% of wish kids will travel for their once-in-a-lifetime experience. As a result, Make-A-Wish needs 2.9 billion airline miles to fly wish kids and their families to their destination of choice. Many major airlines, including Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue, enable frequent flier members to donate to Make-A-Wish. It’s a simple but meaningful way you can help grant the wishes of children with critical illnesses. Please visit our PwC wish page to make a miles donation and Impact Space to make a monetary donation.

An update to our Career Milestone Sabbatical Program Good news! An update to our Career Milestone Sabbatical Program People Team June 4, 2019 We’ve got good news! On July 1, we’ll transition to our new, globally aligned staff levels. This includes the introduction of senior manager as a staff level across our lines of service. To support this change, we’re adjusting the eligibility requirements for the milestone sabbatical award for promotions effective July 1, 2019. Previously, we required promotees to have five years of service before they were eligible for a sabbatical. Going forward, client service staff who are promoted to senior manager and have four years of tenure or reach four years of tenure after promotion will be eligible for a sabbatical. IFS staff will be eligible for a sabbatical when they’re promoted to director and have/or reach four years of tenure after promotion. We’ve updated the Manager Milestone FAQs to reflect this change.

Today, we’re pleased to announce that we have integrated FlexForecast with TalentLink and the Deployment process -- making your life easier, and helping engagements to be more profitable. Rapidly evolving market demands mean we need to work differently -- with enhanced One Firm collaboration, efficiency and simplification and increased digitization. Project 5 Million strategy is our response to this, and the integration of FlexForecast with our Deployment process will help drive our strategy by providing enhancements to project management, budgeting and engagement monitoring. These enhancements will help us recognize time savings critical to delivering the Client Experience, digitizing our business and offering our clients more pricing options. How will the integration make your life easier and help us meet our goals? Time savings: Say goodbye to the complex, multi-step process of requesting resources and submitting budgets. Now, FlexForecast will be your single point of entry for budgeting and engagement change requests -- saving time and reducing duplication of efforts. Improved transparency and profitability: With the ability to view, discuss, and update schedules as a team, the integration creates greater visibility into engagement needs and more transparency around schedule expectations. It will also be easier to review key financial metrics and adjust in real time to achieve better margins. Making it possible to recognize capacity: Later this week, your market leader will share new Tax goal-setting placemats for staff, featuring reduced utilization targets. Thanks to the connection we are establishing between FlexForecast and TalentLink, we will have more accurate information about engagement team schedules and capacity -- a crucial step in achieving our Project 5 Million goals and quickly recognizing the value of time gained through digitization. How you can help lead this new way of working Schedule time for development: Meet your non-client chargeable hours targets with the help of increased transparency and team collaboration features. Proactively schedule time for your professional development in TalentLink -- whether this means working through modules in the Digital Fitness app, completing the Tax Foundation Milestones or building the skills necessary to deliver the Client Experience. Maintain personal schedules: A quick glance is all it takes to make sure your personal schedule in FlexForecast and TalentLink is consistent with the work to be done. Raise any concerns within your team, encouraging ongoing team discussions and updates of schedules as needed. Proactively collaborate with your team: Collaborate with your engagement team to make sure schedules are updated in real time and everyone is on the same page. Managers and Directors should regularly update engagement schedules in FlexForecast -- especially in advance of Deployment/Staffing meetings, and at the beginning of the month to be included in the monthly forecast. What’s next? You can look forward to additional enhancements to this integration later in FY19, including leadership reporting and dashboards and the ability to add information about TBD staff. In addition, when the firmwide Contract to Code tracker is launched, the FlexForecast budget will be included as one step of the engagement planning process.

Priority “Priority” is a new section of Google Drive that surfaces files that — just like the name says — are top priorities: files that you and your team use frequently, plus content and tasks that need your attention. Big ups to machine learning! You’re also able to take action (like replying to comments or reviewing recent edits) on suggested documents without even opening the files. Just click “Priority” in Drive’s left navigation menu to view Priority files. The Google Drive mobile app will default to the “Priority” view. Workspaces The Priority section also features Workspaces — easy-to-access and customizable locations to create and organize your files. Any files you have access to (including My Drive and Team Drives) can be collected and sorted however works best for you. And moving files around to suit your fancy won’t change where they are stored in Drive or who has access to them. When files are typically opened together or share common collaborators, Google will suggest creating a new workspace. Simply click “Save as workspace” and then add or remove files as needed. Drive can display up to eight active workspaces at one time, with up to 25 files per workspace. Workspaces are unique to you and cannot be shared. But, they are mobile if you use the Google Drive app (available in PwC’s App Store). To create and manage workspaces on mobile, simply click on the icon with the three dots at the bottom of the app. #PwCUSIT Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40211.html</url><pwc_title>Dr. Who?

Understand the behaviors PwC expects from you by completing your Independence, Ethics and Compliance training by Tuesday, April 23, 11:59 p.m. ET. It’s a Core Compliance Requirement with a firm deadline — there’s no grace period. The training begins with an escape room challenge required for everyone. Once you complete the challenge, you decide how to finish the rest of the mobile-enabled training. There are two versions to choose from: one that’s CPE-eligible, and another containing shorter learning modules that isn’t eligible for CPE. You only need to complete one, so decide which one you’ll take depending on your CPE credit needs. If you’re a manager or above and don’t need CPE credit, you can test your skills and save time -- pass a knowledge assessment in lieu of the course requirements. Please note: Once you've completed, be patient. There might be a delay with completion records synchronizing and moving to the "Completed Tasks" tab on your My Compliance Dashboard.

Over the past two weeks, more than 150 organizations with more than 615,000 people participated in the Day of Understanding. And inside PwC, we held close to 300 sessions to bring our managers, directors and managing directors together to look at diversity and inclusion from a different perspective.They also learned what they can do to make the experience for every person at PwC even better. I’ve heard from many who participated in the sessions inside PwC that this was an eye-opening discussion. It gave them new insights into what an inclusive culture really looks like and a sense of ownership and purpose in how they can make an impact. One person shared that this was, “Probably the most useful, realistic training I've seen in a long time.” And another one of our leaders said: “I want people to know I’m not perfect, but I care.” For those managers and directors who were unable to attend the in-person session, two virtual options will be available on Jan. 8 and 11. Details will be coming via email soon after the holiday break. We’ve started this conversation with our partners and managers, but it doesn’t end there. We will keep this commitment at the forefront of how we move forward as an organization and you will hear about more opportunities to make an impact in the spring and summer. But don’t wait until then to do something important: Take the CEO Action “I Act On” pledge and personally commit to supporting inclusion and driving action at PwC and in your community. This commitment to diversity and inclusion also reached our clients and communities. More than 100 of our colleagues volunteered their time to help our clients and other organizations be part of the Day of Understanding and the response has been inspiring. Partner Shelley Giberson helped to facilitate a 90-minute discussion on unconscious bias with one of our large non-audit clients. “The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The CEO spoke passionately about the importance of D&amp;I and went out of his way to compliment PwC on our leadership. Many approached us at the conclusion of our session to talk about how meaningful it was.” I also heard directly from our clients. The CEO of one of our large manufacturing clients wrote, “We completed a very impactful Day of Understanding on Friday with over 20 discussion groups around the world. I led a group in our world headquarters and we had an incredibly impactful conversation as people ‘shared their story.’ Thanks for your leadership on this important issue. You and your team are catalysts on a transformational opportunity.” Team, I am incredibly proud and I hope this gives you a sense of what we can accomplish when we move together. As one of our colleagues said, we are not a perfect firm -- but we care, we’re working to continue to get better and help others to be better, too. A huge thanks to all who contributed to our efforts inside and outside the firm this week.

Read about the policy update and approva Do you work on C2 Provisions? Read about the policy update and approval requirements for all Tax Accounting Service (TAS) engagements One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 25, 2019 Tax accounting service (“TAS”) engagements present unique and potentially significant risk to the firm, primarily as a result of the engagement’s relationship to our client’s financial statements. Such engagements include the following: Tax provision preparation or review Accounting for uncertain tax positions Tax accounting performance improvement GHRS Pension/OPEB valuation, stock-based compensation accounting or deferred tax related services (ASC 712, 715, 718 and/or 740). Because of the risk profile of such engagements, tax engagement teams should be aware of the risk management protocols to help teams mitigate the risks on these engagements. One such protocol requires that all tax accounting service engagements for non-audit clients be approved by a TAS Market Leader or a GHRS Accounting Services Leader. In addition, tax accounting service engagements that have been designated as high risk require OFRO Tax approval and the approval and active involvement of a Concurring Partner (“CP”) with tax accounting experience. Effective 11/7/2018, all non-restricted (C2) Tax provision review/preparation engagements are required to be restricted in DMS (see the Policy: Confidentiality and DMS access ). All approvals should be obtained during the engagement acceptance process and prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. Engagement teams should select the characteristics that apply to the engagement when completing the A&amp;C engagement acceptance assessment to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained during the Engagement Acceptance process. When providing tax accounting services for non-audit clients, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check restriction in Salesforce first (or Central Entity Service (“CES”)) to determine if client is a non-audit client If a non-audit client, initiate the engagement acceptance assessment in A&amp;C Obtain TAS/GHRS leader approval and, if applicable, OFRO Tax and CP approvals Execute engagement contract Begin work For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that a different approval process applies to engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients.

The client wanted to improve forecasting accuracy so that monthly closes would drive a better-informed, data-driven budgeting and forecasting approach. To test the above hypothesis, the client needed tocompare plan vs. actual financial data on both a retrospective and go-forward basis. The PwC Digital Experience: The client’s plan and actual data were housed in disparate systems, therefore significant data manipulation was required to complete the comparison. A Digital Accelerator leveraged Alteryx’s workflow capabilities to drive efficiencies in data preparation. The team then used Tableau to identify forecasting challenges and analyze the impact of implementing materiality thresholds to various finance-related processes (e.g. Variance Analysis, Topside JEs). The Value Created: For our client, we made monthly analysis a reality by analyzing the impact of monthly closes on the client’s budgeting and forecasting approach. In addition, the client can focus on higher value-add analyses and insight generation by implementing materiality thresholds.

How do you get started with artificial intelligence? Do you have the right AI talent? How will tax reform affect investment in AI development? From the boardroom to the breakroom, AI is becoming part of every business conversation. We know it’s on our clients’ minds — and our new report, “AI Predictions in 2018,” takes a look at the big picture, putting a stake in the ground on the most important AI issues businesses will face in 2018. More than two dozen PwC leaders from across the US and UK firms weighed in on what AI means, and the results are relevant regardless of your line, sector or market. Here’s what those leaders see collectively in the crystal ball — and what businesses need to know in the coming months: AI will impact employers before it impacts employment. AI will hardly ruffle the job market in 2018. But since it demands new structures, enterprises will feel pressure to retool. AI will come down to earth — and get to work. It may not make a good science fiction film, but AI is ready to automate complex processes, identify trends to create business value, and provide forward-looking intelligence. AI will help answer the big question about data. AI isn’t the only answer to the ROI question about data integration and technology initiatives, but it’s an answer that comes with business cases. Functional specialists, not techies, will decide the AI talent race. Computer scientists are important, but domain experts with the skills to work with AI — and AI experts — are crucial for enterprise success. Cyberattacks will be more powerful because of AI — but so will cyberdefense. One job where AI has already shown clear superiority over human beings? Hacking. And now it will be crucial to your cybersecurity strategy. Opening AI’s black box will become a priority. A risk of AI: We won’t understand why it does what it does. The lack of trust will hurt adoption — but solutions are coming. Nations will spar over AI. It’s not a trade war but a research, investment and talent war, and China is moving fast. Pressure for responsible AI won’t just be on tech companies. A global consensus is emerging around principles for responsible AI to safeguard organizations and drive business value.

Is less more in M&amp;A? Platforms July 26, 2018 Overall deals volume in the US may be down, but those that have been announced are bigger and gaining momentum. Megadeals -- transactions of at least $5 billion -- are happening more frequently (doubling from a year ago to an average of two per week) and growing in size (up to $14 billion in the first half of 2018 from $11 billion in the same period last year). PwC’s Q2 2018 Deals Day insights summarize why the demands for growth -- and firms’ willingness to grow at mega-scale -- will keep overall M&amp;A value strong in the months ahead. PwC’s Deals insights are just one way we offer value -- by helping clients make sense of complex issues. Here's what you need to know when discussing the current deals landscape with clients: Value up, volume down: While megadeal volume is up, overall deals volume continues to dip. The second quarter saw the fewest deals since Q4 2015. At the same time, average value per deal has soared, with last quarter delivering twice the value of the same period a year ago. Cross-sector continues: Of more than 5,000 corporate deals, 40% involved a buyer going outside its sector. Tech gets a lot of headlines, as consumer, media and telecom companies have been active acquirers, but that dynamic goes both ways. Jump in IPOs: Values are up in the US IPO markets, as the $16 billion raised last quarter was about one-fourth above Q2 2017. Half of the 66 IPOs occurred in June, the highest monthly total in more than seven years. Cross-border concerns: The geopolitical environment remains turbulent amid tariffs and a greater scrutiny of deals. The value of deals by non-US buyers of US companies is down, and the volume of both inbound and outbound US M&amp;A is down from a year ago.

A joint business relationship (JBR) between PwC and another entity or person may include activities ranging from joint marketing and proposals to joint service offerings and oversight. A JBR can even result just from being a presenter at a conference or other public venue. Alliances and other recurring joint business relationships can present significant market growth opportunities for PwC as they can generate lucrative professional services revenues and provide an effective way to broaden our ability to deliver a wide range of high quality services to our clients. However, alliances and other JBRs can also pose significant risks and potential issues when not engaged or managed appropriately. The Business Relationships: Independence guidance link provides a framework for identifying and evaluating situations that may create a JBR and: describes attributes and other factors that help us determine whether a JBR is direct or indirect, provides examples of direct and indirect JBRs, as well as situations which would not be considered JBRs by applying the framework to different scenarios, and summarizes the process for evaluating, approving and tracking JBRs Identifying activities with another entity or person that could create a JBR (or the appearance of a JBR): The following activities and events could create a JBR which would need to be evaluated under the JBR process. Integrated Activities: Submitting a joint proposal under a prime-subcontractor arrangement. Co-developing or combining products or services with another entity. Generating business for another entity, or sharing revenues, risks, and rewards with another entity. Jointly publishing a book or other publication, or working together on "thought leadership" with another entity. Using products or services purchased from another entity and including them as an integral part of a client deliverable to a third party. Sharing information, expertise, or materials that are not available to others (such as client lists or other confidential business information) with another entity. Events: Conducting training together or providing training on another entity's products or services to a third party. Co-hosting or organizing an event (i.e., creating the agenda, inviting speakers, sending invitations) with another entity. Being the only speaker or being overly prominent at another entity’s event. Participating in an event in which PWC’s speaking role includes a discussion about and/or promotion of another entity’s products or services or the underlying purpose of the event is to promote another entity’s products or services. Marketing: Co-branding activities such as displaying the PwC corporate identity, logo, trademark or trade-name alongside that of just one other entity. Exclusively referring, promoting, or marketing or generating leads for another entity. Marketing another entity's products or services (with or without compensation). Endorsing, supporting, or otherwise making promotional statements about another entity (and vice versa). There is a guide intended to provide a standardized network-wide approach to managing risks associated with a JBR. The Joint Business Relationships Roadmap: A guide to managing risks was prepared by Global R&amp;Q with input from global and various territory business, Alliances &amp; Channels, OGC, Independence and R&amp;Q representatives. It outlines steps that PwC firms should follow to evaluate, put into place and then manage various types of JBRs. It also includes relevant contact information and some collaboration agreement templates. There is also a short "Quick Guide" version of the JBR Roadmap, titled “JBRs – A Roadmap for Partner Sponsors”. Both the JBR Roadmap and the Quick Guide are posted on the Network Alliances &amp; Channels Spark page at this link: https://pwc-spark.com/docs/DOC-307594. For further information and guidance on Joint Business Relationships, there is a JBR Computer Based Training Course included in L&amp;D's Vantage System (search for Joint Business Relationships), or contact Eileen Connolly or Connie Crosley in the Joint Business Relationship Management Group (JBRMG) with questions.

What is very interesting to me is the similarity between the issues our clients are thinking about and the challenges we face at PwC. Our clients are confronting fierce competition, they want to prepare their employees to work in a digital world, and they’re focused on how they execute their strategy (just like us). What I find is that when I share what we’re doing at PwC -- whether that is Your Tomorrow, Be well, work well or Digital Fitness -- they are very interested. My first instinct is always to keep the conversation focused on our clients, so it’s been a learning experience for me. I’m now seeing how sharing the things we’re doing inside PwC can get the conversation rolling and build even more credibility with clients who are solving these same challenges. One last thought … As I meet with our clients, I’m not only listening for opportunities to assist them, I’m also listening to see whether our direction as a firm is the right one. What I continue to see is that aspiring to be a firm that is purpose-led and values-driven, that listens to what our clients tell us, and that is investing and securing the future for all of us is exactly the right destination for our firm.

With Your Tomorrow, we’re digitally enabling our business by investing in our people through digital upskilling and providing them with the tools and technologies that are aligned with market forces -- to deliver higher quality and value, a more digital experience and all at a lower cost. But are employers and employees aligned in thinking that continuous deployment of digital tools at work delivers more productivity, flexibility and innovation from the workforce? In a recent report in PwC’s Consumer Intelligence Series (CIS), we asked more than 12,000 full-time working adults in seven countries about their experiences with technology at work to find out -- and the findings were surprising. Leaders say they’re choosing tech with their people’s needs in mind, but employees don’t agree 90% of C-suite executives agree their company pays attention to people’s needs when introducing new technology. But only about half (53%) of staff say the same. 92% of C-suite execs say they’re satisfied with the technology experience their company provides for making progress on their most important work, only 68% of staff agree. 73% of people surveyed say they know of systems that would help them produce higher-quality work. The CIS survey explores the disconnect between what the C-suite says and their employees experience, breaks down what motivates people to adopt new tech at work, and offers insights to get more buy-in from employees. Read the CIS survey results, and access additional CIS survey resources, including the web page and video, briefing deck, talking points and social messages to share with your clients now. Embracing technology for better outcomes is essential not just for business success, but for training and retaining a motivated workforce. Use the report’s valuable insights as another way to share PwC's Digital Story and to help your clients not just embrace technology, but build a thriving long-term relationship.

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use our technology tools and Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Have you seen a difficult math problem in your client or daily work and didn't know how to begin solving it? Faced with an incredibly complex IRS valuation formula, this team came together to bring value to the client by leveraging technology to solve the problem. Eventually, they’ll help future teams through Digital Lab with your input. When tax planning for a client, Hunter Anderson, a manager in Personal Financial Services, was faced with a complicated charitable contribution. Although his team knew how to do the return, when looking at regulations from the Treasury, they came across a highly complex formula no one on the team had seen before in practice. Thankfully, through One Firm relationships, a solution was found. Hunter had contacts with Victor Lopes, a Digital Accelerator, who was able to make a connection to David Resseguie and Karla Benefiel from the overall Digital Lab team. Together, they rapidly identified a solution using technology. We talked to them to learn more: Hunter: “We were in a high stress situation — no one I knew could help the client. People with the firm for more than two decades had never seen this type of charitable contribution.” David: “We now have access to specialists that we never had before. We are hiring from all different types of backgrounds and building this community. I have a computer science background, and although I didn’t know half of the tax jargon involved in the formula Hunter approached us with, I knew how to interpret the math function and crunch the numbers using a programming language. But, I wanted to show the work in a way that could be checked by the domain experts on the Tax team.” Karla: “Using interactive computing notebooks was a great way to facilitate sharing. It is a common place where all work is able to be shown for reviews and approvals, and you are able to plug in numbers to solve problems in seconds. Plus, even though this formula is rare, if we build up a library of difficult problems like it in notebooks, we can tag them, eventually upload them to Digital Lab, and then if others run into the same problem in the future, we have pre-built solutions they can use. No need to re-invent. We can leverage the firm’s collective intelligence.” Victor: “Even though I wasn’t able to calculate the solution myself, it was easy to review David’s work in the Notebook. Using Excel for this type of problem is very manual; I couldn’t predict how many hours it would take, plus the work would not be visible for others to check, which you need in a complicated scenario like this.” Hunter: “Even though I wasn’t familiar with the notebooks technology, Victor was able to walk me through David’s work. It was signed off, submitted and will result in a multi-million dollar charitable deduction that is great from a tax perspective for our client. I want to express appreciation for this team and the connections made. I knew we had people out there in the firm that would be able to solve the math, but the process was so quick, with the workbook turned around in a day.” David: “Now that we have successfully solved this problem, we want to use it as a stepping stone to create a larger solution for rare, niche formulas and calculations. While uploading just this solution to Digital Lab may not be helpful to the masses, the goal is to grow a collection of calculations that touch all areas of the firm. No need to do the difficult math, you could just enter the values needed and run your calculation. So, you won’t find this niche formula on Digital Lab today, but send us your complex equations and formulas, and we will have a collection of them uploaded soon.” Have a difficult math problem?

It’s Chat -- a powerful instant messaging platform and so much more. The change will roll out across the firm this weekend. By Monday, you’ll be able to: Send screenshots, transfer files and share documents (finally!) Create “Rooms” for up to 8,000 participants (where you can save data and conversation history for six months to track project discussions) Send “Direct messages” (these messages disappear after 24 hours, just like Hangouts) Start a Meet video conference with a simple click (it’s really that easy!) Chat with your PwC colleagues around the globe (Chat has already been rolled out to all other territories currently using Google) Rediscover your old GIFs and emojis from the days of Notes Sametime (you can share those, too!) What happens to Hangouts? Don’t worry, Google is not retiring “classic” Hangouts -- yet. While the rollout of Chat completes Google’s separation of “classic” Hangouts into two distinct apps (Chat and Meet), Google will keep Hangouts available for some time as Chat continues to evolve. One-to-one messages shared in Chat will be visible in Hangouts and vice versa. However, Rooms, screenshots, files, documents, Group messages and invitations to Chat groups will only be shareable in Chat. We encourage you and your teams to transition to Chat so you can easily share and view all parts of the conversations without missing a beat. To chat (starting Monday), visit chat.google.com via your PC (right-click the browser tab to pin it) and download the mobile app from PwC’s App Store or Google Work Play. There’s an easy way to get all the Google apps in PwC’s App Store: tap Categories, then Google Essentials, then ↓ to download the entire suite. A Chat desktop app is coming soon. If you want to learn more: View this short video or read this document Visit the G Suite Learning Center Watch the Google Chat recorded US IT Connect ‘n’ Learn session The fine print: Don’t discuss or post US client and/or engagement related data in Google Chat Rooms. Client work should be documented as required by policy in the system of record for your respective practice. Keep your communications professional. Don’t write anything in Chat that you wouldn’t write in email or other channels. Treat Chat with the same expected standards of professionalism and understanding of risk as you would on other platforms. Posts older than six months in Rooms will be deleted. One-on-one chat and group chat will expire after 24 hours. Be sure to follow the US Google Business Rules when using Chat or other Google collaboration tools. No, we won’t be getting Slack any time soon (doesn’t pass security checks). You should continue to use your current Salesforce Chatter groups to connect with your Account teams and for all Salesforce related information -- Google Chat does not replace Chatter. While we are making Chat available now, rest assured we’re moving fast and innovating to continue to roll out other Chat features in the future. Stay tuned!

Becoming more digitally fit was a great way to add value by automating the data we come across on a daily basis — and telling a better story with that data.” By becoming a Digital Accelerator and using resources in the Digital Hub, Lori has learned to work with data-wrangling tools to save time by automating and accelerating the data that supports the dashboards her team uses to measure and determine office space occupancy firmwide. “We’re now able to automatically download data using data analytics tools to arrive at our space growth projections — eliminating the need to do so manually. It’s now faster and more effective to get this predictive data to the leaders who manage office space,” she says. For Lori, a more digital mindset is just one of the many positive byproducts of embracing technology. “Now I want to automate anything I can get my hands on. A task that took an entire day in the past might now take as little as five minutes, giving me more time to help my team.” Asking better questions through design thinking has been another positive change. “New ways of thinking can help you draw insights in surprisingly new ways.” Lori advises: “Don’t become overwhelmed; take the leap and go for it! Being open minded and not stuck in the same way of doing things is the biggest takeaway for me. I now look for opportunities to use what I’ve learned. And I can’t wait to build a bot. I love how the firm is making an investment in us; it will help us all stay competitive.” "Today Lori is a champion for change and is excited at the possibilities for the future," says Real Estate Strategy Leader Peter Barnett. "She sends our team Harvard Business Review articles on why failure is healthy and urges others to think outside the box. The contributions she'll be able to make in real estate towards the future of our people experience are already being realized." Want to build your own digital skills?

Would our people understand the critical importance of upping our game and building our digital skills so we can stay confident, credible and competitive now and in the future? The answer? A resounding yes! In just three weeks, close to 3,500 people self nominated for the chance to become a Digital Accelerator. We were thrilled by the enthusiasm! The selection committee then went to work to carefully review each nomination -- all of which included essays or videos. And it wasn’t easy. (Get an inside look at clips from some of the video submissions here.) It’s clear that you’re ready to deliver on our Your Tomorrow promise: to digitally enable PwC and secure a future that takes us in exciting new directions. You understand the investment we’re making in you to help develop your skills, while providing the tools and processes you need to reimagine the possible -- and to make your lives easier. And you’re excited to use your new digital knowledge and skills to meet the needs of the market, our clients and our firm. With Your Tomorrow, we’re creating an engine of innovation driven by the combination of our people plus technology. Our Digital Accelerators will help us use technology to innovate on our engagements and meet our clients’ need for more value, a more digital experience at a competitive cost. Here’s our first class of Digital Accelerators -- ready to lift off What’s next for these Digital Accelerators? The first class of Digital Accelerators will begin their mission at one of four world-class Liftoff onboarding sessions, with the first class beginning July 24. Following onboarding, depending on their lines of service/IFS, Digital Accelerators will take what they have learned and continue their training while applying their new knowledge into their assignments on the ground. What’s next for all of us? While the next call for Digital Accelerator self nominations won’t occur until later in FY19, there are many things we all can do now to build our digital skills. For instance, we can continue on our journey to Digital Fitness through the Digital Fitness app and accessing the digital assets in Vantage (while you’re there, sign up for daily tech updates from MIT Tech Review!). And we’ll soon launch a variety of easily consumable Digital Fitness learning assets, delivered in unexpected ways, with the goal of bringing everyone in the firm to the Digital Fitness level by September 2019. We’ll start the launch of this exciting cascade with our “Tech While You Trek” podcast series, within the soon-to-launch PwC Podcast app later this summer. You can find the latest podcasts now by searching “Tech While You Trek” on Vantage. Congratulations to our first class of Digital Accelerators, and good luck to all of you on your digital mission!

Throughout FY19, we’re sharing Real-time recognition tips. In this article, we focus on quick ways to offer recognition during busy times. You may be thinking that with a growing “to-do” list and a limited amount of hours in a day, finding time to recognize colleagues can be challenging. You barely have enough time to read this article, right? Have no fear because Real-time recognition is here! With our tech-enabled tool, you can quickly and easily contribute to our recognition culture and make someone feel valued. Studies show that people who consistently practice gratitude report greater physical, emotional and social well-being. By regularly noticing and appreciating great work in manageable bites, it becomes a simple and enjoyable part of your routine, even with a hectic schedule. Consider the following ways you can easily fit Real-time recognition into your day: Say “thank you” on the go with the Globoforce mobile app. Reminder: If you’re a budget holder, you can find your available spending balance in myMetrics or on the Real-time recognition site. During a quick break, glance at the Recognition activity feed to congratulate a few colleagues — it only takes seconds to have a significant impact on them. If you suddenly remember a colleague deserves gratitude, but you’re about to walk into a meeting, create a calendar reminder to send them recognition at a more convenient time. More info: Budget holders: the second spend period will close on June 27 at 5 p.m. ET — if you don’t use your spending balance by then, you’ll lose it. Visit the Appreciation Bank for ways that our people flex their communication style to express the five languages of appreciation, which helps build deeper relationships with colleagues and clients. Healthy Habits: You can add “Appreciate Others” to your Healthy Habits in Virgin Pulse. Find it under the Emotional dimension in Managing Emotions, and add it to your Healthy Habits for daily tracking. Relationship Leaders: You can see if your assignees have been recognized by clicking the "My team" link on the Recognition home page (based on your Workday supervisory org).

They quickly found out that the lengthy surrogacy process was bumpy and complex and the expense involved would challenge their finances. After one unsuccessful pregnancy, Ryan and his husband were back to the drawing board. Financial challenges risked further delaying their dream of having a family. However, while they were on their journey, firm leadership started discussions regarding potentially providing surrogacy benefits. On July 1, the firm expanded its adoption benefits to include surrogacy. Eligible staff can now be reimbursed up to $25,000 per child for costs associated with adoption and/or surrogacy agreements. Offering this new family care benefit is one way we support all of our families including our LGBT+ parents and part of what helped PwC be named No. 5 on Fortune’s Best Workplace for Parents list. This benefit is already making a significant impact for staff members like Ryan. “Thanks in part to this benefit, we were able to start a second attempt. We were really humbled by the support we received from my local Dallas PCS team during our journey and the firm as a whole. I am just really grateful to work for a firm that continuously aims to do the right thing.” On Aug. 31, 2018, Ryan and his husband joyously welcomed their newborn son, Rory Wilder Layman. Transitioning into his new life as a parent was made easier by the firm’s eight week paternity leave. “Having a newborn is a major change,” Ryan says. “The eight weeks off allowed me to disconnect from work and focus on family. I was able to adjust and transition into fatherhood nicely.” Ryan, who recently returned from his leave, says he doesn’t work less, just differently. “My team made the transition back to work very smooth. I’ve been able to balance priorities while still attending to family when needed. I’m just very appreciative for all the time and flexibility that the firm has given me to get settled with our new addition,” Ryan says. We wish Ryan and his growing family all the best.

Behind the scenes of Di We are IFS: An IFS team in the curator's seat. Behind the scenes of Digital Lab IFS Jan. 3, 2019 “We are IFS” focuses on inspiring stories from our IFS colleagues. What happens when automations are submitted to Digital Lab? Before being published for firmwide use, they first go through the Digital Lab Governance &amp; Curation Team, a group of our IFS colleagues based in Tampa. “Think of Digital Lab as a storefront that houses fantastic automations developed by our own people,” said Director Jay Krames. “When an automation is submitted through Digital Lab, we work closely with the “authors” -- those who submit the automations -- to make sure certain necessary steps are taken before it gets published and becomes available to everyone.” “Our people, IFS and client service teams alike, often create automations for their own projects. The Governance &amp; Curation team’s job is to help evolve and optimize this great work to make it useful and beneficial for everyone at the firm,” Jay continued. Governance is always the first step; this team makes sure each automation meets PwC’s quality and data confidentiality standards (including removal of client data). Then, the team helps post the submission, adding tips and descriptions to help others find and understand the automation. The Governance &amp; Curation team also looks for opportunities to bundle and package individual automations together to enable even broader automation opportunities. “A single automation might save one person six hours; but bundled with similar submissions, we can sometimes lay the groundwork for saving thousands of hours collectively for people across the firm,” said Jay. While returning hours back to the firm and engagement teams is the main goal, monitoring the automations for relevance and quality once they become available to everyone is another. “When automations are published, we keep tabs on the ratings and commentary and pay attention to which automation themes are hot, trending and most used,” Jay says. “It’s a great way for authors and users to interact and for solutions to continue to evolve.” Get more Don’t miss the top five most popular Digital Lab automations for IFS.

He was joined by a panel of leading voices on the topic: Working Mother President Subha Barry, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Ronan Farrow, and HeForShe campaign founder Elizabeth Nyamayaro. The panel engaged in a candid conversation that explored a number of timely societal issues and shared powerful personal experiences that helped shape their views on gender equality. The highlight reel: Elizabeth explained why engaging men is a central focus of HeForShe: “We need male engagement. Because men hold the power in society at all levels: politically, socially, economically — women are underrepresented. So really, the idea is to say, you know, ‘hey guys, let’s work together. This is for all of us.’ Because when women benefit, men benefit as well.” Subha shared her advice from working on Wall Street at a time when very few women did. “I would say to women, especially who are starting out in the business world, you know if you are lucky enough to be able to find a job that measures you objectively and you have the gumption and guts to stand up and barrel through the walls, go for it.” Ronan shared his experience reporting on the #MeToo movement and gave advice to men concerned about being called out: “The fundamental maxim that boils down is pretty simple. Read the room. Read another person. Treat people with respect. That last sentence will get you through everything. Just treat people with respect.” All three panelists demonstrated how one person can make a big difference. Elizabeth summed it up with an African proverb: “If you think you’re too small to make a difference, try sleeping in a room with a mosquito.” If you missed the webcast or would like to watch it again, click here to access a replay.

Verizon Connect expanded its capabilities in fleet management and connected vehicles with two recent acquisitions. Post merger, Verizon Connect recognized the need to standardize sales, marketing and service processes and clean up leftover technical and duplicative processes. Our client saw the challenge of driving this transformation while maintaining business as usual for their day to day operations. How did we propose to solve the client’s problem? Leveraging the Sales &amp; Marketing Excellence (S&amp;ME) and Anything as a Service (XaaS) Integrated Solutions, our team looked beyond the technology and put the end user experience first. We brought the Sales, Marketing and Service teams at Verizon together with the technology team to collaborate early and often. Our PwC team proposed a “Global Standard” process upfront, aligning all stakeholders on how the teams would operate globally, and demonstrating that we could lay the proper foundation for their continued growth. We developed a standardized process to enable global consistency and business flexibility, meet the unique needs of the two business units targeted at small and medium business, versus Enterprise. What started as a $4M engagement has expanded to $10M+ by identifying opportunities to: Enhance the Salesforce experience. Transform Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) and Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM) processes. Increase &amp; improve the use of analytics. Additional projects related to helping Verizon Connect’s ability to sell. What outcome will our client see? We are projecting to achieve: Aggressive growth targets Standardized end-to-end processes for sales, marketing and customer service Reduction in license costs Improved cross-application visibility of key sales information (pipeline, client data, after sale activities) Though we’re mid-transformation, we’ve already reduced technical complexity of the end state Salesforce CRM (rationalized hundreds of fields simplifying the UX).

After learning about a 20+ year civil war that ravaged the country and tore families apart, Angie felt compelled to help the defenseless children caught in the middle. A simple Google search for volunteer opportunities in Uganda would be the beginning of a 10-year relationship she established with BULA (Better Understanding of Life in Africa), a nonprofit that empowers children and youth in vulnerable situations. After joining PwC in 2015, Angie was able to remain active with BULA and provide even more support. “I’m grateful to work for a firm and team that values making a difference,” she said. “With flexibility, Impact Space and Dollars for Doers, I’m continuing my work to solve an important problem -- ensuring children grow up in loving, protective families, not institutions.” Taking advantage of the firm’s unprescribed community investment time and the firmwide holiday shutdown, Angie traveled from Austin, Texas, to Kampala, Uganda, for three weeks to visit with BULA staff and help them plan for the new year. In addition to running various workshops, Angie made the holiday season special for sponsored students and youths by organizing social gatherings, preparing gifts and spending quality time with her new friends. Angie credits the firm for making her a more valuable volunteer and professional. “I have been able to further develop our staff in Uganda and the young adults I work with by leveraging what I’ve learned from PwC’s development approach,” she said. To date, thanks to the generosity of her colleagues, Angie has raised $1,750 for BULA's Uganda Care Leavers (UCL) initiative — a social welfare project designed to support children, youths and adults who have spent all or part of their childhood in institutional care. The funds raised will allow for BULA to host more training and workshops, reach out to additional care leavers and generate a robust report to share with other key NGOs and stakeholders so that childcare services can improve globally. Check out this short video to learn more about BULA. Do you have a story to share? Let us know.

Protection of confidential data is part of having a One Firm disciplined approach to how we provision, store, secure, use, expose and access data. This is an increasingly sensitive area for our clients, and this change is being made to enhance our data-protection controls. Data governance is at the heart of the firm’s strategy and is an underpinning of digital enablement. What’s changing? Saving files to any sort of removable media device, including firm-issued encrypted USB drives, will no longer be permitted. You will be able to transfer files from an encrypted device to your PC; however, changes cannot be saved back to the device from your PC. How will this impact my work? We anticipate minimal impact to partners and staff. Several engagement teams are already using secure sites within their line of service or client-specific web applications to share data. A list of preferred methods of data transmittal and collaboration tools is available in Spark. What if a client gives me a USB flash drive? Many clients are also moving away from the use of removable media devices. However, if you do need to access data from a client-issued USB, you will be able to save files from the encrypted device to your PC. What if my PC is not big enough to hold all of my files? Our new Windows 10 PCs have far more storage space than our previous PCs. You should review your files at the end of each engagement or project, save all documentation to the appropriate system of record and dispose of any files that are not subject to retention. What if there is an urgent situation, and I absolutely need to use removable media? While these instances are expected to be limited, it is understandable that there may be situations where a removable media device is the only solution. Temporary permission may be requested by reviewing policy guidance and submitting a security exception request with appropriate approval. More details about this process will be available soon. #PwCUSIT Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/39306.html</url><pwc_title>Reminder: Tax staff comp &amp; CRT webcast this Thursday</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 11:42:07</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:TaxTtes|source:Tax</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-04-24 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>Tax</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Reminder: Tax staff comp &amp; CRT webcast this Thursday Reminder: Tax staff comp &amp; CRT webcast this Thursday Tax April 24, 2019 Join Tax People Leader Nik Shah and Tax Operations Leader Mark Borden on April 25 from 3 - 4 p.m. ET for a discussion on our rewards strategy, YTD results and Career Roundtable process.

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use our technology tools and Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Your Tomorrow is driving quality, adding value and creating opportunities for our people to develop skills that make a difference, in and outside the firm. We sat down with two PwCers, Heather Meloy and Conor McManus, who are using new digital capabilities to solve important problems for their clients and their communities. How have you approached your digital upskilling journey? Heather: “I lead our giving program, and immediately saw opportunities to use data analytics and the firm’s new technology tools. By using visualizations and automations, I’ve been able to spend time on more meaningful work instead of just data management.” Conor: “The pace of change is increasing, and the firm is keeping up with Continuous Improvement and Your Tomorrow. By cutting unnecessary time and building my own skills , I feel like I’m working smarter and better. The benefits of automation are clear. Plus, it makes the job more interesting and less mundane.” How are you using your skills to deliver on our purpose and make a difference? Heather: “I am always looking for new ways to bring digital skills to my work on the Responsible Business Leadership team. For instance, we know our people are making charitable donations outside of our firm giving site and that it can be cumbersome to log them all, so I’m working on a bot that will read those receipts and automatically upload them. I’ve been able to automate much of our reporting to leadership and provide insights to continually make data-driven decisions when evaluating our programs.” Conor: “I have a client that is interested in introducing technology tools to take out manual effort. Our team has been able to talk to our client about their journey, and we have the right skills to review their work. We even had a Tax Senior Associate, Danny Engelman, who was able to go toe-to-toe with the client’s director on the technology. If we don’t learn now, we will fall behind our clients. Outside the firm, I also volunteer for the alumni board for my high school, and I noticed they had a ton of ugly data around donations. In my spare time, I signed up for free personal versions of the technology tools, used my new digital skills and put together a visualization for the board that depicts a summary of donations in one picture – by graduating class, average amount, etc. The data jumped off the page, helping them strategize their marketing. They were blown away by the presentation method. The president even said he would have paid for an output like this.” How do your teams play a role? Heather: “We are all excited and have encouraged each other to hone our skills. Everyone is stretched for time and has wide ranging tasks. To feasibly do it all, we need to learn how to automate. Plus, by creating workflows and solutions that we can hand off between each other, we eliminate the bottleneck of only one person knowing how to do something.” Conor: “On my team, we’ve been trying to implement as much as we can, balancing busy schedules. We have already had some easy, quick wins like cleaning up Excel reports automatically, and have been keeping a running list of solutions we want to build when time permits.” Any advice for other PwCers? Heather: “It is daunting to learn and understand new technologies and apply them to your work. But, no one is going to ask you to build a robot tomorrow. Take the first step by learning about the Essential Eight and some use cases. Just understanding what is possible is a great start.” (Click here to learn more about the essential eight.) Conor: “No one became an Excel pro in one day — take small steps. I started off by attending a Digital Academy, then bookmarked some other self-service trainings to complete as I could and talked to team members as well. It is like getting a new phone — the best way to figure it out is playing around with it.” Have you already earned 150 points in Digital Lab, fulfilling that portion of the Learn2earn challenge?

Mapper has a conversion feature Previously mapped to Tax Form Lines? Mapper has a conversion feature Tax April 22, 2019 “I have already mapped my client’s chart of accounts to tax forms. Now you are asking me to spend more time mapping just so I can use Mapper or Tax Adjustments? How will this save me time?” Re-Introducing: the Mapper Conversion utility. If you have previously mapped a client’s chart of accounts or trial balances to tax form lines, but you want to use Mapper or Tax Adjustments, you can use the Mapper Conversion utility to give yourself a head start. Mapper is able to convert mappings from the following tax form systems: Corptax and CTR/Onesource - The conversion utility will create the chart of accounts (including automating assigning the account type) and generate the account map. During the generation of the account map, Mapper will do a one to one comparison between the standard Corptax and CTR/Onesource accounts and map them to that corresponding account in Mapper. If you have created a user defined taxonomy in Corptax or CTR/Onesource, Mapper will run those accounts through its machine learning algorithm to map them to one of the standard taxonomies. Gosystem Bridge - The conversion utility will create the chart of accounts (including automating assigning of the account type) and generate the account map. Because the Gosystem Bridge does not have a standard taxonomy, Mapper will run all accounts through its machine learning algorithm to map them to a standard taxonomy. Check out the Mapper Release Notes to learn about all the features Mapper has to offer. Have an idea for new features? Submit your suggestions to the Mapper and Tax Adjustments Idea portal. More than 100 end-user ideas have already been implemented. How to get help Submit a ticket: Create a US IT Support Request through the Service Now hub.

I know many are coming out of some of the busiest weeks of the year -- thank you for all your great work! What has me excited is watching our progress on Your Tomorrow. I’m excited because all of us are learning new skills to help us in our careers and because we are investing in ourselves so we stay relevant as technology becomes more and more integral to everything we do. As you know, we’ve set an ambitious goal to have everyone complete four Digital Quests this fiscal year and in doing so, earn their Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30. Since all the Digital Quests became available three weeks ago, 12,000 of us have reached the goal and earned our badges! That’s exciting -- but we are going for 100%. As an added incentive to reach our goals early, and to have some fun along the way, we launched Learn2earn in January, right after the holiday break. To be part of Learn2Earn you need to do two things by April 30: Complete all four Digital Quests -- which are now available on the Digital Hub. Earn a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points. All eligible staff who complete these two asks by April 30 will have a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win! Team, what I often say is when we do the right things for our people and our clients, then our business will do well. And this year, as we focus on improving our skills and listening to our clients’ needs, we are tracking close to our goals -- but we need everyone contributing in the last quarter to reach our targets. With revenue of $12 billion so far, we’re slightly behind our goals for revenue and engagement margin (our measure of profitability). We’ve made tremendous progress this year but we need to stay focused on running our business well right through June. It’s going to take all of us doing our part to reach our revenue goals and manage the bottom line by spending wisely, using Global Delivery Centers and finding new ways to work smarter using technology. I’m looking forward to wrapping up the year and celebrating together. July Fourth will be here before we know it, and by then we’ll have new skills and a more digital firm, and a week-long break to relax and recharge. Thanks for keeping the momentum going for these last three months -- and please check out the updates from each of our lines of service and IFS so we all understand how we contribute to our success.

This can be an effective means of managing the Responsible Partner’s (as identified in CES) pre-approval obligations and can be extremely helpful in achieving compliance with firm policy. As background, many audit clients have a Pre-approval Framework Agreement in place, which is an approach used to obtain and document audit committee pre-approval for recurring or known (at the time of preparing the Framework) tax services to be provided to the client during the audit engagement period. For example, tax compliance and tax compliance related services provided annually and other types of detailed, pre-defined tax consulting services, may be included in a client’s Pre-Approval Framework Agreement to obtain Audit Committee pre-approval well in advance of actually engaging to provide the services. In these cases, the Framework AFS can be obtained after Audit Committee pre-approval is granted and should mirror the client’s Pre-approval Framework Agreement’s detailed scope of services for those pre-approved non-audit services. An approved Framework AFS will provide the necessary approvals to “clear the way” for engagement teams to be engaged to provide previously pre-approved tax services as requested by the client. However, care should be used to ensure that the non-audit services that are being provided clearly fall under the Framework AFS. In many cases, the Responsible Partner may still request that a separate AFS also be submitted as each project kicks off for notification/tracking purposes. If a separate AFS is requested, a best practice that should be considered is to also reference the Framework AFS at that time. Tax engagement teams should discuss with the respective Responsible Partner the procedures to be followed to obtain pre-approval for any non-audit services to be provided to their restricted clients and/or their affiliates, including whether a Pre-approval Framework Agreement has been agreed to with the client and the relevant PCAOB Rule 3524 communications have been made. If a Pre-approval Framework Agreement is not being used for your restricted client and/or their affiliate, consider having a discussion with the Responsible Partner regarding the use of a Pre-approval Framework Agreement approach.

Run a racing Grand Prix! The idea came to PwC Senior Manager Mark Diment and Manager Lizzie Tucker, members of the Private Company Services (PCS) Assurance Technology Team, when they attended the Alteryx Inspire conference in June and saw how they used a racing-themed competition to engage attendees. “It was fun, people really got into it,” said Mark, “and we knew we had to bring this back to PCS.” That’s how the idea hatched in PCS, to inspire Associates and Senior Associates to learn about Alteryx by participating in a PwC version of the Grand Prix. To participate, individuals earned a Ninja Green Belt by completing Learning Path 1 in the Path to Alteryx Ninja. Then they participated in a qualifying round to narrow the field down to the four finalists who would compete on stage in front of the Sector Conference audience of PCS Managers and Partners. No pressure! Who made it to the final round? Senior Associate Nozomu Hida (NY), Experienced Associate Na Li (Philadelphia), Experienced Associate Kevin Frank (Cincinnati), and Senior Associate Omar Moreno (San Antonio) representing PCS’ New York Metro, East, Midwest, and West regions, respectively. All were new to using Alteryx and just started learning the tool in July. On stage, under the bright lights and in front of a cheering crowd, they used Alteryx to devise solutions to trial balance and financial statement tie-out challenges. Nozomu crossed the finish line with the most points and took home the PCS Alteryx Grand Prix Champion title (along with other cool prizes). Having just downloaded and started to use Alteryx in the last few months, Nozomu commented: “Once you learn the basics, it gets easier and easier from there. It’s a very powerful tool.” Nozomu Hida (center), PCS Senior Associate from NY Metro and newly crowned PCS Alteryx Champion with Zac Perkins, Customer Success Manager from Alteryx (left) and Mark Flavell (right), PCS Assurance Transformation Leader.

Trying to process such tragic news was extremely difficult. “I received the news nobody ever wants to hear,” Colin reflected. “The diagnosis in September 2017 left us with two options: Become another sad statistic, or battle cancer and live every moment to the fullest. We chose the latter.” Colin shared the information with his colleagues and was overwhelmed by their support. “I am fortunate to work at PwC,” he said. “My partners and team provided the flexibility I needed to attend GJ’s radiation treatments and doctor visits. The firm always put my family’s needs first.” Colin also credits Be well, work well for helping him get through this difficult journey. “My brother’s situation began to take a toll on my energy,” Colin said. “In order to provide GJ the best support possible, I had to take care of myself, as well. I reviewed many of the firm’s Be well, work well assets, and based on some suggestions, I got into hot yoga and trained for the NYC marathon. It helped keep my mind sharp and spirits up.” Colin’s training paid off: He ran in the 2018 NYC marathon. The brothers recently hiked the Grand Canyon, and GJ returned to work full-time. Then in December, a routine scan revealed a recurrence of GJ’s tumor, requiring emergency surgery. Still, the family soldiers on and continues to support GJ and work to raise awareness. “We live scan to scan,” Colin said, “but we’re enjoying every moment possible and defying the odds. Our refusal to become another statistic has inspired others as well.” Colin’s family established StacheStrong, a 501(c)3 Not-for-Profit charity, to raise funds for brain cancer research. Since its launch 10 months ago, they have raised over $65,000 and gained some celebrity notoriety. They were invited to a taping of The View to meet the cast and they joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the annual Biden Cancer Summit in Washington, DC. A documentary on the StacheStrong story was just released by Road ID. If you wish to contribute to StacheStrong, please visit PwC’s Impact Space. We wish GJ and his family all the best in his battle. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: Talk with your teams about your well-being and flexibility needs, even during busy times. You don’t get it if you don’t plan for it, so hold one another accountable! Our Flexibility2 and Be well, work well sites provide tips and best practices.

We’ve got a bot for that (and 2 ways to earn with One-click hoteling? We’ve got a bot for that (and 2 ways to earn with Digital Lab) HQ News Feb. 7, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Commute, coffee, hotel into desk — all steps to starting your day. Save time in your routine by hoteling in one click with the Hoteling Reservation Automation from Digital Lab. The bot opens the hoteling portal and navigates through the screens to log you into the last desk you used. It also makes future reservations for the same desk. We talked to the team — Caleb Scott, Christian Engel, Eileen O'Neill, Jason King and John Scott — to learn more about the Hoteling Reservation Automation. PwC Inside: How did you come up with the idea for the Hoteling Reservation Automation? Jason: Hoteling is a unique routine for all PwCers, and is part of our strategy. Because this is part of our people’s daily lives, it was no surprise that three separate groups across the firm were already working on trying to automate it at the same time. All of our teams had gotten to the same place but took a different approach. And via the Digital Lab launch, we were able to combine them all for a far better product together. John: With Digital Lab, we’ve been able to meet and work with different people from across the firm and get the automation in front of everyone. And with the Digital Lab team reviews, we were able to add new functionality. What has the feedback been? Christian: When Digital Lab launched firmwide, the bot crashed for many at first and did not have great reviews from people using it. We learned about the bugs from user reviews and needed to make some fixes. Since then, we’ve been getting five-star reviews and are one of the top-downloaded assets. The Digital Lab platform allows us to follow up directly with people about their experience, which has been great. Jason: I think the thing people like most about this bot is that you can run it while you’re doing other things. It’s flexible and doesn’t take over your whole screen like some bots can. Eileen: We value the comments people make so much, because it allows us to add features, improve and iterate. John: For example, one of our big new features is adding out-of-office days, so you can skip reservations those days. We’ve also been asked to think about how the bot can help us make sure we cancel reservations when we don’t need them to free up space for others. We’re increasing the robustness and fixing regular issues as they come up. Were there challenges? Caleb: Because we were bringing together three different groups and their ideas, we had upfront challenges with picking what functionality worked best. And since not everyone has the same pattern of in-office days and the technologies we use vary, we had to do a lot of testing on different computers with different screen resolution, trying to make it work for everyone across the firm. Have you submitted anything else to Digital Lab? Jason: I have worked on a sales tax-specific automation and some other Tax functional assets with Digital Accelerators and Tax teams. We’re always looking for opportunities to submit to Digital Lab. There is so much to learn from on the site as well — trying new visualizations and the styles people use. Caleb: I also like to download other assets just to see how the builders go about certain things. As more of the firm starts using it, the assets become more dynamic. There are samples and templates that anyone can use, no matter your role -- not just one-off LoS-specific solutions. Jason: There are so many resources on Digital Lab. For any Tax form, there is probably a solution to make it easier on there. Even if you don't have something in mind to fix, the community gives you ideas for saving time and making improvements -- downloading or making your own. Do you know how you will use your Digital Lab rewards? Christian: No one is going to say no to extra rewards, but honestly for me, seeing it on the leaderboard and using it everyday myself is the reward. I love the competition piece of Digital Lab and the challenge to make it better. Eileen: It is a great addition to your bank account, but you can also see the firm investment in upskilling paying off. I had a call the other day to use the bot as a presentation demo, and seeing it used as a model was a big reward. Anything else you’d like to add? We would also like to acknowledge the important role our colleague, Matt Mancuso (NE Tax DA), had in this project. Matt found his true passion in the Digital Accelerator program and quickly became adept at creating bots such as this. Matt passed away in November 2018 and is deeply missed. He was an alum of Wake Forest University, and a scholarship in his name has been established by his family and PwC. More details on the scholarship and how to donate are here. Have you already earned 150 points in Digital Lab, fulfilling that portion of the Learn2earn challenge?

The forces of change are widening the gap between those who have opportunities and those who do not. As a purpose-led, values-driven organization, we have the ability — and responsibility — to “mind the gap.” Serving on a nonprofit board is one way you can contribute. It gives you the opportunity to sharpen your digital and leadership skills, help an organization you’re passionate about deliver on its mission, and offer tech-driven solutions to some of society's greatest challenges. So, what exactly does it mean to join a nonprofit board? How can you be an effective board member? We address these questions and more in six training videos. You don’t have to be a partner or director to serve on a nonprofit board — nonprofits often seek professionals at all levels, and they benefit from generational diversity. Making a difference Check out what a few of your colleagues have been up to: For New York senior manager Amma Osei, serving on the board of Oliver Scholars is a way to contribute her unique perspective and professional experience, and serve as a voice for underrepresented students. Cleveland manager Kimberly Heinendeveloped a deeper understanding of some of the challenges our clients are facing through her work as Board Treasurer for She’s the First. For Chicago senior associate Alex Kapustka, working with Chicago Commons was an opportunity to step up as a leader. Amma, Kimberly and Alex are each receiving a $100 credit in Impact Space as a thank you for sharing their stories. Have a story to share? To be considered for future articles, please visit Impact Space and tell us how you mind the gap. Charging your time All nonprofit board service time should be charged to the appropriate WBS code.

Throughout FY19, we’re sharing Real-time recognition tips. In this article, we focus on what to recognize. We all know the value of recognition -- it drives engagement and increases productivity, boosts morale and builds relationships. With our tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool, we’ve made it easy for you to drive our recognition culture and make gratitude part of every day. But do you ever wonder what, exactly, you should be recognizing? If so, ask yourself the following questions: Is the behavior something you’d like to see the person do more often? If you see something great that you want the person to keep doing, recognize it in the moment -- recognition and reward are the purest and most powerful forms of positive feedback. Is the action something you’d like to see others doing? When you see a colleague doing something you want others to emulate, show appreciation for it right away. You can also use the Recognition activity feed to congratulate others on what you value most. Does it embody our firm’s values? When you see behavior that aligns with our values, call it out to show the recipient and your team what that looks like. Did it make your life easier? This may seem personal, but so is recognition. When a colleague is thoughtful and makes a big impact because they gave you their time, attention or energy, make sure they know it’s appreciated. More info: Healthy Habits: You can add “Appreciate Others” to your Healthy Habits in Virgin Pulse. Find it under the Emotional dimension in Managing Emotions, and add it to your Healthy Habits for daily tracking. Budget holders: The second spend period started Jan. 17; if you’re a budget holder, half of your annual budget has been added to the system (you will see your available balance during the recognition process on your PC). $25 award: Based on your feedback, we’ve added the option to recognize staff in the US with a $25 award. If you recognize staff in other territories, they will receive the same award level at a value in their home-country denomination. Relationship Leaders: You can see whether your assignees have been recognized by clicking the “My team” link on the Recognition home page. Keep an eye out for future installments of our tips series.

In short, we’ve refreshed and simplified how we use our brand, while making it easier to work with all the elements, particularly in today’s mobile-first, digital environment. And bonus — because we’ve kept all the core visual elements of our brand (same logo, fonts, color palette, etc.), there’s no need to change anything you’ve created in the past. Similarly, Strategy&amp; has refreshed its look. The team is also evolving its core message to differentiate the Strategy&amp; business even further, and building a brand story focused on strategy, made real – creating strategies that are built to deliver results and value for our clients, right from the start. How can I get my hands on the latest? Our US Creative Team and the Document Development Center (DDC) are already delivering new requests in the updated templates, and the DDC is a great resource to help update existing materials. You can also feel free to use the new Global Google Slides templates (or access through Chrome Managed bookmarks &gt; G Suite Apps &gt; PwC Templates) — scroll down to access the PwC US versions, which have the correct disclaimer language already in place. And easy-to-grab graphic elements have been added to the “Global” section. US IT is deploying the new Microsoft PowerPoint templates firmwide throughout February. To check if you’ve got the latest, open PowerPoint on your desktop, navigate to the “PwC Toolbox” tab &gt; “New Presentation.” The new template prominently features a gray and orange color scheme on its cover.

This will help our clients more easily get the content they want from us, when they want it and how they want it (by industry, service offering and other topics). Register using a personal email address if you’d like to experience it yourself. Along with providing a better, more digital experience for our clients, the preference center provides us better data and insights about what’s resonating in the market. We will also regularly reach out via email campaigns to clients and contacts, asking them to share their latest interests -- helping us do a better job of delivering the right PwC points of view, at the right time. And most importantly, the digital preference center allows a user to provide marketing consent, playing an essential role in our continued compliance with privacy regulations such as the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). How can your clients benefit? Know what your clients and contacts are receiving from us -- and help improve the relevance of the content we deliver digitally. Salesforce users can easily see which marketing publications their contacts already receive (and which events/webcasts they registered to attend). Remember -- not all of our database contacts are in Salesforce, but you can contact your local Geo marketer for a view of the contacts in our Eloqua (marketing automation) tool. Encourage your clients to sign up. Send this draft email to your key contacts, reinforcing the messages they'll be receiving from us to use the Preference Center to indicate the services, industries and topics of interest to them. Our policy is that we do not add clients to our mailings without the client taking action.

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Lisa Acevedo, Senior Associate in External Communications, based out of the New York office. I’ve been with the firm for 30 years. What’s a typical day for you? It starts with scouring the news! I look for trending stories that would benefit from a PwC mention or align with a PwC platform. We then decide which opportunities to explore and work to “pitch” our PwC leaders to key reporters. Understanding the news cycle and building trusting relationships with reporters is a big part of my day, along with making sure we tap into channels like LinkedIn and Facebook to optimize PwC content and find ways to feature our people. How did your journey lead you to this role? An unstoppable desire to learn! I joined the firm as an Executive Assistant with the college recruiting team where I became immersed in everything from setting up interviews to travel coordination to welcome receptions. Then the opportunity came to join Global and US Marketing working on myKcurve and other portal projects. I loved learning about content marketing, website analytics and social media. What followed was a Senior Associate role on the Marketing &amp; Sales Creative team focusing on the PwC external website. In 2014, when a role opened up in Social Media -- now External Communications -- I was intrigued, although my first thought was, “I’m not even on Facebook!” But once again, my curiosity and desire to learn and grow took over and I love handling external media for Tax with yet another wonderful, supportive team. The one constant in my PwC career has been working with amazing teams and forging -- and maintaining -- great relationships. How does your team bring value to PwC? We’re responsible for external media relations and social media strategy, so we help drive visibility for the firm, our PwC leaders and subject matter experts in the market by pitching stories and creating campaigns that have a natural tie-in with the latest news. Finding ways to leverage PwC’s reports, surveys, initiatives and case studies is our passion, and how we help build PwC’s brand in the marketplace. Anyone who speaks to the press on behalf of the firm has to participate in media training, and we handle that, too. Training is one-on-one and we cover everything imaginable to make sure our people are comfortable before an interview of any kind, as well as put their best foot forward on social media. It’s very rewarding to get our leaders “camera ready” and help them shine! What might we be surprised to learn about you? My love affair with New York City! I live in Rockland County, New York, with my husband, three kids and our dog, but on weekends we love exploring NYC, which is only 20 minutes away. From Broadway shows to dinner at Carmine’s to street fairs to yoga and spin classes, I love everything the city has to offer. And I can’t forget a shout out to my favorite Mexican New York restaurant, Rosa Mexicano; if you go, don’t forget to order the tableside guacamole -- and maybe a margarita!

As the next important step to prepare for the August launch of Workday, we ask that you update your TalentLink profile by July 31. At that point, the Education and Professional Credentialsyou have listed on TalentLink will be added into your Workday profile*. But don’t stop there! Take a few extra minutes to update other sections of your TalentLink profile with your latest skills, experiences and interests. Did anything new or pertinent come up during your Career Outlook discussion? Add it! We’ve made it easier to find digital skills in TalentLink. Simply search for “Digital Skills” in the Technical Skills section, and choose from the list of skills automatically displayed on screen. The digital skills you’re gaining on our Digital Fitness journey are a great addition to your profiles, so be sure to add these skills and describe your experience in applying them. Our clients want to partner with a firm whose people are experienced in the latest technologies. So add your digital skills and keep the learning going! TalentLink is a great tool for relationship leaders and career coaches to better understand your skills, experiences and interests. Your TalentLink Profile is the best way to communicate your brand. It’s a good way to make sure you can be found for opportunities and projects to achieve your career goals, and it helps us staff opportunities across the firm and the PwC network. Take a look at this PwC Inside article for more information and resources on updating your TalentLink profile. *Note that other information about staff in PeopleSoft will also transition to Workday when we go live. In preparation for this change, PeopleSoft will go into view-only mode starting Aug. 1 for all staff. If you have any personal information -- new address, name change, emergency contact -- that needs to be updated, please make the change in PeopleSoft by July 31. Starting Aug. 20, you can update this information -- and more -- in Workday. For urgent changes to personal information between Aug. 1 and Aug. 20, please contact the HR Shared Services Center at (1-877-792-4357, option 4).

What do I mean by that? I mean that if we do the right things for our people and our clients, then strong results will follow. First and foremost, we’re investing in you through Your Tomorrow. Everywhere I travel I talk to teams who are making exciting progress on our citizen-led innovation and using our new tools and knowledge to change how we work. Your Tomorrow is good for each of us as we learn new skills AND it is good for our clients. We can help in the second half of the year by keeping the momentum going. As we talked about during the town hall in October – we want to change at scale. That means ALL of us completing the Digital Quests, using Digital Lab and looking at the work we do through the lens of Your Tomorrow to see how we can drive even more quality, value and efficiency. Plus, as you heard on Monday, our “Learn2earn” challenge gives us another reason to get excited and to be leaders of our digital change. The more time we invest, the more skilled we become! And because we’re doing the right things -- focusing on improving our skills and listening to our clients’ needs -- we’re seeing good financial results. Specifically from a firmwide perspective, our revenues of $7.3 billion are tracking slightly ahead of budget -- with all three lines of service focused on achieving their full-year revenue growth goals. In addition, our key measure of profitability -- engagement margin -- is also slightly ahead of budget. Our financial results tie directly to our ability to reward you and invest for the future. So please check out the updates from Maria Moats, Mohamed Kande, Roy Weathers and Jim Flanagan to understand how we each contribute to our success in the second half of the year by investing in ourselves and passionately serving our clients. Team, coming back from the break, I could not be more energized about where we’re headed. This is our time -- to do great work for our clients and to grab the opportunities for growth and learning as we transform and digitize our business. We would not be where we are without your hard work -- THANK YOU!

It represents just one of the ways we're digitizing our business with Your Tomorrow and using technology to simplify your work life. Since its initial release last summer, Phoenix has rolled out in phases to more than 5,500 engagement teams across our lines of service. If you’re not already using Phoenix to request and manage work with our Service Delivery Centers and Centers of Excellence, you will be very soon! Over the next few months, we’ll finish bringing our remaining Envoy users on to Phoenix. Read on for more about when and how Phoenix is coming to your part of the business, and what you can do to prepare. The latest release In the latest version of Phoenix, users have the ability to customize service delivery schedules, benefit from new reporting features powered by PwC’s data platform (the same technology that powers the “build” capabilities in Digital Lab) — and Phoenix will now pull Salesforce data to auto-populate Service Delivery Center requests (Advisory only). Check out the release notes for our April 3.0 release and our May 3.1 release for more details on the latest new features and visit our Phoenix site for QRCs, videos, FAQs and support. Phoenix has evolved from last summer’s version 1.0, and is getting better and better with each release. As Phoenix continues on its agile development journey, we’re getting great suggestions from our early adopters — which means we’re adding even more functionality into our product roadmap. Continue to watch PwC Inside for updates on each release, and keep sharing your feedback on how we can make Phoenix work best for you! Phoenix in the lines Advisory Phoenix enhances the way we work by creating a centralized way to engage with our Delivery Centers, decreasing back and forth emails and providing greater transparency into our interactions. Starting April 8, Advisory teams will use Phoenix to make the initial connection with our Delivery Centers during the pursuit process. Get more on Phoenix in Advisory. Assurance Over 50 Assurance teams and our Cash COE are already using Phoenix and, later this year, all remaining Assurance teams will make the transition. Watch PwC Inside for updates on Phoenix in Assurance. IFS This summer, IFS will begin transitioning those groups currently using Envoy to Phoenix. Phoenix is still in consideration for IFS groups currently using other workflow platforms. Connect with your IFS functional leader if you think Phoenix might be a fit for your team. Tax All Tax engagement teams that previously used Envoy are now using Phoenix to make reservations. They’re also using Phoenix for workflow and to submit work to their SDC teams — tasks previously done via email. Get more on Phoenix in Tax.

The event was The Atlantic’s Future of Work Conference, where our team talked to more than 400 business leaders about Your Tomorrow and Access Your Potential® (AYP). Watch the inspiring 10-minute conversation here. “Digital starts with people first,” Tim said. With help from Senior Associate Scott Grossnickle and Project Manager Patricia Miller, both Digital Accelerators, he explained how we’re investing in people both inside and outside the walls of PwC. “I didn’t come to PwC with a technical background, but I realized we could do more and add more value by learning these skills,” Scott said. He and Patricia shared their excitement with helping their colleagues, our clients and our firm innovate for the future. “As a business, we believe we have a responsibility to do our part in ensuring that tomorrow’s workforce is competitive and has the right skills for the jobs of the future,” Tim said, connecting our purpose and values to our commitment to upskilling. He explained how PwC worked with teachers in recent months to design a free version of our Digital Fitness Assessment (DFA) app to help them build their digital skills and show them how to share what they learn with their students. The DFA app, CODE-E the robot and other Access Your Potential materials are designed to engage students in actively practicing the types of skills that will be required for tomorrow’s in-demand jobs like coding, robotics and RPA, and performing data analysis. Now available to educators via the Apple App Store or Google Play, the Digital Fitness app will play a central role in helping AYP reach its goal to train 100,000 teachers and guidance counselors. Like the firm’s version, the DFA app starts with a self-assessment to help educators gauge where their digital skills stand. They’ll receive a score and personalized learning feed with recommended learning assets to help them grow their digital IQ. Share with teachers you know You can share the app with educators in your network by using this email template. Please refer to the DFA Application Overview for more details and registration instructions for educators. If educators encounter issues at registration, they should contact the DFA Support Desk (us_dfa_servicedesk@pwc.com) or at 1-800-337-1978. How to get involved in helping students through AYP To make Access Your Potential a success, all of us need to play a role in helping students, especially those from underserved communities, adapt to a rapidly changing world. The best part is that teaching others is a great way to strengthen your own skills. Visit Impact Space to find an AYP volunteer opportunity near you, or visit AYP to learn more.

The report explores how organizations can become better risk takers while navigating digital transformation. The study found that risk functions with greater digital fitness are more effective at helping their stakeholders become smarter risk takers, leading to the following benefits: Faster progress on their digital journey More confidence in taking risks consistent with their strategies More effective management of transformation-related risks More value from their digital investments than anticipated The study also found the most digitally-fit risk functions (a group that we’re calling the “Dynamics”) display these six habits: 1. Go all in on the organization’s digital plan 2. Upskill and inject new talent to move at the speed of the organization 3. Find the right fit for emerging technologies 4. Enable the organization to act on risks in real time 5. Actively engage decision makers of key digital initiatives 6. Collaborate and align to provide a consolidated view of risks In conjunction with the Risk in Review Study, we also released tailored insights in our 2019 State of the Internal Audit Profession and State of Compliance digital reports. All three studies tie back to PwC’s broader thought leadership on the 4IR, Workforce of the Future, and Trusted Tech.

For 11 years, PwC’s Tampa office has been hosting Camelot Youth Summits, a program dedicated to helping high school students in the foster care system prepare for the future. "Most are living in group homes,” explains Director Frank Spinelli, who co-leads the program along with Manager Valerie Lenegar. “But at 18 they ‘age out’ of the system and have to leave those homes. We try to help them learn the life skills they need to succeed when they’re on their own.” The event features guest panelists who were once foster children themselves. Advice ranges from writing resumes and polishing interview skills (a firm handshake is important -- so is eye contact!) to managing finances and becoming digitally fit. “The panelists share stories of how they were helped by the same advice when they were that age,” says Valerie. “There’s nothing like a peer to get you to listen. They tell the kids what to take seriously -- and why.” The program was such a success, that two years ago Senior Manager Gary Montoute and Senior Associate Maria Lohle decided to expand it by adding quarterly workshops in addition to the annual Youth Summit. “There were so many PwC volunteers who wanted to help these kids,” says Gary. “We saw a vital need to extend our impact, and ran with it.” The quarterly programs are highly interactive and take place at a local organization serving over 200 local foster homes. “We aim to give these kids a fighting chance,” says Marie. “And now there are even more opportunities throughout the year to show we care.” The impact has been powerful; students enjoy seeking familiar faces at the sessions and developing bonds of trust with volunteers. And the panelists, all alumni of the Youth Summit, come back year after year, with a clear message: “Here’s where we are now, with jobs and degrees. Even if you hit rock bottom and don’t know where to turn, we can tell you how to persevere; it gets better.” "Our volunteers are passionate about sharing their first-hand success stories and are living proof that this program can make a difference,” says Valerie. “The bottom line is that these kids need advocates,” says Frank. “We rejoice when we hear them say, ‘I listened to what you said and applied it to my life.’ That’s music to our ears.” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between July 1, 2018, and September 30, 2018, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including Section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include Section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Generally, the threshold amount for a Section 165 loss is $10 million in a single year for corporations and partnerships with only corporate partners and $2 million for all other partnerships, S corporations, and individuals. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual including via a partnership or S corporations) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transactions Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC Policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

This week I sent a letter to nearly 1,000 CEOs and business leaders, you can read it below. This is something I do several times a year. I think about the many conversations I have with business leaders -- and pull out the themes that I think they would find helpful. My letter this time looks at the future of work. What I see in my travels is what companies and employees expect from each other has changed. You probably won’t be surprised when I say that my letter includes many of the lessons I’ve learned by listening to all of you and from how we do things at PwC. Based on my client meetings, we have a lot to offer our clients by talking about the experiences we’re having at PwC every day. By sharing our insights we build our brand and we create opportunities to listen for the things that are important to them. I hope you find this helpful! Tim Ryan Here is my letter: The Future of Work As the year comes to a close, I want to share something I’ve been thinking about recently related to the future of work and how we as CEOs can inspire our employees as the nature of work continues to be disrupted. As always, I hope you find my insights useful. The Future of Work and the Changing Employer-Employee Relationship The debate about the future of work has largely focused on jobs -- what they will look like, the decline of good paying jobs for lower skilled workers, and how jobs will be impacted by AI and automation. However, there is a bigger conversation that is worth having: It’s about the changing relationship between employer and employee -- a relationship that is drastically different from what it was 30 years ago and one that must evolve to better match the shifting demands of today’s workforce and employer. From the 1950s to 1980s, the relationship between employers and employees provided workers job security and financial stability with generous benefits. It was a ticket to the middle class. In exchange, workers pledged their loyalty to one company, often spending their entire careers there. Employees were given the opportunity to move up, earning greater pay and securing their families’ futures and their own retirements. But this approach has become outdated for the type of economy and workforce we have today: Technology has created a new class of worker -- one who can work in an increasingly “on demand” way and often on their own terms. It’s also now much easier for people to change jobs with online recruiting tools, and likewise easier for employers to use these same tools to recruit replacements and find new talent. And while workplace flexibility may seem like a great improvement for some, it also has the potential to disrupt work-life balance. Taken all together, Americans’ attitudes toward work and the organizations they work for have changed. A 2017 Gallup survey of US workers found that employees were mainly indifferent about their jobs with only a third of people who were surveyed saying they felt engaged at work. Employers and employees don’t need each other in the same way we used to, which has inspired a fluid, opt-in attitude toward work for many, and less employer investment in the employee experience and benefits. While the relationship between employers and employees has changed, the things we fundamentally need from each other have largely stayed the same. Each side wants stability and security: Employers still want the stability and security of a consistent, productive workforce with the right set of skills; and employees want the stability and security of steady, liveable wages and a great place to work, where they feel comfortable to be their authentic selves and aspire to do and be more. Although our needs haven’t changed, the ways we meet them have. As business leaders, perhaps we should take the first step in re-focusing on a relationship that is not only mutually beneficial, but more importantly one that can once again inspire loyalty and trust in each other. The future of work will require a new set of tenets that meet the needs of today’s workforce. Here are a few thoughts I’ve had on things we can bring to the table: Purpose-driven, meaningful work that links employees’ jobs to larger societal issues and reminds them that their day-to-day activity is contributing to important progress in the world. Multidimensional growth opportunities that are not just linear and allow people to explore different skill sets and passion-points within the same company (in effect, employees should have opportunities to “have different careers” within the same organization). Benefits that accurately meet the demands of people today such as higher costs of child and elder care, chronic health issues, challenges to mental and emotional well-being, the crushing expense of student loans, etc. These benefits should also be modular to allow employees to choose what is most important to them and tailor them to their needs. Inspired leadership that is a living example of empathy for workers. Corporate leaders should foster a culture of mentorship and sponsorship, and an environment where every employee feels ‘looked out for’ regardless of background. This also includes a diverse C-suite that lives the values of the business and are visible, accessible leaders, and not just figureheads. An environment that embraces diversity and inclusion, and that is a safe place for people to be their authentic selves at work. Work-life integration is so common now that we can’t compartmentalize in the way we used to when work was a purely 9-to-5 gig. We each need to be able to talk about our lives and experiences and be met with empathy. This is something that I have thought about a lot relative to PwC. In fact, many of the recommendations that I’ve outlined are central to the employee initiatives that we’ve put into action. These include: digital upskilling for all our employees; emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being programs to help our employees recharge; and opportunities for our people to do purpose-driven work. Together a new employer-employee relationship can expand on what the old one did for decades, create shared prosperity, and hopefully build better and more meaningful work and lives for millions of Americans. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the topic. CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Finally, I would like to thank all of you who are a part of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion. Here are some of our most recent accomplishments and upcoming projects: In just 18 months, we’ve grown from 150 to over 550 CEOs of America’s largest companies. Together, we are working to improve diversity and inclusion in our workplaces. We now have over 450 best practices on our website for anyone to access. In November, we launched the Check Your Blind Spot Mobile Tour where our state-of-the-art bus is traveling around the country educating people on how to recognize and remove unconscious bias in their decision making process. The bus will be going to 100 locations and reaching 1 million people over the next year. We have launched the “I Act On” pledge where workers and students can make their own individual commitment to be more inclusive. Next month, we will once again convene over 200 CHROs and CDOs to create a community for them to share best practices for advancing D&amp;I. On December 7, we held a “Day of Understanding” where over 150 companies hosted discussions on D&amp;I issues and provided unconscious bias training to their employees. We are proud of our impact and welcome any of your organizations who are not part of CEO Action to join us. As always, thank you for your time and I wish you a happy and safe holiday season.

With Access Your PotentialⓇ, we’re taking that commitment to the next generation and making sure they are also equipped with the skills they need to succeed. A team from the Risk Assurance Advanced Risk and Compliance Analytics (ARCA) group in New York Metro took this idea and ran with it. The result: Creative Computing, a cohesive curriculum that teaches students how to code. The program is based in Scratch, a free and easy-to-use programming tool that allows students as young as 8 years old to create their own interactive stories, games and animations. The great thing about Scratch is it’s as easy as putting together Legos -- something we all most likely mastered at an early age. There’s no coding experience necessary, but you will probably learn a thing or two alongside the students. To explore bringing the Creative Computing lessons to a school near you, check out the materials here and contact the Responsible Business Leadership team for more information. Check out other opportunities to teach technology skills through Access Your Potential on Impact Space. Here’s more on how Creative Computing is rolling out across the firm: New York: The team that started it all has spent more than 300 hours in NYC classrooms teaching the 8-week program to hundreds of students in grades 4-7. Now it’s one of the tools in our Access Your Potential toolbox and is already being used in Philadelphia and Boston. This spring we’re rolling Creative Computing out to schools in Chicago and Charlotte as more PwCers get on board in their communities. Philadelphia: In Philadelphia, the ARCA team began teaching Creative Computing to KIPP students last year. The program was so popular that this year the team has had to add a second session, now reaching 40 students with 20 volunteers who rotate teaching duties each week. After the school had to turn away students from the program because they didn’t have enough computers for the sessions, the PwC Charitable Foundation stepped in with a grant. The school was able to purchase new equipment and give more KIPP Philadelphia students access to programs like these.

The CEO Action Check Your Blind Spots unconscious bias tour made a very visible stop at the 2019 NBA All-Star Weekend. Hundreds of fans visited, along with former NBA and WNBA players, PwC people, and clients. The event also created opportunities to raise awareness of unconscious bias well beyond those who visited the mobile tour. Southeast Market Managing Partner Crawford Pounds and NBA Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Oris Stuart spoke to the media about unconscious bias and CEO Action’s goal of bringing this message to 100 cities and 1 million people through this mobile tour. Click here for the two and a half minute television segment -- it’s worth watching! Giannis Antetokounmpo may have thrown down the dunk of the night, but hundreds of visitors to the Blind Spots mobile tour made their voices heard by taking the “I Act On” pledge -- which is something we can each do and share with our clients and teams, too. The "I Act On" pledge, led by CEO Action for Diversity &amp; InclusionTM, encourages individuals to pledge to check their unconscious biases, speak up for others and show up for all. We can commit to making a difference on diversity and inclusion and inspire others to join us by taking the pledge. Just some of the ways we can take action and learn more include listening to the Outsmarting Human Minds podcast, getting involved in our Inclusion Networks within PwC and continuing to have open conversations with others around us. Whether we’re talking to our clients or our friends, we can also share with pride what our firm is doing as a leader with CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion to drive real change in society.

Our firm is strong -- we’re tracking toward our goals, we’re running the business well and we’re seeing One Firm come to life. (Read Tim's message for details.) Those excellent results mean we can invest in you -- through Digital Upskilling, a Be well bonus, enhancements to our family benefits and, if we meet our goals, a larger bonus pool. Thank you for the important role you’ve played in helping to drive our strategy. And let’s not forget, the May 15 deadline for the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge is right around the corner. Check out the tips below to help us all get a week-long July 4th break! Let’s keep the momentum going and finish the year strong with a focus on these three areas: One Firm As you saw in Tim’s update, we’re ahead of our goal for xLoS delivery -- bringing more than one line of service to our non-audit clients -- and that’s a great indicator that One Firm is taking hold. Many of you have been involved in efforts to make this happen, including work on the platforms -- thank you! Regardless of your role, you can make a difference by approaching all of your work with a One Firm mindset. Help us break down silos by connecting with other teams to develop creative solutions to problems. You’ll grow both your knowledge and your network while delivering real value. Continuous Improvement Across IFS, we’re enhancing our processes and technologies to increase efficiency while making things simpler and easier for our people. But we can’t do it without your help. Continue to share your ideas with your coach or leader -- whether it’s a way to streamline a process or provide better services to our clients or people. Your Tomorrow Today’s the last day to self nominate to be a Digital Accelerator. Don’t miss your chance to apply to join this cutting-edge team who will drive innovation at PwC! Self nominations will be accepted until midnight PT. More details here. Let’s pull together to get a week-long July 4th break through the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge -- only one month left! Here are the steps you can take now to help us meet that goal: Digital Fitness: Complete the Digital Fitness assessment, then take at least two of the learnings with quizzes in your recommended feed. Each learning asset is designed to increase your Digital IQ and takes 10-20 minutes, on average. The quizzes are short -- just four questions each.

If you havent yet, complete the Energy Audit and visit the Habit Bank (you can do both of these in under five minutes). And even if you didn’t register for a team challenge, you can still join a team plan, and it will count toward the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off goal. These steps will help you become -- and sustain -- your best self, both personally and professionally.

That’s important -- and so is our absolute commitment to independence. As we tell our story in proposals, to clients or on social media, we must avoid the appearance that PwC may be promoting or endorsing any service, tool or product from an entity, except when we have an established joint business relationship with that entity. This is especially important because some of our vendors are also audit clients and are subject to independence restrictions. Generally, it’s best not to mention our clients, vendors or specific products or services by name. Here are some examples of what you should and shouldn’t do: In a proposal or client demonstration Do: “We’re excited to use cutting-edge visualizations to bring you more insights.” Don’t: “We’re excited to use Tableau [or other product name] to bring you more insights.” On social media Do: “Excited to be attending a PwC Digital Academy where I will learn cutting-edge skills in storytelling, data analysis, #visualization and #automation! #PwCIsGo” Don’t: “Excited to be attending a PwC Digital Academy where I will learn how to use Tableau, Alteryx and UiPath! #PwCIsGo” When you have questions Do: Ask questions and get assistance from the One Firm Risk Organization. Don’t: Go it alone. Protecting the PwC brand Our reputation for independence has been essential to our brand for 160+ years. Here are more quick tips on sharing our story while protecting our brand, relationships and, most importantly, independence: On an engagement or in a PwC solution, don’t specifically name the product or service being used. Instead, cite the nature of the product or service in a generic manner (e.g., “We will use a data analytics tool to prepare an analysis of state-by-state sales tax expenses.”). When performing demonstrations or training for restricted entities, do not use client-specific data, processes or systems, unless part of a formal engagement. Never post images on any public sites (including Tableau) of data visualizations or other content that contains PwC or client data Never mention client names, discuss matters of public policy, or share proprietary information or data that PwC would not want a competitor to know. Click here for more on important independence considerations. US Public Communications Policy Before you confirm your ability to speak, post on social media, or participate in a public forum or industry conference, refer to our US Public Communications Policy. You’ll find clear guidance on who, what, when and how to share our story.

I personally learned so much.” “The sessions left me with some great tools and techniques to grow as a leader, both in and out of the firm.” “The experience, especially the closing session, was completely inspirational!” The three-day, immersive event served this year as a highlight for the completely reimagined IFS milestone program. Expanded to include not just newly promoted managers, but also senior managers, directors and managing directors, the interactive program was designed to strategically nurture IFS professionals’ growth and development throughout their first year in a new leadership role, and beyond. The reimagined sessions at Limitless had at their core some common themes: Taking leadership to the next level, executing on our One Firm strategy with excellence, a focus on becoming infinite learners -- and making lasting relationships along the way. Digital upskilling opportunities were at every turn as participants got to try innovative techniques like rapid prototyping and design thinking and experimented with immersive simulation games. Throughout the event, IFS leaders offered encouragement with a clear message: IFS professionals drive tremendous value for PwC and are a critical part of driving the firm’s strategy.

Beginning today, we’re kicking off a series highlighting these success stories that we’re calling “Lab notes.” We hope their stories inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Neither Justin Hopton or Scott Grossnickle joined PwC with tech backgrounds. But today, as Tax Digital Accelerators, they’re helping their teams and clients use digital tools to work smarter, create efficiencies and drive more powerful results for clients. Their motivation to elevate their digital IQ was sparked even before they became Digital Accelerators -- because they recognized problems, wanted to remove hours and pushed themselves to figure out how to address challenges in an innovative way. “Without having any prior knowledge on Tableau, I just dove right in and figured out how to create a visualization for a client,” said Justin. Learning the tool and building new skills helped him provide clients with added value and increased his visibility with more senior members of the team on the engagement within the first six months. Before long, Justin and Scott were teaching others how to adopt new technologies -- running training sessions and consulting with engagement teams who were looking to transform the way they work. Visualizing data with Tableau This internal consulting work led them to create one of the first visualizations they submitted to Digital Lab. Using Tableau, they captured the work and hours they put into their projects and the impact they made throughout the year -- all depicted with a powerful visualization. How did they do it? First, they got the work in progress (WIP) report and worked with their team to create WIP Analysis Visualization for Internal/PD Codes. This tool converts a raw WIP into Tableau format. It strips away excess formatting, fills out required fields, standardizes date formats and then cleanses the data to format properly for a Tableau visualization. The visualization enabled Scott and Justin to tell their story more effectively. “We were able to demonstrate how we spent our time, the efficiencies we created and how we cut hours out of the process,” said Scott. As a result, they were able to have more meaningful conversations with team members. Justin and Scott continue to drive change, contribute their automations and spread their passion for innovation. They encourage others to be open to the possibilities that come from using these self-service tools with Digital Lab -- and be a part of this technology-sharing revolution. Visit Digital Lab today, start consuming assets, contributing to what you have already created and thinking about new solutions you want to see. To learn more, sign up for a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion session (more information here) on Vantage today, and digitally upskill yourself through resources available on Digital Hub.

Letting your network know how you are transforming your work, and PwC, with your new digital skills and capabilities is a great way to tell our digital story -- and showcase our brand. You can find our full social media policy here. Please remember to keep these things in mind before you hit the “share” button: As a general rule, we don’t mention our clients or vendors by name in social media posts. In order to avoid perceptions that PwC may be promoting or endorsing any one company, tool or product over another, keep your posts general without naming a particular brand.

Never share proprietary information or data that PwC would not want a competitor to know, mention client names or discuss matters of public policy. Many vendors (including Tableau and Alteryx) are also audit clients and are subject to independence restrictions. PwC must remain independent of SEC audit clients in accordance with SEC independence rules in both fact and appearance, including perceived joint business relationships. As such, PwC cannot, among other things, promote or endorse an SEC audit client’s software or influence a client's purchase of a license. Read the Business Relationships Independence guidance for information about permitted activities when interacting with SEC-restricted software providers. Remember to use the #PwCIsGo hashtag for all your Digital Upskilling posts! (When posting and tagging #PwCIsGo, always remember that you’re representing the firm.)

I love the “routine” that this program offers my otherwise chaotic schedule. I feel like I'm making progress and learning HOW to deal with my back pain. I changed my diet, walk more (in addition to running), and have lost some weight, which helps a lot with the back pain.

New expense guidance Traveling to a 'high-dollar' city? New expense guidance US Finance Nov. 9, 2018 “How do I know if I’m traveling to a ‘high-dollar’ city?” When we streamlined our travel and expense policy last year, one of the things you asked for was clear and consistent guidance on reasonable spending. Our new expense system helps us stick to our policy’s daily limits* for out-of-town, individual travel meals ($100 USD per day in high-dollar locations; $75 USD per day in all other locations). *Note: Our daily limits are not per diems; they are guidelines for an appropriate outer limit for your actual daily meal expenses. We follow IRS guidelines for high-dollar cities -- a list that’s updated each year. Find the full list under Hot Topics on our Finance page, and see below for the cities added and removed this year (effective Oct. 1, 2018). New IRS high-cost locations: Sedona, AZ Rockport, ME Los Angeles, CA Duluth, MN San Diego, CA Pecos, TX Vero Beach, FL Moab, UT Jekyll Island / Brunswick, GA Cody, WY No longer IRS high-cost locations: Mill Valley / San Rafael / Novato, CA(removed) Leland, MI (removed) Steamboat Springs, CO (removed) Saratoga Springs / Schenectady, NY(removed) Petoskey, MI (removed) More to know Ready for more pro tips?

While I hope none of you has to face difficult or uncomfortable situations here at PwC, I also know that we’re working in a complex environment and no organization is perfect. That’s why I want to remind you that if it does happen, it’s important to speak up. If you’re concerned about a client matter, firm policy or a situation that makes you uncomfortable -- please talk to your coach, partner leader, Relationship Partner, the One Firm Risk Organization or the People Team (HR). You can also report your concerns to the Ethics HelpLine, anonymously if you prefer. Whether you have a concern about questionable time reporting (“eating time”), suspected misuse of client or PwC data, antitrust law questions, possible sexual harassment or another matter, the firm is here to help with the right policies and resources. Your concerns will be taken seriously and handled confidentially. Many of us have completed the Pressures &amp; Demands course -- and it’s now required for all of our people via My Compliance Dashboard. The training is important and the message is simple: We are a firm where the expectation is that everyone treats each other with respect -- and when we see a situation that isn’t right, we speak up. Tim Ryan Understanding what’s expected To refresh your memory on the firm's expectations that we report our concerns, take a look at PwC’s Code of Conduct and the Reporting Concerns policy in Our Standards. And if you haven’t completed your Pressures &amp; Demands training, make sure you take the course, available on My Compliance Dashboard now.

The once very active, happy-go-lucky IT manager in Tampa faced the most difficult obstacle of her life. The disease began to redefine her physical abilities, but Valerie found the inner strength to cope -- and thanks to support from her PwC team and the firm’s flexibility, she was able to surpass even her wildest dreams. “Confronted with a sudden and mysterious disability, I worried about my economic future and ability to meet my responsibilities,” Valerie said. “What also weighed heavily on my mind was the fear I’d never cartwheel again. My older brother and hero taught me how to cartwheel when we were kids. The prospect of never being able to do the one thing that reminded me of him was scary.” With tremendous support from family, friends and the entire firm, Valerie was able to continue working, traveling -- and cartwheeling. But her path hasn’t been easy. At times, the simple act of standing up became almost impossible. “Myasthenia Gravis gradually made my life more difficult,” she explained. “It prevents my muscles from receiving the message my nerves are sending. So a single motion can take the energy of a hundred.” Major surgery in 2013 helped alleviate some of her physical ailments, but Valerie also credits the firm for helping her get through the tough times mentally and emotionally. “I don’t know what I would’ve done if the firm wasn’t so helpful,” she said. “When my mobility became limited, I was allowed to work from home. Mentally, I was in a battle to prove that I was still capable of being me and, in large part thanks to the firm, I won. During my weakest moments, my team provided support, never complaining about my situation or making me feel ‘less than.’ They always considered me for opportunities, even allowing me to take on a global role with sometimes heavy travel requirements.” Valerie hopes her story will inspire others who find themselves in similar life-altering predicaments. Her advice is to always have a goal to draw your focus beyond your immediate circumstances, and to recognize that you’re not alone. “People experience challenges all the time, and if they can persevere, so can you,” she said. “Regardless of your situation, it could always be worse. So appreciate each day and make the most of what you have.” Like a perfectly executed cartwheel, at one point Valerie found her life upside down. But it was only temporary. Today, Valerie is in remission and happily continues to cartwheel when she travels. Next up are Northern Ireland, Iceland and Denmark. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: Keep flexibility on the agenda for team conversations, even during busy times. You don’t get it if you don’t plan for it. Hold one another accountable to make flexibility happen. Create a plan and execute on it throughout the year. Our Flexibility2 Spark site provides tips and best practices you can leverage. Valerie credits her PwC family for being able to cartwheel on every continent.

What is Start? Start is PwC’s summer diversity internship experience. It’s designed for high-performing rising college sophomores and juniors who self-identify as members of traditionally underrepresented minority groups in the professional services industry, protected veterans and/or individuals with disabilities. It allows these students to learn more about our firm while further developing the skills to help them succeed in the business world. Who can apply to be an ILA? Client service experienced senior associates or managers from Advisory, Assurance and Tax are welcome to self-nominate. ILA responsibilities and expectations: Commit 20 hours, from June 10 to July 26, to serve as the main point of contact for a group of four to five Start interns. You will be partnered with another ILA and your time will be protected in TalentLink. Work with the group’s Relationship Leader(s) to identify a four-day shadow experience for your interns (leveraging your Deployment Consultant as needed). Oversee interns during a summer-long Skills for Society project where they analyze data to help a nonprofit solve real-life challenges and present their findings. Act as the “Engagement Manager” for the project and coach your interns on how to create a deck and deliver a presentation (coaching can be done in person or virtually using WebEx or Google Meet). Mentor interns by sharing your PwC experience and answer their questions throughout the internship. You will also assist Recruiting in converting certain interns to a client service internship. Complete Snapshots for the group’s shadowing and project work and be part of their Intern Round Table. What’s in it for you? Build your One Firm network. ILAs may have the opportunity to team with an ILA from another LoS and a Relationship Leader to co-lead your four interns. Help build the firm’s diversity pipeline in a meaningful way, foster our culture of belonging and further develop your own skills as an inclusive leader and coach. Receive a Snapshot from the Relationship Leader (director or partner) with the potential for a differentiator for a job well done. How to self nominate to be an ILA: Fill out this form and submit your application by May 3. If selected, a member of the Start National Planning team will reach out to you with next steps. You will also be provided ILA training prior to the internship start date. If you have questions about the program, please email us at pwc.start.internship@us.pwc.com.

You’ll find this upgraded version more responsive when working with large files and more efficient when running programs concurrently. The rollout will be by line of service. When it’s time to install the upgrade, you’ll see a pop-up. Installation will take about 45 minutes, during which you can continue to use your PC (you don’t even have to reboot). However, you won’t be able to use Office apps. Next time you open an Office app, you’ll see a one-time login screen. Simple enough, right? But wait — don’t create an account. All you need to do is log in using your @pwc.com email address. (If you enter another address, the login will fail; follow these instructions to try again). Select Sign in, and you’ll be taken to the Activate Office screen below. Enter your @pwc.com email and select Next. That’s it! Microsoft Office menus and file locations remain the same — your apps will simply work more efficiently. Apps are installed locally on your PC, and future software updates will come directly from Microsoft. If you have questions, please see this guidance or visit PwC’s Service Hub for assistance.

It impacts the way we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. That’s why PwC is committed to providing mental health support services for all of our people. In FY19, we’ve enhanced our support services to help those struggling with mental health issues. And as part of Be well, work well, we’ve added resources to help our people manage everyday challenges. These benefits include: Six free mental health visits Our LiveWell Resources program (access code: pwc) includes six free mental health visits per person/issue each medical plan year (July 1-June 30). These visits are in addition to the mental health coverage provided by the PwC medical plan.

Correcting misconceptions To alleviate the stigma about mental health and create a culture where our people feel comfortable and feel a sense of belonging, it’s important to learn the facts. And remember, if you or someone you know is experiencing a crisis, we have resources that can help. Here are some common myths and facts on mental illness: Myth Fact There is no hope for people with mental illnesses. There are more treatments, strategies and community support systems than ever before, with even more on the horizon, thanks to research and therapeutic advances. People with mental illnesses lead active, productive lives. At PwC, we offer several mental health benefits that our people can access at anytime. I cannot do anything for a colleague with mental health needs. You can do a lot, starting with the way you act and how you speak. Nurture a culture that builds on people's strengths and promotes good mental health. For example: Avoid labeling people by their diagnosis. Learn the facts about mental health and share them with others, especially if you hear something that is untrue. Treat everyone with respect and dignity. Mental illnesses are brought on by a weakness of character. Research has shown that mental illnesses are a product of the interaction of biological, psychological and social factors. Influences, such as loss of a loved one or a job can also contribute to the development of various disorders. People with mental health needs, even those who have received effective treatment and have recovered, tend to be unproductive. Employers who have hired people with mental illnesses report good attendance and punctuality, as well as motivation, quality of work, and job tenure on par with or greater than other employers. Studies show no differences in productivity when people with mental illnesses are compared to other employees. Resources to help you with your mental well-being Managing triggers.

Read on for our favorite moments, and don’t forget to watch the replay to see what else people are talking about. This is a big year for Your Tomorrow. Tim shared the key messages from our recent Fall Partner meetings, the progress we’ve made delivering as One Firm and driving Continuous Improvement, and most significantly this year, how Citizen-led and Business-led innovation will drive our Your Tomorrow strategy. View the Your Tomorrow overview that Tim shared here. What really happens at fall partner meetings? We got the inside scoop. Tim shared the key strategy messages our partners heard and played a time-lapse video of the meetings., He also announced that we’d all get a flavor of what fall partner meetings are all about through our Strategy in Action video series, which highlights various topics showcased in booths at this year’s meetings. Watch the first three of our Strategy in Action videos here. Our Digital Upskilling journey is in full swing. Digital Talent Leader Sarah McEneaney was joined on stage by Robin Stein, Taniesha Robinson, Lindsey Luraschi and Caleb Hester, who each shared their Digital Upskilling stories. From pausing meetings at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesdays and Fridays to play PowerUp!, to becoming an in-demand Alteryx superstar in your office, there are many ways our panelists are leveling up their digital acumen -- and it’s easier than you might think. Those skills will be critical in completing the four Digital Quests that will earn them -- and all of us -- a Digital Acumen knowledge badge by the end of FY19 (June 30, 2019). Want to increase your own digital acumen? Start your journey by accessing our Digital Upskilling resources on the Digital Hubtoday! It pays to PowerUp! Our PowerUp! hostess-with-the-mostess Christine made a guest appearance to kick off the broadcast, then returned for a bonus team prize presentation for those teams that played PowerUp consistently throughout the six week challenge and had the highest average scores. While not everyone could take home the big prize, we did all get something pretty great: We found out that we’ll continue to play PowerUp! two times a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays at 2 p.m. ET! (And don't forget to check out the pre-reads on the Digital Hub. Note tomorrow's are under November 6.) You can add future games to your calendar with this link, and congratulations again to our winning teams: PowerUp Girls, Mind the GAAP, Kjar's Champs, Walk With Elias, Ron's team and the ASMT DA team. We’ve got so much to look forward to before the New Year! With the launch of Digital Quests, Digital Lab and continuing our Be well, work well efforts through 50,000 Random Acts of Kindness, we’re heading into the last half of the fiscal year with a lot to be excited about. The first Digital Quest will launch next week -- Sarah challenged each of us to complete it before 2018 comes to a close. And you can use all the skills you learn to get the most of Digital Lab when it launches Nov. 13 (to get a preview of the experience, watch the Digital Lab video Robin shared here).

Start a Chain Reaction. Advisory - test May 6, 2019 Optimizing supply chains to meet modern customer demands takes more than selecting technology and functional excellence. It requires transformation and integration across enterprise operations. PwC's Connected Supply Chain Integrated Solution helps our clients design and implement a digital, intelligent, fully transparent, end-to end and interconnected supply chain that optimizes for speed, risk and profit. See how by visiting our newly launched website. What is the Connected Supply Chain Integrated Solution? Companies are leveraging significant advances in automation, machine learning, robotics, AI, and other digital capabilities to deliver on the promise of an agile supply chain, often in ways that were unthinkable only a few years ago. External triggers that previously were considered impossible to plan for can now be anticipated and addressed in real time. For example an unexpected demand spike after a celebrity endorsement, a snowstorm that disrupts the inflow of parts from suppliers, or an expected heat wave that could lead to an increase in demand for sports drinks. The connected supply chain can monitor social networks, weather forecasts, and numerous other data sources and automatically optimize the supply chain. With the onslaught of emerging technologies and sharp increases in expectations of consumers, customers and employees, deciding where to invest is becoming ever more difficult, and more pressing. Our solution helps clients navigate through the complexity and take advantage of digitization to help build a truly “Connected Supply Chain” that is Fit for Growth and ready to meet the needs of the connected digital age. We help clients transform through an agile approach that enables them to make small improvements that can be built upon to maximize for the future -- becoming smarter, more agile and adaptive. By leveraging our integrated, technology-enabled solution, which relies on our strong alliance partner collaboration model, our clients can envision how they can transform their supply chain into an intelligent, digital ecosystem. PwC has proprietary technology to accelerate project delivery and drive deeper insights. Supply Chain Opportunity and Optimization Platform (SCOOP) is PwC’s supply chain analytics platform which provides rapid insight into supply chain performance by diagnosing performance issues and opportunities. Using advanced analytics – including machine learning, simulation and optimization – it accelerates how our clients can access and build capability in advanced supply chain analytics.

Anything as a Service (XaaS) Integrated Solution for the win! Advisory - test Feb. 20, 2019 Client problem Thoma Bravo, a leading private equity firm with over $30 billion under management, is on a mission to acquire and transform software companies on an accelerated pace. Portfolio software companies typically get goals of transitioning to subscription/software-as-a service (SaaS) business models, and increasing business velocity while optimizing operating costs and investments in enabling technologies. One of these companies, Qlik—a provider of data management and analytics platform services— faced declining sales productivity along with mounting market pressure to launch its subscription/SaaS business, and had aborted a previous effort due to business readiness challenges. PwC was brought in to provide an actionable approach to quickly break the Q2C operations logjam and enable Qlik’s rapid transition from on-premises to SaaS. Qlik jumped onboard when we showed them an actionable path toward SaaS. We created a Magic Moment... Qlik’s leadership knew they had to move to a subscription/SaaS business model, but there were too many legacy processes, ambiguous sales and customer engagement along with the burden of historical technology investments. PwC’s Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) Integrated Solutionprovided leading practices to help Qlik imagine the “art of the possible.” We showed them that to function at “cloud speed,” they needed to update certain processes so they can move faster and with fewer bottlenecks. We captured their issues on a visual heat map and quickly developed hypotheses for the necessary operational initiatives. We worked with Qlik to prioritize key initiatives and develop 30-, 60-, and 90-day action plans for people, processes, and technology. Qlik was thrilled with how quickly we were able to put together practical, real-world action plans and so was Thoma Bravo. Before the SaaS transformation was complete, Thoma Bravo engaged PwC in an XaaS transformation for Apttus—another one of their portfolio companies. We delighted Thoma Bravo by accelerating Qlik’s transformation in a mere 14 weeks. The solution and value we brought It seemed impossible at first, but we understood that a speedy transformation would set the stage for a successful launch of the new sales experience. We leveraged our XaaS integrated solution IP to run a hypotheses-based engagement focusing on target state design and accelerated implementation. Two key initiatives were prioritized based on projected business impact - Segmented Transaction Flows (1-touch/ high-touch) and Strategic Deals Desk. This cleared the path for the sales team to configure, price, and quote their own orders (1-touch transactions) by developing clear thresholds and guidelines for straight-through/auto approval of quotes. These policies for auto-approval were based on streamlining and simplifying order elements like: offerings available pricing and discounting thresholds length of contract terms billing frequency It used to take days to create and approve quotes. Now, within four weeks of their subscription/SaaS solution going live, Qlik has transformed this to where over 80 percent of quotes are created in under 10 minutes, and more than 85 percent of quotes have been approved automatically, speeding up the process even more. This was achieved by working with Qlik’s leadership team to develop the ideal customer and sales experience leveraging XaaS process and capability frameworks along with industry leading practices, and aligning on minimum viable operations by BXT together with leadership. "This transformation will drive more sales growth, dramatically lower the cost of transactions and improve the morale of the organization. I look at my “1-touch” transaction dashboard every day, and it’s already showing me how well this transformation has been going. This program is a success."

I’m humbled by the thoughtful notes I receive with perspectives on all sides of the issues happening around us. From time to time, I’m going to share some of these thoughts -- not necessarily with names and details -- but to share ideas to help us understand and be good colleagues to each other. A couple of weeks ago one of our Muslim colleagues wrote to me reflecting on the shooting in New Zealand and the month of Ramadan. From May 5 to June 4, some of our people may be fasting from dawn to sunset in observance of Ramadan. This is an opportunity for us to get to know each other in another way and be respectful of our colleagues. Also, as a reminder for all, most of our offices have Serenity Rooms that provide private space for reflection, prayer, meditation, or respite. These rooms are available to us for these uses -- on this holiday or others. While I’m honored to hear from so many of you, I know I can’t address every event or day that is significant to some of us. What I hope is that we’ll continue to get better at talking about what’s important for each of us. Having these conversations one-on-one or in our teams lets others know how they can support you and how you can support them in return.

The goal was to identify key words and phrases to help group and service similar reported incidents, and provide valuable insights and visualizations on these submissions to identify potential areas for improvement. Before moving forward with a vendor, they asked John Heinen, senior manager in IFS, to use his skills as a Digital Accelerator and data scientist to assess a report that one vendor was able to produce prior to engaging the third party. “Because of the training I received in the Data Analytics track of the Digital Accelerator program, I knew I could make a better report,” said John. In only three days — after leveraging Jupyter notebooks on NLP in Digital Lab and using his newly acquired Tableau skills — John developed a visualization that not only surpassed the vendor’s, he also helped the firm avoid spending $427,000 by using PwC resources in Digital Lab to build, host and run the report instead of using a lower-quality third party solution. After his report was selected, John explored the capabilities of Workbench in Digital Lab to share his visualizations with others. “The capabilities of Workbench are amazing,” he said. “You can easily generate a URL to a very polished and professional-looking visualization from a report in Tableau or Power BI and send it to someone with no access or prior knowledge of those technologies and they can understand it.” In addition to helping our finance team, work is already underway to scale John’s report to other areas of our business that use PwC’s Service Hub as a support function, starting first with our IT and payroll teams. And John is thrilled with the results. “This experience is what I dreamt about when I joined liftoff in October,” he said. “I’ve been with the firm for almost 20 years and right now is truly an unprecedented time to be at PwC. The Digital Accelerator program has been a life-changing experience — it’s what we all need to stay successful.” In addition to being one half of PwC’s only husband and wife Digital Accelerator duo — his wife Amanda Heinen, senior manager in IFS, attended liftoff in July — John was also recently profiled in a Huffington Post blog from Shannon Schuyler, Chief Purpose Officer, entitled “This Is What Happens When You Find Meaning In Your Work.” Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Karen Pasawicz, Scott Hamrick, John Heinen Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/36291.html</url><pwc_title>Lab notes: Ordering team meals stressing you out?

Digital Lab has a bo Lab notes: Ordering team meals stressing you out? Digital Lab has a bot for that HQ News Jan. 7, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. This “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope their stories inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. We’ve all been there -- a looming deadline, a late night, stomachs rumbling and the debate over which restaurant to order from seems endless. After team suggestions, Tax Senior Associate and Digital Accelerator Jordan Sandona set out to eliminate the stress of organizing a group dinner order. She created her first bot and shared it through Digital Lab -- and it’s now saving time for teams across the firm. (Note: See our travel and expense reimbursement policies for details on meal expenses.) We talked to Jordan to learn more about her team's Dinner Bot. The original users of the Dinner Bot (left to right): Jordan Sandona, Becky Mayo, Ellie Rauch, Eric McAuliffe, Bill Callan, Brittany Ruth, Jason Krentz, and Rachael Oxton PwC Inside: How did the team come up with the idea for the Dinner Bot? Jordan: It was actually my practice bot for UiPath training. I was working with a Core Tax provisions group in Milwaukee as a Digital Accelerator, asking them about their pain points and where time could be saved. The team made a joke about ordering dinner and it stuck with me. It can take an associate an hour every night to talk to the team, choose a restaurant and place an order. Even though it isn’t client-related, technology can help save time on this administrative task, giving back time for client-billable work. With the bot, you build a list of potential restaurants in your area that the bot will then randomly select from in seconds, making the painful process more like a game. Overall, it was a great experience to learn and get upskilled. And now, I am upskilled on the technology when the opportunity comes up to create bots to help out clients. What has the feedback been? When I first created the bot and the client team started using it, colleagues in my office talked about it, so I was encouraged to upload it to Digital Lab. Since then, people from every market have told me they will use it! I appreciate it so much, since we really didn’t expect a response. It was just my practice bot for an administrative task, but it addresses a universal pain point and gives teams time back. Were there challenges to getting the bot working? Since this was my first time using UiPath, I had an initial upskilling challenge. I did a lot of searching on my own. Then, when it was uploaded to Digital Lab, with so many more people using it, it wouldn’t work with bot runner. But through the user feedback and help on the site, including ideas from Digital Lab reviewer Spencer Miner, we’ve fixed the issues and introduced new improvements, so it’s even smoother to run. Have you submitted anything else to Digital Lab? I’ve been part of two client-related automation submissions. The first is a team project to help review Schedule K-1 tax forms for partnerships. The bot will save at least 200+ hours -- or half the time it used to take for us to review these for one client -- and should be able to be leveraged for any client. And the latest is a fixed asset report automation. I’ve also found a lot of cool automations that I use frequently. You never know what you are going to find that can help you, so I check out Digital Lab regularly. Do you know how you will use your Digital Lab rewards yet? I’m not sure -- but more than the rewards, I’m happy we can help teams. Choosing a place to order food is the last thing you want to be spending your time on. I hope the bot gives a few minutes back to everyone’s lives, and that it might help get them home a few minutes earlier.

And, for our audit clients, Salesforce helps us manage client relationships. We communicate better across our teams, save time, run our business well and deliver a better One Firm client experience. Tim asked Salesforce users to concentrate on these three actions during Monday’s webcast for Managers, Directors and MDs (which he’s also shared with partners), to help us get even more out of Salesforce. Chatter more. Use Chatter to collaborate more quickly on pursuits and refer to messages in a central location. @Mentioning key team members, particularly on xTerritory pursuits, keeps everyone aligned and reduces the need for internal emails and calls. Include contacts on your opportunities. Providing visibility around who is buying services enhances our understanding of our clients’ issues and strengthens relationships. Log your meetings to facilitate discussion. Keep the data current. Moving your opportunities through the pursuit stages in a timely manner leads to greater transparency for the account, as well as for our leadership teams -- helping them more effectively identify opportunities they can help at the appropriate times. New enhancements are coming with the next Salesforce release on Monday, May 6, including the ability to save Chatter posts as drafts. See more below. Release outage Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, May 3, at 8 p.m. ET to Sunday, May 5, at noon ET. Coming Monday: Chatter draft Salesforce heard us -- losing a Chatter post you spent time crafting is a pain! With the May 6 release, you will be able to save your Chatter post as a draft to post later (available via desktop version of Salesforce). Here’s how: Type your Chatter post as usual. You will see Saved appear below the post as the system automatically saves your content. To access your draft at a later time, select the Chatter tab from the top menu and click My Drafts on the left side. From there, click on the down arrow on any draft and select Edit, Publish or Delete. An update on new fields Client Data Use Provision: We’ve seen tremendous success with securing the client data use provision in client contracts and are now using Salesforce to capture our progress. For every non-audit opportunity won, complete the new US Client Data Use Contract Provision field on the Opportunity details page in Salesforce. This Quick Reference Card has instructions. We communicated how to capture the status for our recurring annual audit engagements and other assurance engagements to our Core Assurance and PCS Assurance partners last week. Additionally, in the May 6 release, you’ll see the first steps for two updates in Salesforce that will be put into practice later this summer. No action is required; stay tuned for next steps: Director Allocated Bookings: For FY20, each line of service will provide guidance and messaging for a new feature that allows Allocated Bookings to be awarded at the director level on certain wins (subject to our independence rules). AFS integration: New fields will appear on Opportunities and Clients related to AFS status, although actual integration with AFS will not be enabled until later this summer. Have feedback to share?

One way we do this is by pairing each new joiner with an onboarding ambassador — a go-to person to help them learn the ins and outs of PwC. Want to be the go-to person for a new joiner? Apply to become an onboarding ambassador! We’re always looking for ambassadors for our experienced hires, and as we get ready to welcome entry level hires this summer and fall, we’re looking for even more of our people to join our ranks and apply. Corey Chin (left, new joiner) and Meaghan Hand (right, ambassador) try to connect in person whenever they’re in the office. Onboarding ambassadors connect with their new joiners before their first day to welcome them to the firm, answer any initial questions and let them know they’ll be in touch to set up a lunch date after their first day. After that, they have regular touch points over the new joiner’s first six months. The onboarding ambassador time commitment is generally a total of three to five hours over the new joiner’s first six months. Watch this video for more information about the ambassador/new joiner relationship. The program is designed to connect new joiners with their teams and offices right away Whenever possible, ambassadors are matched with new joiners in their line of service, city and staff level to help maximize connectivity. Onboarding ambassadors share their experiences: Meaghan Hand, Tax: The onboarding ambassador program is great for anyone interested in breaking into mentoring. My new joiner has appreciated the monthly check points and uses me as a resource for general questions he has about PwC. Even during busy times, if we can’t meet in person, he knows I’m still here. Karen Quarles, IFS: I enjoy helping new joiners navigate the firm and sharing tips and tricks to help them feel confident as they start at PwC. Serving as an onboarding ambassador touches most, if not all, of PwC’s core values. Honoring these values is something I’m truly proud of. Tom Van Oosterom, Advisory: Whether a new joiner is just starting out in their career or has years of experience, they’re all new to PwC. Their questions definitely evolve the longer they’re with PwC — they usually start with asking about things like what courses are mandatory and signing up for benefits, and then we move on to talking about Snapshots and tools like TalentLink. Andrea Vorlicek, Assurance: I really enjoy being an onboarding ambassador. It’s a great way to meet new people outside of those you work with every day. Most of the questions my new joiners ask are questions I remember having when I started at PwC: dress code, Snapshots, requesting vacation, etc. Having a dedicated person to ask these questions of, knowing there will be no judgement, is really important. For more information, check out these ambassador resources. Then, apply to make a difference to new joiners as they start their PwC careers!

I'm Tim Redding, Director and US/Mexico Security leader, based out of the Seattle office. I've been with the firm for 24 years. What’s a typical day for you? Each day revolves around helping our people and their families whenever there are concerns for their safety. I oversee our crisis teams, who hold regular safety risk assessments and emergency drills in our offices so we can stay ahead of disruptive events. We also run business continuity tests to make sure we can still serve our clients and run our business properly during an emergency. Collaborating with a wide range of PwC teams helps us expand our ability to identify risks and threats. How did your journey lead you to this role? After college graduation my passion turned to travel, and one of the first places I visited was Hawaii. I noticed a booming economy, and, on a whim, applied for a few jobs, including one at PwC. The firm hired me and I moved to Honolulu, just like that! I handled everything from IT tech support to finance and operations -- a great way to “learn the firm.” I later left PwC for an opportunity in Dallas, where I ran IT operations at a regional level. Always looking to learn and grow, the next stop on my journey was attending Harvard University to pursue a master’s degree. But, guess what? They asked me to help out in their IT department, which was supposed to be a part-time job while I earned my degree. But it soon morphed into a full-time job protecting against network hackers and cyber criminals. Everything came full circle when I was recruited back to the firm in my current role blending my love of security and IT. How does your team bring value to PwC? We’re here when you need us most. That’s the simplest way I know how to put it. We care about the safety of our people, 24 hours a day, wherever they are across the world. By putting the PwC core value of “care” in action -- whether on US soil or abroad -- we can assist in any kind of emergency. Providing comfort in challenging times is the lifeblood of our team, whether through safety measures, counseling, financial support, legal assistance and more. Being on the front lines and providing safe harbor for our people in times of need is the most rewarding part of our job. We’re a one-stop shop for safety; we live and breathe it. What might we be surprised to learn about you? I’m a competitive downhill skier -- and I can sometimes win in my age group! Through sports I learned about teamwork and staying calm under pressure, which also helps me do my job effectively when navigating our people through an emergency. My uncle was a great role model; he was a US Air Force pilot and taught me how to fly a plane. I typically just observed him, but one day he handed me the controls and told me to fly the plane myself. I had no choice but to stay calm -- and I did it!

After recognizing the potential of this bot to save an immense amount of hours across the firm, the Tax Automation CoE and the PwC Labs team partnered together to further automate and improve the bot, and to increase its scale to include both federal and state tax extension forms (including forms 1065, 1120, 1120S, and more). Next, the team introduced the bots to the Global Delivery Model (GDM) team to further centralize the process and build our expertise across our support network. Kristen Sauvigne, director in Tax, oversaw the workstreams as the project lead and has seen the success of these bots firsthand. “One State and Local Tax (SALT) engagement prepares more than 300 extension forms during a one-week period in the month of February,” said Kristen. “They were able to leverage the extension bots this year and save 50 percent of the time they had budgeted for the work. They reduced their hours on extensions from 100 down to 50, just by leveraging these automation tools!” In addition to the SALT team, there are many more teams who have saved time with these bots, including, an Asset and Wealth Management (AWM) engagement team that reduced their time spent on extensions by 80 percent, moving from 25 hours down to 5 for their 55 extensions, and another AWM team cut out 30 hours from processing their 75 extensions. A Banking, Capital Markets and Insurance (BCMI) engagement team also reduced their time by 72 percent by spending only 54 hours — down from 194 — on their 145 tax extensions. Following the busy season in Tax, the Tax Automation CoE and the PwC Labs team has plans to continue to improve these bots. To date, the success of the tax extension bots has been astounding: 33,380 runs in Digital Lab 1,409 unique users across 14 different markets/geographies 70 percent of users are from GDM More than 180 jurisdictions/forms supported through the bots Check out these time-saving tax extension bots now in Digital Lab: GoSystem Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Attended (Desktop): A desktop bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in GoSystems GoSystem Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Unattended (Server): A server bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in GoSystems OneSource Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Attended (Desktop): A desktop bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in OneSource OneSource Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Unattended (Server): A server bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in OneSource Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Tax Automation CoE Workstream leads: Scott Stein (Partner/MD sponsor), Kristen Sauvigne (project lead), Shiv Kuncham, Elizabeth Robles, Christopher Wein, Stacey Chen Automation core team: Danny Park, Matthew Buckles, Scott Holland, Nathaniel White, Nitya Vashishtha, Bailee Kwilinski, Duy Nyugen PwC Labs: Brett Kelley, Jay Krames, Chris Bigley and the Digital Lab team Tax GDM: Wendy Martin and 30+ Tax GDM extension champions AWM SALT: Paulina Keating Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40601.html</url><pwc_title>Spread summer joy with Real-time recognition </pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-10 03:27:46</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>newsType:Firmwide</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title>Spread some summer joy with Real-time recognition </pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>Give a deserving colleague’s (and your own) emotional energy a boost with Real-time recognition.

Chief Digital Officer Joe Atkinson and Digital Talent Leader Sarah McEneaney welcomed the Digital Accelerators to the space-themed two-and-a-half-day immersive experience, and shared PwC’s vision for our Digital Accelerators and upskilling PwC as a whole. With their out-of-office messages set to things like “I’m in orbit” and “busy building rockets,” the Digital Accelerators spent their time gaining important skills in areas including Design Thinking, Agile, creative problem-solving, storytelling, networking and preparing for their new roles. The enthusiasm that carried through the entire event from opening to closing was overwhelming. Learning and Development Leader Katrina Salem summed it up well: “This might have been the first time we ever had a standing ovation at the end of an L&amp;D program!” Futurist Jacob Morgan who hosts the Future of Work podcast, sat down with Sarah for a conversation that included inspiring insights into his work as a futurist and wrote about the Liftoff session on LinkedIn, "This is actually one of the best approaches I've seen any company take to future proof their employees." Here are just a few highlights of Liftoff (knowing that we don’t want to give away too much before our upcoming sessions in August, October and January)! These Digital Accelerators are ready for liftoff! Sarah McEneaney and Jacob Morgan before their sit-down conversation. Drone and virtual reality demonstrations Tim Ryan shared a virtual message, thanking the Digital Accelerators for raising their hands to join the program and letting them know the firm is counting on them as agents of digital change. Everyone had fun posing with our favorite astronauts! You can see from this word cloud that our Digital Accelerators were inspired and empowered by their Liftoff experiences. “PwC is go” and we have liftoff -- and a mic drop: Sarah McEneaney led a fitting countdown to conclude the Liftoff mission. This first group of Digital Accelerators will now take what they learned at Liftoff and, depending on their lines of service/IFS, continue their learning while applying their new knowledge into their assignments on the ground. Three more Liftoff sessions are planned for August, October and January, during which the rest of our first class will be welcomed aboard. Interested in becoming a Digital Accelerator? The next call for self nominations for Digital Accelerators will happen later in FY19. In the meantime, there are many things we all can do now to build our digital skills. For instance, we can continue on our journey to Digital Fitness through the Digital Fitness app and accessing the digital assets in Vantage (while you’re there, sign up for daily tech updates from MIT Tech Review!). And we’ll soon launch a variety of easily consumable Digital Fitness learning assets, delivered in unexpected ways, with the goal of bringing everyone in the firm to the Digital Fitness level by September 2019. We’ll start the launch of this exciting cascade with our “Tech While You Trek” podcast series, within the soon-to-launch PwC Podcast app later this summer. You can find the latest podcasts now by searching “Tech While You Trek” on Vantage.

What you need to know about US economic sanct Working internationally? What you need to know about US economic sanctions Ethics &amp; Compliance Oct. 18, 2018 US economic sanctions continue to dominate the news headlines, particularly with the recent expansion of sanctions on Russia and Venezuela. These sanctions may impact our work related to non-US entities -- and could restrict services, primarily in the financial and energy sectors. Economic sanctions are very complex and change regularly. Cuba, Crimea (region of Ukraine), Darfur (region of Sudan), Iran, North Korea and Syria remain subject to comprehensive US sanctions. Check this guidance and up-to-date listing of both embargoed and higher-risk countries. If you have any concerns, consult. A breach of US sanctions rules, even if inadvertent, can have serious consequences for you and the firm, potentially resulting in civil and criminal penalties. Consultations with Government E&amp;C and Risk Management are required before engaging in any transaction, directly or indirectly, involving an embargoed country or a country that presents a higher sanctions risk. Please make sure you review our PwC US Sanctions Policy to understand your compliance and reporting responsibilities.

Your first point of contact will coordinate with other OFRO consultants to bring in the right subject matter specialists to address your issue, so you won’t need to navigate across multiple risk management and independence contacts. (For audit quality or execution matters, please continue to consult with Assurance Quality Management through the National Quality Office.) You can continue to reach out to your legacy Risk Management contact for guidance in the near-term. However, we encourage you to start using the OFRO resources available to you, such as connecting with subject matter specialists through our OFRO portal (see below). That specialist will guide your request through a full range of support across the OFRO ecosystem. Tech-enabled tools to simplify your life We’re also tech-enabling our processes to make things easier and more efficient for everyone -- through tools like: Rapid Engage (for automating/tracking client acceptance and engagement startup) Create (to automate engagement letters and contracting) DocuSign (e-signature platform), and Our new OFRO portal with a wealth of risk-related resources and a robust search function.

Note, the engagement letter submitted for signature should incorporate any changes made by the AFS Scope-of-Services Review team. For these tax services, a minimum of two approvals is required: 1. the Primary Approver (the Responsible Partner for your client, as listed in CES) that is auto populated by the AFS system (usually the audit partner or the GRP), AND 2. the “AFS SoSRteam” (GUID = AFS001), which you must manually add as a Contact and check the “Approver” box, in order for the AFS Scope-of-Services Review team to be notified. Additional reminders include: · Add a draft of your engagement letter in an editable Word version. · Be sure to read and complete the questionnaire you receive from the AFS Scope-of-Services Review team after your AFS is submitted. · Don't put "ASAP" as your required deadline. Explain your Client specific deadline within the request so that the review team can prioritize appropriately. Understand the Independence rules that apply – review them before you complete your review request. · Ensure the engagement letter clearly describes the proposed services and the delineation between PwC’s role and the role of the Client. · Identify the Client oversight contact and explain how you know this person is both capable and willing to oversee the project. Watch the video “5 Tips to create better AFS requests” for additional simple ways to make the second-level review process go more smoothly.

We’re sunsetting Lotus Notes email in phases -- and the next step on this simplification journey is deleting our old email archives. We’ve got good news: This step is pretty painless! Through the end of FY19, everyone will still have access to your most recent three to four years of Lotus Notes emails. You really won’t notice much of an impact when the older email archives are gone, particularly if you joined PwC within the last four years and you’ve been using Google Mail as your primary email system. What to expect On Jan. 15, we’ll delete all but the most recent Lotus Notes email archives from your PC*. You’ll get a popup notification before it happens -- and up to three opportunities to defer. *Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold, or part of an exception group. Read more on what that means and check to see if a Legal Hold applies to you. Your most recent email archive will stay in place, for now. So will your current Lotus Notes mailbox -- giving you access to your most recent three to four years of emails. But wait! I’ve got important stuff in Lotus Notes! We understand it can be hard to let go. So we’ve got a number of tools and resources to help you find, move and appropriately store any information in Lotus Notes that continues to hold business value. Whether you’re still a heavy user of Lotus Notes or you just have a few old emails you want to save, we’ve got everything you need on our Data Remediation page. Next steps toward Lotus Notes sunsetting Deleting our old email archives is the first step -- but we know you’re ready to move completely away from managing two email systems! Here’s what you can expect as we keep moving forward: By the end of FY19, we’ll put in place a new 18-month retention period on our current Lotus Notes mailboxes. (In plain English, this means we’ll start automatically deleting Lotus Notes emails when they hit the 18-months-old milestone.) Also next year, we’ll start a similar retention period for our Google Mail, calendar events, Google Drive, Google Keep, Sites and G+ content. (We'll give you plenty of warning, but you can start to prepare now by refreshing yourself on our systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration.) Later next year, we’ll be ready to delete everyone’s last Lotus Notes email archive and stop issuing new joiners Lotus Notes profiles altogether. More to know The way we approach data as a firm is changing. As part of a multi-year data journey, we’ve implemented robust, modern systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration. At the same time, we’re retiring outdated data storage systems; deleting redundant, obsolete and trivial data; and implementing best-in-class guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle.

Workday makes it easy to refer candidates and apply for ne Got talent? Workday makes it easy to refer candidates and apply for new roles People Team Sept. 24, 2018 The launch of Workday in August brought some exciting changes to our people experience, such as connecting to development teams, upward and peer feedback and the ability to self-manage personal information. Workday is also the place where you can refer experienced external candidates and apply for internal roles. Talent knows talent: Refer qualified individuals from your network Do you know someone who has the right qualifications for a position at PwC? Some of our best candidates come from referrals by our people. In fact, we’ve found that candidate referrals stay with the firm longer. Referring experienced candidates is easy in Workday. Simply type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to get started and find a job that suits your referral. Our new process gives you greater visibility into your recommended candidate -- you can easily check the status of submitted referrals at any time (type ”My Referrals” in the Workday search bar). An added incentive? If you refer a candidate who is hired, you may be eligible for a referral award. Please note: Only experienced referrals should be submitted through Workday. Refer to the Employee Referral Program site for guidance regarding entry-level referrals. To receive a referral award, you must submit experienced referrals to a posted open role through Workday before your referral applies for the role.Immediately after you submit the experienced referral, an automated email will go to the referred candidate directing them to apply through a specific link. The referred candidate must use that link to apply for the job in order to be tagged as a referral. If they do not, you will not receive credit as the referring employee. For appropriate credit and status updates, referred candidates cannot be accepted through Google email or any other means except the Workday referral application link (effective today). Referred candidates will not be visible to recruiters until the candidate has applied for the job. For more information, take a moment to review the Employee Referral Program quick reference card (QRC) and policy. Make sure you follow the guidance above so you don’t miss out on a referral bonus! If you have questions about submitting referrals, please contact the Employee Referral Team. Grow in your career with PwC: Applying for internal roles and tours As we grow and evolve in our jobs at PwC, the time may come when a new role more closely aligns with our qualifications and career aspirations. With Workday, all you need to do is type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to explore and apply for an internal role. Please note: All applications for internal roles and tours must be made through Workday and will leverage your TalentLink profile (if you have one). Internal candidates must inform their coach, relationship leader and People team of their application at the time of posting. If selected to be interviewed, it is also the candidate’s responsibility to continue to keep this group updated throughout the process. The new Workday functionality replaces the previous process for applying for tours in Quest. For more information, review the Applying to an Internal Role QRC and policy. If you have questions about applying for internal roles, please reach out to your local People team contact.

Beginning Jan. 1, 2019, you can: Contribute up to $19,000 (up from $18,500 in 2018) on a pre-tax basis to your PwC 401(k) Savings Plan account. Contribute an additional $6,000 pre-tax, if you’ll be age 50 or older by Dec. 31, 2019. (You can make after-tax contributions, too.) Add more to the commuter program; 2019 limits are increasing to $265 per month for transit expenses and $265 per month for parking expenses (up from $260 for each in 2018). 401(k) Savings Plan Are you contributing to the 401(k) Savings Plan? You can increase, decrease or stop your 401(k) contribution amount at any time throughout the year via Benefits Express Online. Here are five reasons you should save as much as you can in the 401(k) Savings Plan. The pre-tax dollars you contribute do not count toward your gross income for the year. This lowers your taxable income -- and your taxes. The firm matches 25% of the first 6% of eligible compensation that you contribute. If you’re saving less than 6%, or you’re not contributing in each pay period throughout the year, you’re losing out on free money because you’re not receiving the maximum firm matching contribution. Your balance can grow over time with investment earnings. PwC offers you the flexibility to select investments based on your personal investment approach. You can use any and all of the offerings across the three investment profile tiers to create your own portfolio. Investment earnings are tax deferred. Because your investment earnings are rolled back into the plan, they don't have to be listed as income on your tax return until you withdraw them. Your savings grow faster this way. You can take your vested account balance with you if you change jobs, and roll it over to another qualified plan or IRA. Doing this simple procedure will keep your savings tax-deferred. (You’re always vested in your own contributions. You vest in the firm’s contributions over a period of five years based on a graded vesting schedule.) Learn while you earn Well-Being Rewards points Watch the 401(k) Savings Plan video and Investing Overview video from your desktop for more details about the plan and your investment options.

The National Commuter Benefits Program If you take public transportation to work or pay for parking, the Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax earnings each pay period in a WageWorks account to pay for work-related transit and/or parking expenses. In fact, using pre-tax dollars for expenses you’re already paying for can save you up to 30% of your commuting costs -- you save on federal taxes, state taxes (in most states) and FICA.

Give a little thanks today! Boost a colleague’s emotional well-being. Give a little thanks today! People Team July 9, 2018 We’ll soon launch a new tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool. During the cutover period (July and August), you may still recognize others for a job well done. Did you know that showing gratitude fuels our emotional energy? It aligns with Be well, work well, a vital component of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Remember how you felt the last time someone told you what a great job you were doing? Recognition makes people feel really good about themselves and motivates them to keep up the good work. Positive reinforcement sets an example for everyone in our organization, at any level, showing them the kind of work you value most. Here are some ways to recognize others during our transition: Write a personal thank-you note for someone’s contributions or download this editable card, fill it out and attach to an email. At your next team meeting, offer a gratitude jar or board where team members can share kind comments about each other or say “thank you” to a colleague. Make recognition something you do regularly. Add it as an agenda item in a team meeting or write a thank-you note every day. Once recognition becomes a habit, you won’t have to think twice to do it. What you need to know during this transition: Monetary awards: If you received monetary recognition in FY18 and have yet to redeem for gift cards, you will need to redeem them by August 31. Please note: You'll need to click on the link found in your Real-time recognition reward email(s) to redeem. Questions: Contact Hallmark. Uninstall the app: The current Real-time recognition app in PwC's App Store will be disabled. If you downloaded the app, uninstall it from your device. Stay tuned for the launch of our new tech-enabled recognition tool in early September. Curious as to what’s coming? Watch this short video. And watch this site for updates.

PwC’s 2018 Global Blockchain Survey includes insights from 600 executives from 15 territories, with 84% saying their organization has at least some involvement with blockchain technology. Companies have dabbled in the lab; perhaps they’ve built proofs of concept. Everyone is talking about blockchain, and no one wants to be left behind. It’s easy to see why. As a distributed, tamperproof ledger, a well-designed blockchain doesn’t just cut out intermediaries, reduce costs and increase speed and reach. It also offers greater transparency and traceability for many business processes. Gartner forecasts that blockchain will generate an annual business value of more than US $3 trillion by 2030. It’s possible to imagine that 10-20% of global economic infrastructure will be running on blockchain-based systems by that same year. Bloomberg, CNBC, Forbes and Fortune are just some of the major media outlets that have written about the report; and, of course, we’ve received prominent coverage around our Blockchain Validation Solution, a services and software solution that provides governance teams, including internal audit, risk management, legal and compliance, with the transparency and continuous assurance to move blockchain projects from pilot to production. If you haven’t already, start the blockchain conversation with your client today. Our new report outlines four strategies for clients navigating this new world: Make the blockchain business case. Identify the business value. Strategic clarity will ensure that your blockchain initiative has a business purpose around which you and other participants can align. Build an industry ecosystem. Consider the benefits of collaboration. Blockchain may call for competitors to collaborate in a new way, as they come together to solve industry-wide problems. Design deliberately. Explore potential blockchain models. Every blockchain will require rules and standards, particularly around what various participants will be able to access and how they can engage. Navigate regulatory uncertainty. Understand the shifting regulatory landscape. You’ll need to stay agile to meet regulatory requirements as they evolve in the years to come.

So what compelled him to select the picturesque island as his vacation destination? “Iceland’s soccer team had recently been covered extensively by sports journalists and it caught my interest,” Ryan explained. The country captured the hearts and minds of soccer fans by becoming the smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup. While the team was never expected to win the tournament, they distinguished themselves in a different way with their “Viking clap”: players and fans in unison clapping their hands above their heads while crying out “Huh” to the beat of a drum. The chant quickly became a fan favorite. “I had also heard the island is known known for over 20 hours of daylight daily and offered endless adventures,” Ryan said. “So I booked it.” Racking up rewards points Ryan’s trip happened to coincide with the launch of our digitally enabled Well-Being Rewards Program through Virgin Pulse. He was able to rack up a ton of Well-Being Reward points, given the amount of hiking and sightseeing Iceland had to offer. “During my short four-day tour, I logged more than 82,000 steps all while experiencing breathtaking waterfalls and warm natural spring waters from the island’s famous geysers,” he said. To accumulate more points, Ryan perused the Virgin Pulse app on long car rides around the island. He browsed healthy recipes on Zipongo, tracked his daily habits, and listened to Whil mindfulness sessions to further decompress on his vacation. “Having access to the Whil program is a great benefit,” Ryan said. “I learned so much about emotional intelligence and new techniques to manage stress.” Ryan is grateful to work for a firm that encourages mindfulness and an active lifestyle. Not only did he return from Iceland feeling refreshed and able to be his best self, but he had enough Well-Being Rewards points to earn? a gift card. Not everyone will have the chance travel to Iceland, but hopefully Ryan’s story inspires you to be well, live better and earn Well-Being Rewards!

This was the first time we tried something like that as a firm, and it was a powerful and memorable day -- but it was only the beginning. What came next was not something I was planning or expecting. But when talking to many people inside the firm, the question we kept hearing was, “What’s next? How can we do more?” We looked at what we could do inside PwC, and we made our blind spots unconscious bias training part of the path to promotion. Because we started talking to each other about race, we’ve also been able to talk about gender equity and respect in the workplace, as these issues became part of our national conversation. Inspired by all of you, we’ve also taken the conversation on diversity and inclusion beyond the walls of PwC. That day two years ago provided the spark that became the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™ -- and we became leaders in helping the business community take action, learn from each other, and make progress on these very important issues. Our purpose means we are called to take on important issues that matter to our people, to our clients and to society. The steps we’ve taken over the last two years are a perfect example of what it means to be a firm with a purpose and an inclusive culture, where all of our people feel included and a sense of belonging. And once again it’s time to ask, “What’s next?” We started with a conversation, and this is something we can continue to do every day. Taking the time to ask about others’ experiences and to listen is something we can do anytime. One of the next steps we took was to share training and resources to help all of us grow our awareness and understanding of these issues. This includes blind spots training that’s open to everyone at PwC and Outsmarting Human Minds to help us think through everyday decisions. Take time to explore these resources and talk about them with your colleagues. With CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion, we’ve created a platform to connect with others and drive change. As we often talk about internally -- scale is powerful. We have a goal of reaching 1,000 companies, knowing that the more like-minded organizations that come together, the greater our reach, and the more change we can drive. You don’t have to be talking to the CEO to share the resources of the CEO Action website -- which is open to all. It’s a great starting point for opening up a discussion with the people in your network. Team, it’s been my privilege to have the opportunity to talk with many of you over the last couple of years and to represent our firm in the business community. What inspires me each day is how much people both inside and outside the firm care about making progress on these issues and want to be part of the solution. And that makes me optimistic that we can continue to become even more inclusive as a firm and a society.

Here are answers to four questions we know you have on your mind: Where do we stand with the bonus pool? We’ve accomplished a lot this year, from the thousands of hours taken out of our client engagements and projects through our citizen-led efforts under Your Tomorrow, to the steps we’ve taken to continuously streamline and simplify the way we work and deliver as One Firm. Because we’re focused on the right things and our business is growing, we’re in the position to increase our bonus pool with an uplift similar to last year. The increased bonus pool is a reflection of all we have to be proud of this year, and allows us to recognize the impact of our collective efforts. This does not mean that individual bonuses will be higher — it simply means our overall pool has increased and your leaders will have additional dollars to allocate beyond our baseline targets. As a reminder, when the firm does well, the partners increase the bonus pool and during years where financial targets are not met, the overall pool could be reduced. How do I see the bonus ranges? Bonus targets for staff are available in the Me@PwC app. Download the app from PwC’s App Store to see all your total rewards on the go. How are bonuses determined? Consistent with prior years, relationship leaders finalize bonus decisions during Career Roundtable discussions based on each person’s performance and impact. When will I find out the results of the Career Roundtable discussions? A lot of care goes into this process — and you’ll hear the results between June 17-28 when Career Outlook conversations take place. Look for a calendar invite from your Relationship Leader (or reach out to set it up).

Over the past two years, this Advisory team has called North Carolina their home during the work week. With last year's natural disasters, like Hurricane Florence, affecting North Carolina residents, and specifically some our client partners and their customers, the team felt it was important to leverage their size to make a difference. Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina (SHFBM) strives through education, advocacy, and partnerships to eliminate hunger by the solicitation and distribution of food. Shout out to this group for making a difference packing and repacking all the bread! To plan a volunteer event for your team, check out resources on Impact Space.

Entering similar information across multiple systems … confusion about next steps … and uncertainty about the timing of code release. The process can be frustrating and time-consuming. Good news -- your life is about to get simpler and easier, with Rapid Engage. What is Rapid Engage? Rapid Engage is designed to help you get from opportunity identification to WBS code release faster. Think of those “pizza trackers” that allow customers to watch their pizza status as it moves from order, to oven, and out for delivery. Rapid Engage is designed with that transparency -- and ease of use -- in mind. The tool overlays our existing client and engagement acceptance systems (including A&amp;C, AFS, engagement contracts, myEngage and others), providing one interface that helps you complete required process steps and track your progress. Once released to your team, Rapid Engage will be available from your desktop and mobile device. Rapid Engage is launching in a phased approach across the firm during the month of August, beginning today. Your line of service will share launch details with your team over the next few weeks with instructions on how to access the system. (The initial release of Rapid Engage will be deployed in the US only. Mexico will have access later this year.) In the meantime, watch the preview video below to see a sneak peek of Rapid Engage in action. How does it work? Rapid Engage doesn’t change our existing client acceptance policies and procedures -- it just makes the entire process easier for you. Once an opportunity moves beyond the “Target” stage in Salesforce, it automatically displays on the Rapid Engage landing page, for all opportunity team members listed in Salesforce. Clicking on an individual opportunity takes you to the “Client Details” tab, where all required client and engagement acceptance steps are outlined based on the client type, restriction status, and proposed service. Once the client acceptance and engagement details steps have been completed, Rapid Engage goes into action, triggering the remaining engagement acceptance steps for you. The tool auto-initiates forms and pre-populates some required fields based on the information you’ve already provided, and continues to guide you all the way through code set up and release. Rapid Engage provides clear instructions on next steps and sends real-time notifications about required information that’s missing, so you always stay on track. You can check status anytime on your desktop or through the mobile app. What do I need to do once my team gets access? Get to know Rapid Engage. Stay tuned for launch announcements throughout August from your line of service. When Rapid Engage launches to your team, you’ll receive a Quick Reference Guide and detailed FAQs on the tool and how it interacts with the underlying systems. PwC Help (877-792-4357, option 1, option 3) is also standing by to offer assistance. Make sure opportunity information in Salesforce is complete and accurate. From the date of release to your team, Rapid Engage will pull new US opportunities entered into Salesforce as soon as those opportunities move beyond the “Target” stage in Salesforce. The old adage remains true: “Garbage in, garbage out.” If the underlying data in Salesforce isn’t comprehensive and accurate, you won’t get the full benefit from the new tool. Watch for tracker-initiated alerts and respond to them in a timely and accurate fashion. This will reduce unnecessary back-and-forth, and help avoid delays. Spread the word! Encourage your colleagues to use Rapid Engage when it rolls out to them. As more of us take advantage of this new tool, we have the opportunity to make significant efficiencies real, and continually improve the user experience.

Just ask the small ARCA team from the midwest who came up with the idea for our Halo for MLA Scoping tool. What was once a simple visualization dashboard for an internal audit client has grown into an Assurance-wide web-based application available for use by more than 1,000 engagement teams. Here’s how. Innovation doesn’t necessarily need to be complicated to be successful. But there are two important aspects it does require: a great idea and a support system to arm you with the right tools and resources. So when ARCA team (Director Jen Couser, Managers Jamin Kee, Aaron Mayer and Sebtastin Englert) raised the idea of building out a new dashboard to make it easier for audit teams to create the Multilocation Audit Scoping Documentation Template - Appendix B, ASM&amp;T team (Partner Mary Grace Davenport, Managing Director Staci Wheeler and Director Devan Bailey) helped make it happen. After a couple of short months, the team was able to create a prototype and share it with several engagement teams, who immediately saw its benefits -- a more efficient work process and an enhanced ability to evaluate scoping decisions. After a short demonstration, ASM&amp;T realized the potential of this tool to continue to enhance quality and value while also addressing a pain point. As a result, they leveraged relationships within the network to sponsor the design and build the end product with the specialist development skills of the Global Assurance Tools &amp; Technology team (thanks to Managing Director J.R. Williams, Director Lori Morris and Senior Manager Carolyn Mourey). This is an excellent example of how taking the time to evaluate and question the impact of a specific process or tool can lead to an innovative idea. So, the next time you’re frustrated by a process, take a minute to stop and think about how you might be able to enhance it. Because the next big idea could start with you!

In addition to following the specific risk management protocols for these types of engagements, engagement teams should be sure to include adequate documentation of our work, advice given, assumptions, and our client’s involvement in the engagement files, on a contemporaneous basis (see Documentation policy). It is preferable for tax engagement teams to obtain a timely representation letter from a client in connection with a tax accounting service engagement. The representation letter is intended to memorialize the respective roles and responsibilities of PwC and management, as well as reaffirm management’s responsibility for decisions, judgments and review over the course of the engagement. A template of the Representation Letter can be found in the C2 Tax Accounting Services toolkit along with a comprehensive list of helpful tools and templates. Our documentation in DMS, either through the use of a representation letter or otherwise, should include contemporaneous evidence that the client took responsibility for decisions and judgments and was involved in the review of our work and deliverables. When transmitting deliverables for tax accounting service engagements, the tax engagement team should ensure the deliverables are only transmitted to the client. If any third party file-sharing websites such as SharePoint, Box or Dropbox are used to transmit deliverables, US IT approval is required, even if the client is one of the file-sharing sites. To request an exception for a file-sharing website, email Security-Exception-Request@pwc.com, (see: https://pwc-spark.com/docs/DOC-729687). Learn more For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that there is separate guidance for engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients. Need help?

The Deals mid-year review and outlook reveal that the number of deals north of $5 billion in 2018 is on pace to double last year’s total, and to date has driven overall deal value up by more than 50%. Transactions are also getting bigger, with more announced deals of at least $30 billion so far in 2018 than in all of 2017. As US economic growth remains steady, that momentum should continue and will likely accelerate as lingering questions around tax policy and big vertical deals have largely been answered. The current M&amp;A cycle has been quite uneven, and the pattern will likely continue in the months ahead. Share the full Deals mid-year report and outlook with your clients, and in the meantime review the five things shaping the current deals market: Money to spend: Since the start of 2018, one-third of megadeals crossed sector lines, driven largely by an appetite for new technologies. Capital cushion: US corporations and investors continue to hold on to cash and keep valuations elevated. High oil prices: The growing demand for goods and services may be a sign that the pace of economic growth is nowhere close to slowing down. US tax reform: Execs are re-evaluating growth strategies, including how much to commit toward M&amp;A versus buybacks or increased dividends. Antitrust ruling: A surge of megadeals could hit the market now that AT&amp;T’s plans to buy Time Warner have been cleared. Deals is one of our PwC platforms designed to help us address the issues most important to our non-audit clients.

We've held many difficult conversations across our firm since Bo Jean was killed. We've raised over a half million dollars to commemorate Bo through scholarships in his name. At the same time, we also have more to do inside PwC. I wanted to share what we’re working on next and you’ll be hearing more from me in the next few weeks. We’re asking the 500+ signatories of the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion to join us in a day of dialogue on race and differences, at each of our respective companies, on Friday December 7. Our firm will take a leadership role, sharing resources and offering the help of PwC people, at no cost, to assist other organizations in holding these discussions. Together, we’ll create opportunities across the business community to talk more openly about the experiences of our diverse colleagues and help all of our professionals understand what their co-workers and friends experience. I encourage you to talk to your clients about this effort -- working with your partner and team so we share a coordinated message and help them get involved. I also want to thank everyone who participated in the discussions inside the firm over the last few weeks -- and you’ll hear more about the day of dialogue and how we will participate as we get closer to December 7. As many of you know, earlier in the summer, we launched the CEO Action’s Check Your Blind Spots mobile tour. We originally planned the tour to visit workplaces and universities with training to help people recognize, acknowledge, and minimize potential blind spots. Now we’re expanding the tour to include a third and very important component: We’ll work with mayors and city councils to bring unconscious bias training to local communities. Our goal for these actions is simple. As a purpose-led firm, we want to remember Bo and make our world a little better by taking on the difficult issues around race and differences that are troubling so many of us. By helping people inside and outside PwC better understand unconscious bias, we can be part of the solution.

Just like updates to apps or a phone, these continuous improvements to Salesforce functionality and capability reflect your feedback and the latest technology. Here’s what’s new and improved in the Nov. 5 release: PwC branding and new homepage design The new and improved homepage features new widgets for Notifications, My Dashboard and News. New Insights tab added to Opportunity pages A new Insights tab on Opportunity pages makes it easy to view Similar Opportunities, Resources and Recommended Actions to help your pursuit. Each of these fields is dynamically populated, based on what you’ve entered in the Opportunity, and will serve up unique information for each Opportunity. Quick-Create and Required-Field Opportunity updates The Quick-Create Opportunity button now appears on Contact pages. Starting an opportunity from a Contact page will automatically add your Contact to the new opportunity. The Required-Field Opportunities button now allows you to enter all Opportunity information in a few quick steps! The new functionality saves you time -- you can now add Team Members, Client Contacts and Product Codes in one easy process. Relationship Management made easier When you synchronize a Contact from Introhive, Salesforce will automatically create a relationship between you and the Contact. A Priority Contact checkbox field has been added to the Contact page -- this allows you to identify strategically important Contacts and track them in Contact Reports and Contact List Views. The Relationship Strength field has been moved to the Relationships section of the Contacts page where each PwC user’s “Relate Me” relationship can be assigned a strength. This update makes it easier for you to view the unique details of each PwC relationship at the account level. New Marketing Activity tab added to Contact and Lead pages Activities run by our marketing team related to a Lead or Contact are now viewable on the new Marketing Activity tab. This tab showcases client contact email clickthroughs, form submissions, and event/webcast registration and attendance. Good to know As part of the Nov. 5 release, a key enhancement will impact the product-related fields and the “behind the scenes” data model. While beneficial in the long run, this improvement to our data model may require you to update your in-app reports or dashboards. To understand the benefits of this move and the reporting impacts, check out this Salesforce Learning &amp; Support Chatter post. Release outage Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, Nov. 2, at 8 p.m. ET to Sunday, Nov. 4, at 2 p.m. ET. Questions? Need help? We’ve got you covered!

Tempting as it may be, the “miscellaneous” expense category should be used only in rare cases -- and often triggers getting your expense report reviewed and either sent for additional approvals or returned for updates. So what’s the solution? Pro tips: Choose the right expense type Our new expense system gives you options for just about any expense type you might need. Before you choose “miscellaneous” -- and potentially put a flag on your report -- check to see if there’s a category you might have missed. Here are some that are often overlooked: In-flight Wifi*: When you’re working in flight, this is your code. Review our policy for expensing wifi, and make sure you categorize it as such. Tips and gratuities: Left a cash tip for hotel housekeeping? This expense type is usually out-of-pocket -- and should stick to a reasonable and customary amount. Training and seminars: If you’re headed to an approved seminar or conference, make sure you choose this expense type. Professional dues and subscriptions: There are two categories to choose from: CPA Related Dues/Subscriptions and Professional Subscriptions/Dues. Travel Documents: Use this expense type for things like getting your visa to travel abroad for work. Looking for an expense type for your latest IT accessory? You are in the wrong place! All IT accessories and peripherals must go through IT Orders. Using your PwC AmEx card for those purchases will raise a flag on your report. *Corporate Finance -- please continue to expense in-flight wifi to the client or G&amp;A code you are using on your expense report. More to know Before you start expensing, watch the Introduction to SAP Concur Expense, available in Vantage. We’ve tackled the most common scenarios to walk you through the step-by-step process in our new system. Refresh yourself on our new travel and expense policies, which went into effect Jan. 1. The new expense system puts compliance up front, so avoid surprises by making sure you’re clear on what’s in -- and out -- of policy. Ready for more pro tips?

You may need to update your BSP account Changes in your personal life? You may need to update your BSP account Ethics &amp; Compliance Oct. 18, 2018 Maintaining your securities in the firm’s Brokerage Simplification Program (BSP) is an ongoing responsibility for anyone required to maintain an Independence Checkpoint portfolio -- for you and your family. If you don’t use Independence Checkpoint, this doesn’t apply to you. Stay mindful of events that can affect your independence and require you to manually update BSP account information, including: Changes to your brokerage account, or if you or someone in your immediate family opens a new brokerage account. If your spouse changes jobs, they’ll need to roll over their 401(k) or other employee benefit plan into an IRA or to their new employer’s plan. Getting married or moving in with a significant other (“spouse equivalent”), meaning their brokerage accounts also need to be recorded in Independence Checkpoint. BSP will not automatically account for these types of changes, so you’ll need to record any new accounts and update revised account numbers to maintain your personal independence. Rollovers must be completed within 90 days, and any new accounts or account number changes must be registered in Independence Checkpoint as soon as possible. Our Ethics &amp; Compliance BSP team is here to help. If you have questions visit BSP on Spark or reach out to the Compliance Resource Center (CRC) -- click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option 5.

Three things you need to know -- or do -- right NOW: Get ready...later this spring we will be releasing a new version of Aura -- “Aura Platinum”. Aura Platinum will be fully on-line enabled with many enhancements, including dramatically improved dashboards and metrics, with visibility across all of your engagements and across multiple tools.

If your team needs assistance to improve client site connectivity, fill out this form and an implementation resource will be in contact. Have questions? Visit the Aura Spark page for FAQs. Connect v2.7 will be retired in July 2019. Connect V3 was released last spring and our engagement teams and clients have benefited from the new features and faster performance. If your team hasn’t transitioned to Connect V3, now is the time! And remember to take advantage of the integration with Aura; by linking your requests in Connect to corresponding EGAs, this will allow your team to easily see when EGA progress may be impeded by overdue requests in the new Aura Platinum. Get started using the Connect v3 Transition Guide and other materials available on Spark.

Halo for MLA Scoping facilitates and automates certain manual elements of the step-by-step scoping process, and provides real-time visualization of the impact of your scoping judgments. It also saves time by eliminating the manual creation of the quantitative summary, including Appendix B. Connect Audit Manager, our global collaboration tool, streamlines communications between multi-location audit teams, enabling fast, efficient and secure information sharing with component teams at every stage.

The settlement concerns audit work that was done more than 10 years ago at Colonial Bank. At the time our firm was auditor of the bank where several employees committed fraud. I want to answer a couple of questions that may be on your mind. First, we are a firm with an excellent track record for quality. Quality is a top priority for us — and we’re always learning and looking for even more ways to get better. Second, there’s nothing in the settlement that will change how we are investing in your development experience, making our firm more digital, offering meaningful benefits that meet or exceed industry standards and working together as One Firm to deliver the quality and value our clients expect. Last, if others ask you about the settlement, you might wonder what to say. If you are asked about this by a client, please involve the partner you work with to help respond. If you are approached by the media, please direct them without comment to Beth Parker in our external communications group, and please don’t make any comments on social media. And if others ask, you can tell them we don’t comment on client matters. Team, I know it may be hard to see headlines like this about our firm, but there’s nothing about this settlement that will change how we serve our clients, operate our firm or provide opportunities for all of you.

We have a solution. Our new TAP (Targeted Attack Protection) tool warns you when an email contains malicious web links. PwC rolled out this new technology to protect against threats like phishing and targeted attacks. Here’s how TAP works If a link in an email is safe, you’ll see no difference. Malicious links, however, will trigger a notification like the one below. Is it safe? Email may be malicious even when it looks legitimate to the discerning eye. TAP adds another level of protection -- for you, our clients and our firm. But even with TAP on your side, you should still be on the lookout for suspicious communications, and always report them by using the new phish button in your Google Mail side panel or by forwarding to GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com. Our cyber protection strategy starts with each of us. Example: Have you received one of Google’s proactive phishing protection and management control alerts (see image below)? Please report any of these types of warnings to PwC as mentioned above. More information Contact GBL_NIS-E-Mail-Security-EFD-Communications@pwc.com.

Talent Exchange now offers weekly and daily pricing Advisory - test June 7, 2019 As we discussed last week, new Talent Exchange functionality that will allow you more flexibility in structuring agreements with independent talent is just around the corner. You’ll have the option to offer talent Daily and Weekly rates, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Today, we're spotlighting Daily and Weekly rates. After creating a time-based role, you will have the option to negotiate and extend offers for daily/weekly rates to talent. Take a look at the key benefits and considerations below to learn more! Key Benefits For PwC For Talent Provide better certainty of cost if irregular or extended hours are required to meet delivery needs Can assist in preventing margin erosion Provide consistency of rate Allow flexibility of working hours Key Considerations These new time-based rates will appear on WIPs as hours. (Days are considered to be 8 hours, and weeks 40 hours.) If talent will work across multiple locations in one week for a project, a daily or hourly rate should be used. You will be asked to specify the role payment type during role creation. For time-based roles, the sub-payment type will be limited to "Hourly" during role creation and pricing events. However, you will be able to update and consider daily and weekly rates at the point of offer. Given their work arrangement with MBO Partners, some individuals' talent cards will be marked with "Hourly Projects Only." This means that they can only accept offers for "Hourly" projects. Please do not engage with these talent if you are looking to leverage alternate payment types (e.g., Fixed Price, Daily, Weekly). If you’ve followed along so far, great work!

Take note of these ind On the list for promotion to manager on July 1? Take note of these independence requirements People Team April 23, 2019 Heads up! It’s promotion season. If you’re being considered for promotion to manager, you’ll need to comply with additional independence requirements prior to your promotion effective date of July 1, 2019. Maintaining personal independence is a critical responsibility. We must understand how financial holdings and relationships can impact our clients, the firm and our personal independence. Individuals at the manager level have more independence requirements than senior associates, and you’ll need to have your financial relationships and holdings reviewed for independence before you can be promoted. You’ll have plenty of support, but block time now so you are prepared and can meet all the hard deadlines. Deadline Activity May 31 Complete your Annual Compliance Confirmation (ACC). June 7 Manager Promotion Checklist If you’re a senior associate who was recommended for promotion to manager during Career Roundtable, you’ll be notified on June 3 by your Relationship Leader. You will receive a communication from Hillary Stanley, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, on June 4 and will be required to complete a Manager Promotion Checklist by June 7. You will be asked to provide statements for all brokerage accounts, 401(k)s, and other investments held by you and your spouse/spouse equivalent and dependents. TIP: Start gathering that info now! If you are being considered for promotion, review the New Manager Promotion Clearance site for a detailed timeline of personal independence actions you need to take and resources that are available to assist you. June 13 Complete your LoS promotion requirements, such as Blindspots training, credentialing and other courses June 28 For new managers and above: You should sign a new employment agreement (to be emailed on June 24) by June 28 — prior to the July 4 firmwide shutdown — via Workday for a July 1 promotion effective date. All other staff levels: You will be notified of promotions starting June 3 through June 7. Promotion Day will take place June 21. As you think about your progression to the next level, don't forget to update your TalentLink profile. Keeping your information up to date can help identify opportunities for you that best fit your experience and the skills you'd like to develop. If you have any questions about independence or other promotion requirements, please reach out to the Compliance Resource Center: 1-877-PwC-Help, option 5 (in the US); 1-813-351-6491 (outside the US). All promotions are conditional upon successful compliance of necessary promotion requirements by the appointed deadlines.

Check out this short video to learn how writing personal thank-you cards has fueled her team’s emotional well-being and improved engagement. One of Christine’s personal thank you notes signed by partners. A Boston-based Valuation team created a gratitude wall and encourages colleagues to post at least one sticky-note a week. The wall quickly filled up with various thank-you notes and continues to be a nice reminder of the importance of taking a break and appreciating the people and things that make us happy. These teams found that practicing gratitude reminds them to take a step back from their busy lives to appreciate the people they work with. It puts smiles on faces and has a positive impact on their creativity and productivity. Real-time recognition is coming The wait is almost over. Next month, we will launch our enhanced, tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool. With so many exciting features, it’s never been easier to show appreciation for your colleagues. But don’t wait until the new tool arrives to recognize your colleagues for a job well done. Take these two thank-you note examples or check out these other ideas on how you can recognize others before we launch the new tool. Keep it digital and download this editable card, fill it out and attach it to an email. Note: If you still have recognition dollars to redeem, reference your email with the subject "Real-time recognition award" to access the link and redeem your award by Aug. 31.

They were able to make partner while working a flexible work arrangement (FWA). These formal programs provide predictability and opportunity to help our people bring their whole selves to work, feel valued and a sense of belonging, while being there for their families. We talked with each of them to hear their stories and the lessons they learned. Kristen Conner Kristen began a FWA 15 years ago when returning to work after the birth of her first child. Since then her family has grown, and she has become a partner of the firm. In her own words ... “My story is one of growing your career your own way -- it’s been a unique journey that has been built around the firm providing a non-typical career path for someone who needed exactly that. “An FWA allowed me to have the best of both worlds in pursuing a professional career that keeps me challenged, but also allows me to be actively involved in the lives of my two daughters. The ability to pursue greatness in both roles has been a tremendous blessing. The flexible work arrangement and other programs the firm offers are an invaluable benefit to parents that would be hard to find anywhere else. I could not have achieved all that I have done in my career and as a mother without such programs. “The key is creating an arrangement that is balanced and works for both the firm and you. For example, I maintain additional flexibility for my clients and teams during the busy periods when my clients are more likely to need me. You learn how to make the most out of every minute spent during the working hours for your clients and teams and every moment spent with your family.” Kristy Romo Kristy started a flexible work schedule in 2012 when she made managing director. In this role she could continue her passion for client work while being there for her family. In her own words ... “In my time on an FWA, some years I could take on more and other years I’ve taken a step back. The partners have been a huge support for me as I made my journey from senior manager to managing director and now to partner. They always provided me opportunities to continue to learn and grow. If anything, the FWA has allowed me to stay at the firm and to continue to contribute. “The most important lesson I learned on my journey is that you are never alone – whether professionally or personally. There are times when you may think you are but you really are not. Communicate and communicate often. I find that whether you are on an FWA or not, communication solves most problems.” Victoria Brennan Victoria, a mother of four, started on an FWA after relocating from New Jersey to Baltimore. After commuting for three years, she finally moved her family to Baltimore and went to an 80% to 90% schedule to help transition her family. In her own words ... “Every time I reached a crossroads in my career path and talked to people who guided me, it always brought a different perspective. My mentors helped me think about what’s important to me and what challenges me, and, ultimately, what do I want. “I had a misguided internal fear that if I didn’t commit 100% of my time to work I would miss opportunities. Along the way, my mentors discouraged me from giving up, and we came up with unconventional ways to solve the issues. I figured out, you’re 100% in on 90% of the work. “You meet so many people throughout your career -- the biggest thing is to connect with them. If you communicate and trust those who support and guide you, you will find the right way. It might not be what you thought, but trust in the support around you.” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/37926.html</url><pwc_title>How will you say “thanks” today? 3 tips from Tax </pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:54:42</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:TaxTtes|source:Tax</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description> Saying thank you can go a long way.

But it’s not just what we give in thanks, it’s how we give it — here are three great suggestions: I think it's most meaningful to thank people in real time, whether that’s through RTR, a quick note or in person. There's nothing more important than acknowledging the caring that our people put into their day-to-day actions -- whether that means how they support their teams, create value for clients, or contribute to their community. - John Buchanan, Tax Managing Partner I like to recognize my fellow team members not only by issuing Real-time Recognition, but also by letting the manager/director/partner on the account know when a fellow team member does a great job. - Jacky Roznik, Tax Staff Advisory Council Alumna I believe it is important to get to know my team so I can be thoughtful about the type and level of appreciation that is appropriate and meaningful. The easiest way to show appreciation is to say thank you. I also believe that it is important to recognize when someone is making an effort. - Nodira Nosirjonovna Ismoilova, Tax Staff Advisory Council Looking for more ideas on how to approach recognition?

This week I am incredibly honored to host a webcast with leading voices on gender equity. Today is International Women's Day, and I'll be speaking to Working Mother President Subha Barry, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistRonan Farrow and HeForShe founder Elizabeth Nyamayaro about issues that matter to all of us. This is a continuation of the discussions we've been having as a firm and within our teams. Both inside and outside PwC, we've seen how change happens when we take on tough topics. On today’s webcast, we’ll talk about some of these changes — from the impact of the #MeToo movement, to trends in family care leave and the actions that organizations are taking to close the gender leadership gap. Team, I am humbled to represent all of you — and to learn from these three individuals. Elizabeth founded HeForShe as a way for men to stand as allies and speak up for gender equity. Ronan’s reporting in the New Yorker was instrumental in launching #MeToo. Subha brings 30 years of front-line business and leadership experience to the table. They have incredible experiences to share and I hope this conversation creates another opportunity for discussions inside PwC. Similar to when we've talked about race, inclusion and other topics, this is an opportunity for us to share our own experiences, listen to others and understand each other better. I know we all have different client demands and responsibilities — so we'll record the webcast so you can watch later on your own or with your team. I also have one other ask. As a firm, we have been a champion of HeForShe since its founding and have invited everyone to learn more and make a commitment. We are working toward a global goal of 80,000 commitments from PwC men. We only need 5,800 more to join us and we’ll meet our goal in the U.S. I hope you’ll join me in supporting HeForShe — click here to make your commitment. I’m looking forward to the discussion — I hope you can join us.

By design, our real-time development culture supports these behaviors, and our tech-enabled tools make it easy to give feedback to each other. Gain insight into your progression and impact through Snapshots We’re four months into the performance year. Mid-year coaching discussions are right around the corner, so now is the time to initiate and complete snapshots. Snapshots are your opportunity to get a point-in-time assessment of your progress against the PwC Professional framework and any differentiated impact you’ve had. It’s important that you capture this data throughout the year, so don’t delay. As a reminder, you should receive 6-12 Snapshots, covering 80% of your total hours worked during the performance year. You can add these reminders to your calendar (as appropriate): Sept. 28, Oct. 31, Dec. 21, Feb.28, Mar. 29, Apr. 16. Start, stop, or continue with upward and peer feedback As part of our Your Tomorrow journey, we’ve added upward and peer feedback in Workday as one of our real-time development tools. Through Workday, you can give, receive or request feedback with anyone in the global network. The tool provides an ideal opportunity to offer specific suggestions for behaviors -- what your colleague might stop, start, or continue to do in order to have greater impact. More points to consider: Use of the tool is optional. The purpose of is development, not evaluation. Completed feedback is immediately viewable by recipients, their Development Team, and their Talent Consultant/HR Professional. Upward and peer feedback does not replace our primary emphasis -- in-the-moment, on-the-job, real-time development conversations. We expect all feedback and language to be constructive and consistent with our values, Code of Conduct, and behaviors of a PwC Professional. Put yourself in the shoes of a recipient. Always use a constructive tone, and remember that our collective goal is to help one another grow and develop.

Our "Upskilling in Action" series celebrates the successes of some of your colleagues who are accelerating their digital skills and applying them on their projects and with their clients. On most days, William VanBuskirk, an Advisory experienced associate and Digital Accelerator based in Chicago, uses data visualization tools to synthesize information and present it in a visual and more impactful way. While with a client who was preparing for a major enterprise-wide digital transformation, he was tasked with finding a way to translate massive amounts of data into something meaningful. William worked hand-in-hand with the client to understand relevant use cases for visualizing their next generation of architecture across the enterprise and developed an analytics and visualization approach. Digital visualizations and recommendations were new capabilities to the client, so he drove digital adoption and sustainability by coaching the client analysts on how to perform the work themselves. William also helped his PwC team build their digital skills by sharing some of his Digital Accelerator learnings. By walking the client through demonstrations and examples that exhibit the value and possibilities of augmenting their work, William and his team built the client’s trust. This led to the implementation of the new dashboard and increased data transparency for the client. The client also greatly valued the ability to easily maintain the dashboard. Jimmy Lee, William’s director, summed it up best. “William takes the ‘magic’ out of going digital, and makes using new technologies and tools practical and approachable to his colleagues and clients.” William encourages everyone to check out all the digital learning content available in the Digital Hub — “Even if you only have an hour a week, you can learn so much in that time.” Want to build your own digital skills? A good place to start is the Digital Hub, the home to all things Digital Upskilling — available on PC and mobile via the Digital Hub app in PwC’s App Store. You’ll find pre-reads to get ready for PowerUp! games, Learning Bursts, Tech While You Trek podcasts, Digital Quests and more. And don’t forget our FY19 Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal for everyone at PwC — earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests on or before June 30, 2019. As an added incentive, get an early start through Learn2earn by completing all four Digital Quests and earning a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points before April 30 and you’ll be entered for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win!

Data Sieve for Leasing uses Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing to extract key terms from lease agreements in your audit sample, resulting in a digitized version of each lease and an Excel extract of key lease terms and clauses that can be quickly and easily reviewed. How does it benefit me? Through automation, the tool lowers the risk of manual error and allows you to easily view, filter, and search for lease terms all in one place, allowing you more time to focus on areas that require accounting judgment. We have used this tool successfully in many non-audit applications; its use in the audit channel is an exciting development in the Tech Enabled Audit, part of our Your Tomorrow strategy. How can my team get started using it? There are a few things to know: If your team elects to use Data Sieve, you will be required to use the SDC to assist with setup and processing of the leases within the tool. Data Sieve for Leasing is most appropriate for audit engagements where the audit client is the lessee, with over 30 leases in the audit sample. To determine if your engagement is eligible to use the tool, click here. The central team will help you determine if your engagement is a good fit. ASC 842 Adoption Calculator in Template Manager is an Excel-based tool that calculates the lease liability and right-of-use asset balances at the application date of ASC 842 of each lease in your sample. Here’s how it can help you: Clearly shows key data inputs for ease of comparison to client information Allows for standard documentation over the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset The tool is for internal use only. You can download the Calculator from Template Manager; you’ll find it under PwC Audit Practice Aids --&gt; General Assurance. Questions?

But for students to learn, educators first need to feel comfortable embracing these new technologies. This is a challenge we’re familiar with. Last year, 50,000 of us used the Digital Fitness app to assess our skills and identify areas for growth. It was such a valuable tool that, with the support of the firm, the PwC Charitable Foundation funded the creation of a customized version for educators, in support of our Access Your Potential initiative. This week, we shared the app with tens of thousands of teachers in the DonorsChoose.org network. Just like our people, educators begin by completing a digital assessment. Based on their individual results, they'll receive curated resources to help them get comfortable with tech concepts from AI to blockchain to coding. Building educators’ confidence According to a study we recently conducted, only 10% of K–12 teachers surveyed nationally feel confident incorporating higher-level technology, like coding and data analytics, into student learning. This uncertainty is even more acute in low-income school districts that lack funding for additional teacher training, putting their students at a further disadvantage — one of the many gaps in opportunity that keep these students from being prepared for the millions of available technology jobs. Well-prepared teachers can ignite a spark of interest in students by showing them the possibilities of technology — the “wow” of what’s to come, along with what it will take to get there. That spark is only possible if teachers understand technology and how to translate it into real-world terms that students can get excited about. This is who we are: a purpose-driven organization that invests in elevating society, our people and our clients. Share, share, share! Now that this version of the app is live, check it out and send along* to educators you know who might be interested. Digital Fitness for educators is just one way we’re helping meet teachers’ needs as we work together to get young people excited about technology. As Shannon Schuyler, our Chief Purpose Officer and Responsible Business Leader, says in a new blog post: “We need young people to become passionate about learning to code or designing an app because their livelihoods depend on it.” This is a critical mission, and it’s going to take all of us — educators, parents and the private sector — to make it happen. *Please use Internet Explorer to open the Google Play link.

FLEX your scheduling and budgeting muscles -- or mi Want strong teams? FLEX your scheduling and budgeting muscles -- or miss out on staffing your engagements! Tax Sept. 10, 2018 To continuously improve and streamline our Tax processes, FlexForecast (FLEX) is now the primary tool for busy season planning. As your single point of entry for budgeting and engagement change requests, FLEX will save time and reduce duplication of work. The final national deadline for Tax is to have FLEX budgets created and sent to Deployment by October 31. FLEX budgets should be created for all engagements that expect to incur 20 hours or more. Creating a FLEX budget ensures all known engagements are appropriately staffed and resource needs are identified. Note that this deadline should not override any earlier market specific deadlines set by your deployment consultant. Here’s how it works: 1. Go to Rapid Engage and search for the Opportunity name that you will create a budget for. Click “Budget” then “Complete the budget in FlexForecast” to begin. While going through Rapid Engage is optional, there are many benefits. Information like engagement leader, product code and fee amount will flow directly from Salesforce to the new budget and the Rapid Engage tracker will be linked to your budget. 2. Create FLEX budget. Important: Coordinate with other teams collaborating on a given engagement letter (contract) to populate ONE engagement budget with a tab for each project team (ex: 2018 Compliance including tabs for Fed, State and ITS). 3. Populate your expected team members and hours. Estimate expected fees to ensure resulting margin and IPR meet our targets. Indicate timing of hours in the Weekly Staffing tab. Important: Ensure that all staffing needs are accounted for -- including any unknown or TBD resources that the Deployment Community is still working on staffing. Additionally if a staff member has not been confirmed by Deployment, a TBD should be entered into FLEX. Please be sure to appropriately allocate hours by week for each staff member. The weekly hours in FLEX will be used to populate schedules in TalentLink. 4. By October 31, click “Send to Deployment” to submit the schedule to TalentLink. You may update your budget later if changes are necessary based on engagement letter negotiations. Once a FLEX budget is submitted, our Deployment Enablement Team will update TalentLink, and the Deployment Consultants will work through upcoming scheduling. If the engagement terms are not yet final, you do not need to finalize the budget at this time. You may update your budget later if changes are necessary before the work begins. 5. Work with Deployment to confirm staffing requests, and update FLEX budget as needed. 6. Finalize your budget once fees are agreed to and you are ready to open your WBS code(s). Any staffing hours updates not previously submitted will automatically be sent to Deployment. Finance/Leadership Review is required if IPR &lt; 80% and EM &lt; 40%, before the budget will be finalized. Don’t forget: FLEX is for more than just WBS code opening. Staffing has a direct impact on engagement economics. To ensure the economic impact of staffing decisions is considered and to minimize the duplication of efforts, FLEX is the single point of entry for engagement teams to make staffing updates. Changes made in FLEX will be pushed to TalentLink. Thanks to the connection between FLEX and TalentLink, we will have more accurate information about engagement team schedules and capacity -- a crucial step in achieving our Your Tomorrow, Project 5 Million goals and quickly recognizing the value of time gained through digitization.

What does this mean for me? When you submit a record for storage, the hard copy will be sent to a central, secure, offsite storage facility. When you request retrieval of a stored record, you’ll now receive it in digital format only, which improves security and controls over our client information. Once a record is digitized, it will be available almost immediately when you request it. However, be aware it could take up to five business hours for scanning and delivery the first time a stored file is requested. Records from engagements ending prior to 2016 will still be delivered in a physical format within two business days. You’ll still use RMS, our Records Management system, to submit external hard copy records for storage and to request stored records when you need them. Your local Office Services staff will still be on hand to help ensure all records are “checked-in” in compliance with our policies. We’re excited about the improved efficiency, control and security we’ll get with centralized records storage and digital delivery. If you have questions or need support adjusting to the new digitized records, please reach out to your local Office Services Manager.

Advisory - test April 22, 2019 What was the challenge ScanSource asked us to solve? Their business units operated in product silos, limiting the organization from effectively selling and servicing the full product portfolio across their client base. To adapt, ScanSource had a need to build a single sales organization, standardize roles and processes, incentivize sellers, innovate new solution offerings for the marketplace, and implement technology to support this journey. What was our solution for ScanSource? We defined a new Go-to-Market (GTM) model for ScanSource by re-segmenting their customer base, re-structuring their sales organization and re-designing sales compensation and territory model. To put the new GTM model into action, we leveraged our Sales and Marketing Excellence (S&amp;ME) Integrated Solution. S&amp;ME supports our Fit for Growth platform goal of fostering an environment for change to occur and culture to evolve. This goal is achieved by standardizing business processes, reducing manual handoffs across customer teams, and improving collaboration around customer needs. In a nutshell, we won ScanSouce because we... Differentiated ourselves by showcasing our Sales &amp; Marketing Excellence Integrated Solution, which is infused with ‘out-of-the-box’ best practices that would largely meet ScanSource’s needs in an efficient and best-in-class manner. Challenged the normal assumptions made in the design phase of such large transformations, and pushed boundaries to come up with a best-in-class solution for each business unit without over analyzing the current state. Leveraged Salesforce and UX resources from the Global Firm, specifically Poland and Canada, and Assurance resources for risks and controls assessment. Used an xLoS approach, by leveraging SDC, DIAC and third-party labor, which proved that we are better together versus in our organizational silos. Made change fun and exciting through gamification, sneak peak sessions, and multiple modes of training and help resources. What results will ScanSource see using our solution? Major shifts to operational, sales and performance metrics... Increase in: volume and quality of leads cross-sell and up-selling deal volume improved operating income collaboration and transparency Decrease in: case to resolution cycle time technical debt sales cycle time ….all leading to enhanced shareholder value. How is this win significant and what results will we see? Delivered with unprecedented margin of 41%, as a result of our accelerators, team and Global Firm staffing structure. A competitive showcase and compelling reference for future use. Highlights significant strides made with xLoS collaboration. Meet the team!

Some of our recent inclusion efforts include the 4REAL Blindspot training (firmwide), Coaching with an Inclusive Mindset training (senior associates and above), and the Inclusive Leadership and Belonging training (manager and above) taking place this week. Another way we execute the strategy is through our D&amp;I leadership development experiences. This fall, the Office of Diversity hosted five D&amp;I signature experiences for more than 600 of our minority and female professionals: Vanguard (Black/African American associates), Navigate Success (Hispanic/Latino associates), Accelerate (Pan-Asian associates), Diamond (underrepresented minority directors/senior managers) and Breakthrough Leadership (female directors/senior managers). Vanguard, our longest running D&amp;I signature leadership program, celebrated its 10th anniversary in Dallas this year with the theme “Be a part of the legacy.” Program alumni and various leaders, including several USLT members, shared their perspective on leadership and participated in an especially meaningful tribute in memory of our colleague Botham Jean, a 2016 Vanguard alum. Check out this video highlighting the 10 year journey of the Vanguard program. How can you help build a more inclusive culture? Ask about the experience. If you know a colleague who attended one of these programs this fall, ask them to share the experience with you -- it’s an opportunity to keep the conversation going and to foster a more inclusive culture. Reach out to your Market Diversity Leader to learn more about how you can get involved with other diversity and inclusion efforts. Consider joining an Inclusion Network to get involved, support and learn more! Why do we host D&amp;I leadership programs? Our D&amp;I leadership development programs are a part of the firm’s effort to help develop, advance and create a sense of inclusion for all of our professionals as we remain committed to maintaining a robust and diverse talent pipeline. Each program continues to build on the success of the attendees, and often gives them exposure to leaders with similar cultural backgrounds. “Bringing our complete selves to PwC will strengthen our innovative capacity, unleash the potential of our employees and thereby directly contribute to our purpose,” said Vikram Panjwani, Accelerate Partner Champion. More than 200 partners, senior managers, directors and human capital professionals joined the learners on these intense program journeys to share their experiences. In the spring, Select Senior will take a similar approach to enhancing our inclusive leadership culture as our leadership development program for diverse, high-potential senior associates. “These experiences encourage participants to embrace who they are and realize the value they bring to PwC. I am proud to have been part of Navigate Success, which helps advance and retain the amazing diverse talent we have at PwC,” said Gabe Alejandro, Navigate Success Partner Champion.

Lab notes: Save time by automating common tasks — plus Learn2earn! HQ News Jan. 15, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. This “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope their stories inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. If you could change one thing that you spend too much time doing during a project, what would it be? For Senior Associates Sarah Handley and Nara Yoon in the Private Company Services (PCS) Assurance group, that one thing drove them to create and submit multiple time-saving automations to Digital Lab. Inspired by what they learned in Digital Academies and encouraged to upskill and create automations as part of the PCS Innovation Competition, in which Sarah and Nara were the first and third place automation contributor winners, both took a hard look at what could be automated to make their jobs more efficient. (Haven’t attended a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion session yet? Find out more here.) Here’s how some of their automations are helping to save time while maintaining quality on audits: Alteryx workflows clean up client files so that unessential data and empty cells are removed, making them usable by PwC: The SAP AP Ledger Cleaner cleanses data and then applies the vendor ID and company name to each invoice within an AP subledger file. The SAP FI-Material- Valuation Report Cleanser cleanses data and then applies a location ID and material type ID to each inventory item within a SAP Inventory Valuation Report. The Confirmation.com Extract automation, which pulls relevant information from confirmation.com, cleanses the formatting, and builds a table of information that can help teams reconcile client trial balances. For a leasing company client, the operating lease table buildout workflow builds out a rent expense and deferred rent table for an individual operating lease, which can help teams recalculate rent expenses and deferred/accrued rent balances. “I was looking for a way to automate tasks and make it easier for staff — instead of having to go page by page and writing out all the details,” explained Nara. “With this [confirmation.com] workflow, you can focus more on auditing and confirming the balances are right instead of spending all that time on data gathering.” When Sarah and Nara needed assistance with these and other workflows, they found fellow Digital Academy attendees, the Digital Lab review team, and Digital Accelerators to be very helpful in answering questions and providing perspective on solutions. “When developing automations, it really helps to collaborate with others — including your team members or Digital Accelerators — because the end results will be significantly better than if you try to go it alone,” said Sarah. Sarah’s advice for others: Keep an eye out for opportunities to automate. “In PCS NY Metro, we’ve already asked everyone to think about the pain points you experience as you work on audits. This will help identify things we can automate to help us all,” she said.

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. When Deisi Alcantar joined PwC in July 2018 as an associate in the State and Local Tax financial services group, she recognized the potential impact that digital tools like Alteryx, Tableau and UiPath would have in her work. Although she and her team didn’t have prior experience with them, she was ready to learn and use the tools -- even if it meant teaching herself. Fast-forward six months: Deisi played a key role in creating several visuals for a client, showing year-over-year savings and delineating states that generated the most notices in the US. Data visualization of state by state savings. “The client was quickly impressed and excited to have these visualizations, as they often struggle to articulate facts to the main office and get push-back on engaging us to do the work,” said Caragh Deluca, Tax partner in Financial Services. It was a win for the team and a value-add for the client. Deisi’s learning journey with technology tools involved firm resources, trial and error and open communication with her team. In-person trainings (Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion sessions you can register for in Vantage) and the Digital Hub menu of options (Tech While You Trek podcasts, Learning Bursts, PowerUp! and more) help to upskill and stay up-to-date on the latest technology. Plus, conversations with her engagement team helped her focus and keep the bigger picture in mind. Before presenting to the client, she and her engagement team practiced with a mock meeting. “The engagement team and I played around with the different settings and filters,” said Deisi. “The end product was a visual story we were excited to share with the client.” A professional development opportunity Learning data visualization tools changed how Deisi and her engagement team worked with the client -- and enhanced her own digital knowledge and skills in the process. “If I hadn’t worked on data visualization, I wouldn’t have been able to see these trends,” said Deisi. “I was able to be more proactive helping the team meet the needs of our client.” It wasn’t always easy, but the experience has made a difference in her career. Deisi continues to learn new tools in Digital Lab, checking it at least once a week to see what’s new and to see what she or her team can use. As we use our technology tools on engagements and tell our digital story, it is important to remember our absolute commitment to independence. To avoid perceptions that PwC may be promoting or endorsing any one company, tool or product over another, do not to mention our clients, vendors or specific products or services by name or share client-specific data or visualizations.

After proudly serving 10 years active duty in the Navy, Corbin sought to make a career transition. Life at sea as a Surface Warfare Officer was no longer conducive to his family life. With a wife and (now) four kids, Corbin wanted to anchor home. But like many veterans, translating extensive military experience to the corporate world was an arduous task. Knowing he had an interest working in technology, a friend suggested Corbin check out PwC’s career page. There he found veteran resources and contacts that led him to a cybersecurity job at the firm. Today, in an effort to pay it forward and help other veterans, Corbin has become an active member of the firm’s Veterans Affinity Network (VAN) and voluntarily leads veteran recruiting efforts for cybersecurity professionals. “The ability to relate to your colleagues is important,” Corbin said. “I feel supported by the vast network of fellow veterans. I’m also pleased by the support we provide reservists and their families. I know firsthand the challenges imposed by military service on a person’s work/life balance. The flexibility we offer makes it easier on our staff and their families.” How PwC helps veterans belong We bring our values to life by attracting, developing and helping veterans, service members and military spouses succeed in the workforce and feel a sense of belonging. Some examples of our commitment include: Joining Google to host a day dedicated to the advancement of military veterans, service-members and their families. Encouraging PwCers to support veteran causes through Impact Space. PwC Charitable Foundation committing $10 million to assist more than 200,000 veterans and their children in overcoming barriers faced in education and career transition. "As a veteran myself, I fully appreciate the sacrifices and contributions all of our veterans have made,” said Tim Stoner, partner champion for our Veterans Affinity Network. “On Veterans Day and throughout the year, we say thank you to all veterans and their families." Note: Stay tuned for the latest episode of Well, Well, Well launching Monday, Nov. 12 on the PwC Podcast app. Host Cecilia Tse interviews Marine Corps veteran and Manager Joshua Hartley to discuss veteran wellness challenges. Following an old navy tradition, Corbin and his wife baptized their oldest daughter onboard a ship.

You think you’re OK from an independence perspective because you’re not providing audit services. But there are steps to take before you can be sure. Before you begin work on this client, you need to verify whether you have a financial relationship with this client OR any of its affiliates. Here are two actions you should take to avoid an independence exception: 1. Check the restriction status of the client. Search for the entity in the Central Entity Service (CES). Note whether there is a red X (restricted) or green check (unrestricted) associated with the entity. If there is a red X, your client is a restricted entity and you need to know if you have a relationship that would cause an independence issue. Move on to the next step below. 2. Review your financial relationships (investments and other financial arrangements) . If your client is a restricted entity, go to the Compliance tab of the entity in CES and download the Investment Independence List for a full list of entities that require review. If you have an investment in any of the entities on that list, you cannot provide 10 or more hours of non-audit services to the client. If you have an “Other Financial Arrangement” (e.g., bank account, loan, insurance policy) with an entity on the list, contact the Compliance Resource Center for guidance if you aren’t familiar with the respective policies. It may be permissible to keep the arrangement with certain caveats detailed in US Independence Policy. In the event that you would provide audit services, you would not be able to charge even one hour to the engagement while holding an investment in an entity on that list. Remember, independence rules also apply to your immediate family. If you have a spouse or spouse equivalent and/or dependents, the same independence rules that apply to you also apply to them. Have questions or need help? Be proactive and use the PwC personal independence tools available to you. For specific personal independence questions, contact the Compliance Resource Center (CRC) -- click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option 5 inside the US or from outside the US call 1-813-351-6491.

As you heard from Bob Moritz, one of our colleagues, Areeb Ahmed, was killed in the Christchurch mosque shootings. Areeb was a senior associate working in the PwC New Zealand Assurance practice. He was a loved and respected member of the team in Christchurch and his very promising life and career was cut short by this senseless violence. I’ve heard from PwC colleagues inside and outside the US who are feeling this very personally because they feel a connection to Areeb through our firm, through his faith, or through their connection to the region or to Areeb’s home country of Pakistan. Some of you have asked how we can share our sympathies or help in some way. If you have colleagues in our firm in New Zealand, please reach out and share your support. The local leadership team in New Zealand is working with Areeb’s family to determine how how we can collectively contribute. We have also created a page in our Giving site to let you support organizations responding to the violence in New Zealand. Team, I believe most of us want a world where we can live, worship and pursue our goals and dreams without fear. It’s only a very small group of people that cause so much pain and fear. With these terrible acts, I feel even more passionately that we must continue to stand for respect, for understanding and for having empathy for those who are different from us. This means living our values each day within PwC. It also means leading by example and asking others to join us. Just a couple of months ago, we honored Bo Jean by bringing over 150 companies together to have open conversations about race, bias and differences — and to understand the fears that our diverse colleagues live with each day. No one company, government or group can solve this alone, but we have to continue leading the way on this and doing our part as individuals and as a firm. Team, let’s remember all those who are hurting today — and especially Areeb’s family. And remember, we don’t know how these events may be affecting others around us — so please take extra care with each other and, when you ask others how they are doing, be ready to listen.

Senior Manager Christina Le shared, “Johnson &amp; Johnson heavily promotes Wellness Wednesdays. At 3 p.m., all their staff take a walk and we join in too. They also offer fresh fruit each morning.” She added, “Because we’re at the client site every day, we’ve been focused on our wellness and have made a commitment to new habits.” The team walks to the cafeteria to fill up their water bottles, and they keep healthy snacks on hand. They don’t use the elevators, taking the three flights of stairs at all times. Walking meetings take place regularly, often including the client. On Fridays, the team walks to a restaurant for lunch. An app to track Our Well-Being Rewards Program launched through our new vendor, Virgin Pulse. An added feature: partners now can join the program with staff. Leading by example, Engagement Team Partner Gerry Flynn was the first to download the app. In a Monday morning email to the team, Gerry encouraged them to activate their accounts. “It’s easy to get points right away – just for inviting colleagues,” he said. “Once they signed up, I created a step challenge and invited them to participate.” Now they have at least two challenges each week – Weekend Rumble and the Weekday Step-off (found under “Create a Personal Challenge” in the Virgin Pulse app). The team has 75 members across the US. So far, 25 have joined the challenges. Experienced Associate Niki Patel said, “We were impressed with how easy it was to pair our phones and tracking devices. With our step challenges each week, team members from interns up to partners stay connected. The app has encouraged us to get up from our desks and get moving.” “One benefit of being on Johnson &amp; Johnson’s campus is their goal to be the healthiest company in the world,” Gerry said. “It dovetails nicely with everything we’re trying to do through Be well, work well. It’s a natural fit and has been beneficial for us. Plus, it’s so easy to earn points, not only for physical activities, but financial and others too.” How has the app helped the team? “We definitely have more of a team dialogue now,” Christina said. “And even with the competitiveness, it’s had a positive impact on us. We talk more about things outside of work, helping us build our relationships further.” Gerry agrees. “The Virgin Pulse app has resonated with the team. It has solidified us. We talk about it daily as part of our well-being conversation. It’s a great way to get your team together on a common platform.” Haven’t joined the new Well-Being Rewards Program yet? It’s easy!

It was a proud and humbling moment to celebrate with these talented graduates who are now ready to make their mark on the world. As I told them, I’m incredibly excited for the Class of 2019. The opportunities to go out and make a difference have never been greater, and I see tackling inequality as the biggest opportunity for this generation to take on. My advice to them was to focus on three things: First, to be successful in whatever you take on, make it personal. You can’t fix an issue if you don’t feel it in your heart. Go out into the world, meet other people and listen to them. That will help you figure out where you can make a difference. Second, if you want to drive change, you need to be willing to be unpopular. Leaders like Rosa Parks, Abraham Lincoln and Gandhi helped to move our world toward equality, but they weren’t always popular while disrupting the status quo. Being a leader means questioning the world and pushing others to reexamine their own assumptions and move out of their comfort zone. Last, don’t go it alone. Building a community around you and asking for help when you need it will make you more successful. Hear Tim’s advice to graduates Read Tim’s full speech It was a great day and I feel very fortunate to represent our firm and all of you at events like this. Meeting many committed and values-driven people at Duke Fuqua -- as well as working with all of you -- gives me confidence that we can take on the tough issues and succeed.

It’s a significant undertaking but there are resources and people to help. One group leading the charge is the Tax Staff Advisory Council (SAC). We’re excited to announce our new members for F19/20 Tax Staff Advisory Council (SAC). This talented group of colleagues were nominated by their Market or Business Leader based on their leadership skills, collaboration and solution-oriented mindset. The members will serve a two-year term and will work on a topic-specific workstream in support of Your Tomorrow, Project 5 Million and other key strategic priorities and operational needs. “Communication will be key,” says Michael Neid, a senior associate in Tax. “I’m excited to be a part of local conversations, help Tax staff understand the bigger picture and work with my fellow national council members to make sure we reach our goals. Over the next few months the new council members will participate in conversations and meetings where they will outline their strategic areas of focus. These topics will include helping Tax to create the capacity it needs to be effective with its strategic priorities, staff engagement, focusing on the big picture, and any concerns that are shared within the local markets. Council members in their own words “I really appreciated the time the leadership took to help us understand the bigger picture behind the firm initiatives, leadership's openness to our feedback, and their candid responses to our questions and concerns. It was great to receive leadership's encouragement for the council to brainstorm and vocalize solutions the council believed to be important for future success of the staff, the clients and the firm overall.” - Nodira Ismoilova, Tax Manager and current SAC member “I am very excited about this continued opportunity in my two-year term to ‘carry the torch’ for my office, generating new ideas while bringing back valuable learnings from leadership to my market.” - Steven Pocoroba, Tax Director and current SAC member “Working side by side with a brilliant, dynamic and motivated group of like-minded individuals provided the opportunity to be on the forefront of change through our firm's initiatives. Also, knowing our US leadership team values our ideas and welcomes everyone’s feedback shows how passionate they are for continued growth within the firm and through our people,” - Marie Biondi, a senior associate and former SAC member Be a part of the conversation and get to know your market council member Remember, the Tax National SAC is here to help, but it’s important they hear from you. Did you know conversations are happening in your local markets? We encourage you to participate in these advisory council meetings.

In a recent meeting with the company’s executive leaders, Jenna Jones and Lauren Heim -- two senior associates -- spearheaded a technology demo that still has the client’s team talking about “what’s possible” with tech. This duo has worked with Ameren for approximately five years. In that time, they've been focusing on delivering a quality audit and actively talking with the client about the tools and technologies that we're implementing as part of the audit process. Turns out, they are interested in innovation and on a similar journey as well. Given the client’s interest in how we’re tech-enabling the audit, the team sprung to action and demonstrated some of the new tools and technologies we currently have at PwC, as well as some being developed for the future. According to the team, preparation took just one week, and left a lasting impression. During the demo, Ameren’s senior leaders were actively engaged and asking questions -- and the interactive dialogue has only continued from there. Now, this team is helping other teams in their office provide technology demonstrations to their clients. Beneficial for the client and our team "Presenting our technology gave our associates, senior associates and managers more exposure to upper level management, including the CFO, CAO, and CIO. The client really liked that we — the actual team members who work with their data every day — were showcasing the technology and what it could do.” - Lauren Heim “The experience also gave us all the opportunity to develop our digital acumen, build our digital IQ, and become a "team expert" on select technology. I’d encourage other teams to consider doing a similar tech demo for their own clients -- it gave us an important opportunity to show, not tell, how we’re tech-enabling the audit and how we’re well on our way to becoming a digitally enabled firm.” - Jenna Jones (Pictured: Ameren team) Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/28706.html</url><pwc_title>How one PwC team helped 11 Make-A-Wish kids take flight</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:18:47</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>newsType:Firmwide|source:Advisory test</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-05-07 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>Advisory test</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>How one PwC team helped 11 Make-A-Wish kids take flight How one PwC team helped 11 Make-A-Wish kids take flight Advisory - test May 7, 2018 When IPS Associate Chris Kohlenberger recently saw a Make-A-Wish advertisement as he was rushing through the Newark airport to catch a flight, he had no idea that he, along with the IPS Academy, staff and Partners, would be instrumental in sending at least 11 Make-A-Wish kids on their dream trips. “I noticed that the ad said ‘Over 70% of Make-A-Wish kids need airline miles to travel to their dream destinations,’ so I decided to connect frequent fliers with an abundance of points (US consultants) to the kids that really need them,” Chris said. Across the US, the Make-A-Wish® Foundation serves others by granting wishes to children with life-threatening conditions. This year, more than 75% of Wish kids will travel for their once-in-a-lifetime experience. As a result, Make-A-Wish needs 2.9 billion airline miles to fly Wish kids and their families to their destination of choice. Many major airlines enable frequent flier members to donate to Make-A-Wish. “Donating miles is a simple but meaningful way you can play a part in helping grant these wishes,” said Chris. So how’d he and the IPS Academy pull it off? It was simple.The IPS Academy Responsible Business Leadership (RBL) Lead, Roberto Gonzalez, fully supported the campaign and reached out to PwC’s national RBL team for additional guidance. Branden Elkins and Kelly O'Shea, the IPS Academy Leads, were equally as encouraging and put Chris in touch with the Academy Sponsors and Communications Team. Collectively, the group helped bring the campaign together. Through various communications, the Academy directed people to donate miles through a special site that Make-A-Wish created, and the team also accommodated for people to donate monetarily through PwC’s own Impact Space portal. The campaign ran officially from from April 1-29 -- which was World Wish Day, the anniversary of the first wish ever granted. IPS collected more than 550,000 miles, which should send about 11 children on the trip of a lifetime! While the official campaign is over, we can still collect miles and donations to contribute to Make-A-Wish! If you’re interested in donating your own miles, please visit the IPS Make-A-Wish Miles Donation portal. If you and your own team are interested in setting up a similar campaign, please reach out to Chris Kohlenberger (christopher.kohlenberger@pwc.com) for guidance. Thanks to the IPS Academy, staff and partners for living our PwC core value of caring.

We’re well-positioned to help clients transform their business through strategy, growth, trusted technology adoption and workforce development. We’re planning to continue promoting the campaign into FY20 and recently featured it at our Spring Exchange. Continue the discussion with your clients — as appropriate — by getting familiar with key resources in the Platforms Navigator (under Firmwide Campaigns), including a new conversation starter and our continually updated 4IR page on pwc.com (pwc.com/4iready). And check out this new video we’re now featuring online, which shows why PwC is the partner to help organizations get ready for the transformation ahead. A reminder There are important — and different — benefits for bringing our 4IR capabilities to our audit and non-audit clients. For audit clients, the focus will be on education and driving awareness of this seismic shift in how we live and work (and even play). It also ushers in a revolution of experience. And in the non-audit context, 4IR will help us empower leading organizations to intelligently apply technology to solve important business challenges. It’ll drive innovation and new business opportunities, while decreasing costs and increasing productivity to rise above current market volatility and a predicted economic downturn. Questions?

All tax professionals should have also received notification from the firm of a My Compliance Dashboard entry regarding their 2019 PTIN requirement on October 23, 2018. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN and updating your status in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database, you will be required to complete your My Compliance Dashboard PTIN requirement by the due date. As a reminder, the PTIN requirement is a three-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or approved exemption) in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database Complete your PTIN Confirmation requirement on your Compliance Dashboard The PTIN Requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2018 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2018 PTIN before you can renew for 2019. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2018 calendar year. The firm requires all personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must create an entry in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit. NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update your status in the database accordingly. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202)346-5219 or Mike McDermott at (949)437-5413.

These groups will receive separate communications regarding your Annual Enrollment elections. We all work hard and we need to take care of ourselves. That’s why we’ve made well-being a central part of Be well, work well and our Your Tomorrow commitment. We have many resources in place to help us play an active role in our personal well-being -- not only physically, but mentally, spiritually and emotionally. We’ve captured a snapshot of our many programs below*. * Eligibility varies for the programs listed in the chart. Today, we want to update you on Annual Enrollment, which is the time each year that we make choices about the PwC benefit plans that support our well-being throughout the year. PwC's Annual Enrollment starts on Wednesday, May 1, and ends on Wednesday, May 15, for benefits effective July 1, 2019. During Annual Enrollment, we encourage you to consider your medical plan options, and the benefits of participating in the vision, dental and legal plans and flexible spending accounts. One of the benefits of investing in Be well, work well and all of our well-being programs is that they help address an issue that’s important to our business and to society in general – rising healthcare costs. In our nation, medical costs have been rising at 3x the general inflation rate – PwC is not immune but we've elected this year to keep medical plan premium increases well below the national average. Last year there was no premium increase for medical plan coverage. This year, we have taken many steps to manage premiums so that they will only increase between $1 and $10 per pay period depending on your medical plan option. Annual deductibles in the High and Middle Deductible Plans will go up by $25-$100 for the plan year based on your plan/coverage level. In addition, costs for our dental, vision and legal plans will not change, and dental coverage will increase by $500 per plan year. We’re also enhancing the medical plan. Limits for outpatient physical, speech, occupational and cognitive rehabilitation therapy services, are moving from a 90 visit limit combined to 90 visits for each therapy type per plan year. If you don't want to make any changes to your benefits, you do not need to do anything; your current elections will carry over starting July 1, 2019, except for Flexible Spending Accounts – or FSAs. You must enroll/re-enroll in the Dental &amp; Vision FSA and/or the Dependent Care FSA if you want to participate starting July 1, 2019. Please see below for more on the upcoming annual enrollment.

If you participate in a PwC medical plan option and haven’t already elected to contribute to your HSA, or you want to contribute more, make your contribution elections during Annual Enrollment. (Note: You can change your election at any time throughout the year.) For information about how HSAs can benefit you, view the short video, How to Use Your HSA and participate in the webcast on May 2. (Note that the webcast will be recorded and available for replay.) Digital PT with Hinge Health. Another investment the firm recently made in our well-being is the addition of Hinge Health. Hinge Health offers an innovative, at-home digital physical therapy program using a tablet and wearable sensors to those suffering from knee and back pain and is available to our partners, staff and their family members (age 18+) who are enrolled in a PwC UnitedHealthcare (UHC) medical plan and meet the participation criteria established by Hinge Health. Review the PwC Inside article announcing this new benefit for more details. Reminder: Well-Being Rewards and LiveWell Resources. This past July, we introduced a digitally-enabled Well-Being Rewards Program, along with LiveWell Resources that offers six free mental health visits. These programs continue to provide important resources and tools to support your well-being, and you do not need to be enrolled in a PwC medical plan to take advantage of these benefits. Make your benefit elections May 1-15 for coverage effective July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 If you’re enrolled in the High, Middle or Low Deductible Plan and don’t make an election during Annual Enrollment, your current medical plan elections will carry over on July 1, 2019. If enrolling in the High, Middle or Low High Deductible Plan for the first time, an HSA will be opened automatically for you if you don't already have one. It’s important to make contributions to the HSA to help pay for medical expenses such as deductibles and coinsurance. (You will need to complete the verification process in order for your account to be fully functional. If you previously closed a HealthEquity HSA, you will need to contact HealthEquity to reopen an account.) If you are currently enrolled in the dental, vision and/or legal plan, your current coverage will continue on July 1, 2019, unless you make a change during Annual Enrollment. Flexible Spending Account elections will not automatically carry over—you must enroll/re-enroll at Benefits Express between May 1 and May 15. Make elections at Benefits Express via mybenefits.pwc.com.

We’ve done a few things to simplify the process and make your life easier: Start in Rapid Engage. Make it your new, go-to tool. If you’re still stuck in holiday mode, don’t forget about Rapid Engage. Hint: It does some of the work for you. The tool overlays our existing client and engagement acceptance systems, including A&amp;C, AFS, engagement contracts, our budgeting tools, myEngage and others. So, for example, instead of having to log into separate systems, Rapid Engage will start drafts of EAFs, Authorization for Services forms (if needed), myEngage code requests and more for you, and then provide you with the links to finish them up! Bookmark Rapid Engage and use it -- it’ll help make 2019 better. There’s a new, combined EAF in town. We’re making your life easier by combining three legacy consulting Engagement Acceptance Forms (EAFs) into one Consulting Services Engagement Assessment form. The legacy forms for Advisory Services, Assurance-led Consulting Services and Litigation &amp; Dispute Services are a thing of the past -- eliminating the guesswork and, if/when needed, routing you straight to the appropriate Risk Management Partner for the service you’re providing. (You may remember, we’ve organized our specialist areas in OFRO by service offering, instead of by line of service or business unit.) Speaking of Rapid Engage … did you know it’s going live in Mexico? That’s right! Starting Monday, January 14, our Mexico teams have access to Rapid Engage, too. Spread the word and encourage your colleagues to use it. Have questions? Check out the OFRO portal and explore Rapid Engage today.

Read on below for more information on these two important changes: Regarding the topic of independence assessments, USIP now reflects the required use of the My Independence Assessment tool to facilitate all independence assessments. As discussed in Friday’s Assurance line of service PwC Inside article, use of the My Independence Assessment tool, which automates the independence assessment process for engagement teams, is now required. Previously, teams had the option to use the self-guided instructions in the Independence Assessment Toolkit — instead of the new tool — for US-only assessments. Now, all assessments must be conducted through the My Independence Assessment tool. Regarding affiliates, USIP now clarifies the application of the firm’s policies regarding the definition of affiliates of SEC audit clients. Specifically, it explains an entity that is controlled by a significant influence/material investee (SIM) affiliate of an SEC audit client is also an affiliate of the audit client, regardless of whether the controlled entity is material to the audit client. Please note: these policy changes go into effect on Tuesday, April 16, 2019.

Sadly, we were also reminded once again that bigotry and intolerance of the beliefs of others can have tragic consequences. The bombings that took place in churches and hotels in Sri Lanka resulted in hundreds of lives lost. I’m sad for those killed as well as those who are feeling this personally because of their ties to Sri Lanka, or their shared faith. The ability to be ourselves -- and follow our beliefs freely -- is essential to who we are and an important element of the diversity we celebrate within our firm You’ve heard me say it before -- but as we continue to see hatred and violence, we need to talk about these issues and continue to do our part to create a safe and respectful environment for each of us.

If you’ve been on LinkedIn or other social media apps lately, you may have also noticed that quite a few of your PwC connections are already getting theirs. Feeling a bit behind? Don’t worry! We’ve answered your top questions on Digital Quests below, including how to get started so you can show off your shiny new Digital Acumen knowledge badge in no time: What are Digital Quests? Digital Quests are real-life consumer and business scenarios and problems that require you to use your digital skills to find the solutions. You'll see work samples, listen to client needs and take on the perspective of different characters as you tackle each assessment and put your digital skills to work. Completing the four Digital Quests will earn you the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. You can access them on the Digital Quest page of the Digital Hub on your PC or mobile device. What are digital badges / the Digital Acumen knowledge badge? Digital badges are a new way at PwC to showcase the skills and knowledge that we’re gaining to succeed in today’s changing world and help our clients tackle their biggest challenges. They are visible, portable symbols of our journey as infinite learners, reflecting our achievements, ambitions and experience. They are designed — and encouraged — to be shared on TalentLink, social media and through email — so you can market your learning accomplishments in and outside the firm. The Digital Acumen knowledge badge is earned by completing the four Digital Quests. This badge represents an understanding of the core digital skills that are the foundation for Digital Upskilling, and your ability to leverage that knowledge when scoping engagements and leading conversations internally and with clients. If I’ve attempted a Digital Academy or other technical training, can I earn my Digital Acumen knowledge badge without completing the four Digital Quests? No. You must complete all four Digital Quests to earn a Digital Acumen knowledge badge. Why should I complete the Digital Quests? By completing all four Digital Quests, you’ll meet our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal of earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. Our goal is for everyone to earn their Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30. Learn2earn provides an extra incentive to reach our goal early — if eligible staff complete their Digital Quests and earn a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points before April 30, they’ll be entered to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — one in seven will win! What is the deadline for earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge? The goal is for all staff and partners to earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30. How do I get started? Head to the Digital Hub available on PC or mobile device by downloading the Digital Hub app from PwC’s App Store!

You can expect to receive your badge via email within six business days (the timing of issuing badges will be adjusted for firm holidays). Once you receive your badge, be sure to share it on TalentLink, LinkedIn and social media, keeping in mind these social media do’s and don’ts. See this quick start guide for information on how to share your badge.

Little did she know that her move would lead to a defining moment for her career and for the firm. When Hurricane Irma hit Florida’s West Coast, Wendy was the only member of the US-based Americas IT customer support Help Desk team who wasn’t living in the area -- so it was up to her to solve the problems that arose as a result of the storm. Here’s more from Wendy: Tell us a little bit about your current role at PwC. I’m a member of the Americas IT organization, which supports our IT infrastructure and firm applications across the US, Canada, Brazil, the Caribbean and some of Latin America. I’m on the IT Customer Support team, which means I’m on the front line of helping our people address their IT issues. I’ve been with the help desk for nine years. What was Hurricane Irma like for you? In the lead up to the storm, the path of the hurricane started moving west, and we realized it had the potential to impact the Tampa ESC, where my entire US team is based, along with the IT headquarters. Everyone was understandably preparing for the storm, and I was in North Carolina. I told them, “Go take care of your families and your homes, and I’ll take care of the help desk.” On Saturday, PwC Security called the help desk with a problem: They didn’t have the capacity to handle the number of calls they anticipated from staff and partners seeking help. I worked all day Saturday, Saturday night and into Sunday in collaboration with our offshore team to come up with a solution that would allow calls to be routed to more than one person at a time. On Sunday morning, I trained Lisette Martinez, a member of our PwC Security team, on the new solution, just as the storm was beginning to hit Florida in full force. But there was more to come -- on Sunday night the power went out in the Tampa ESC, disrupting call routing for various call centers. I woke up Monday morning to find that the emergency hotline calls were not going to route as planned at the scheduled time. After I notified the appropriate leaders about the issue, the IT Help Desk was asked to take the calls for the Emergency Hotline. I immediately began training our offshore center, who had never taken emergency hotline calls. We got the calls rerouted there so that we could continue to offer critical support to our people, who were calling in with requests for everything from back-up generators to temporary housing, in the middle of one of the worst natural disasters any of them had ever experienced. During the storm, I took on a broader role -- supporting PwC Security in whatever they needed. It became a “Do whatever you have to do” situation. We ended up fielding about 200 calls to the hotline related to Hurricane Irma, and every single one of them was able to get through, despite the problems we were dealing with behind the scenes. Looking back at the experience, how did you demonstrate our purpose in your response? A lot of it was about trust -- people trust that the firm will be there for them in times of incredible need. It’s one of the things that makes us special. People can’t call the emergency hotline during a hurricane and get a busy signal or a “Sorry, your call can’t be answered at this time.” It just can’t happen. So we had to think outside the box, and do things we hadn’t done before, and that definitely made me feel like I was solving an important problem. How did this experience help you find meaning in your work? Working on the help desk, I don’t always get to see the immediate impact of what I do every day, because so much happens behind the scenes. We work hard every day to meet the expectations of the firm, but if we are doing our job well, things are running smoothly and it may not even be noticed. With a situation like this, I could see the direct and immediate impact of what I was working on, and it was really energizing to see how my experience and skills helped me create quick workarounds in this high-pressure situation. I had a purpose, and that purpose was to ensure there was no downtime, no impact and no bad experience for anyone being affected by Irma. The commitment the firm has made that the emergency hotline would be there for partners and staff, no matter what -- delivering on that was my purpose. It doesn’t take a natural disaster to be a hero. Whether we’re conducting a forensics investigation, implementing a new technology or helping clients navigate a merger, people place their trust in us when the stakes are high. No matter what our role, we all have opportunities to go above and beyond to deliver our work and find meaning in what we do every day. How does our purpose resonate with you?

Here are the essential things you need to do ahead of Career Roundtable (May 15-31 for client service; May 6-22 for IFS). All staff Initiate, complete and acknowledge Snapshots before the April 30 deadline (system closes at 11:59 p.m. ET). Remember, Snapshots should cover 80%+ of your total hours worked (excluding vacation, holidays and other paid time off). See below for LoS reminders. Review An Inside look at the Career Roundtable and Career Outlook to learn more about the CRT, including how it works, who’s in the room and what’s discussed. Connect with your Development Team (as needed) to discuss your performance impact, progression and development. Relationship Leaders Check the status of your assignees’ Snapshots and reach out to your assignees or the reviewers, if needed. Attend your LoS/IFS year-end training session or replay (see Google site) Leverage resources on the RL Year-End Playbook Google site. *LoS reminders: Advisory: Snapshots for Advisory staff should include contributions to Digital Upskilling and to the development and adoption of our Integrated Solutions. Here is additional guidance on how to capture these important activities. Assurance: Assurance staff who do not have 80% of total hours worked covered in Snapshots by 4/30 must follow the FY19 &lt;80% Hours Guidance. As a best practice, we suggest you initiate a practice contribution Snapshot to your Relationship Leader or Career Coach to assist you in reaching 80% of hours covered. Tax: Snapshots for Tax staff should include contributions to Project 5 Million. Please see the Tax — Digital Impact through CRT slide for additional information on how to capture your P5M and digitization impact.

We’ve got your Last-minute work to do -- but childcare falls through? We’ve got your back-up Office of Diversity Nov. 26, 2018 Imagine this: You’re on the hook for a big deliverable and your child falls ill, unable to go to daycare. Or you’re in the middle of an already chaotic work week, and a partner asks you to travel out of state to help pitch the client of your dreams, but your primary caregiver isn’t available. Who’s going to watch your kids? These are the exact situations Layna Dugan and Vladimir Anichkin found themselves in recently. “My son had a bad ear infection and wasn’t able to go to daycare, but I had a looming deadline for a big deliverable that I couldn’t move,” said Layna Dugan, a senior manager with our Internal Communications &amp; Change team. “I called a babysitter and had her come to my house so I could be close to my son if he needed anything, but also allowed me to get my work done. I was easily reimbursed for the money I paid out of pocket.” Last-minute support Vladimir Anichkin found himself in a similar situation and was also able to use the back-up benefit. “My wife is our primary caregiver, watching our kids full-time,” said Vlad, a manager in the Hallandale Experience Center. “But on the week a partner asked me to travel unexpectedly, I was supposed to watch our kids because she had prior commitments that were going to keep her from being able to watch them.” Knowing that PwC’s Dependent Reimbursement Program will pay up to $1,000 per fiscal year for back-up childcare, Vlad quickly called his mom, who lives out of state, and asked her to fly down to Florida. She was on the next flight. The program provides monetary reimbursement when an employee’s normal caregiver is not available. Vlad simply paid his mom a per diem for her time, and by filling out a quick form, he saw the funds in his paycheck the following month. “I didn’t think I’d ever have to use this benefit, but it ended up being a lifesaver in a last-minute pinch. My wife could keep her commitment and I got to pitch my dream client,” he smiled. Learn more about PwC benefits that give you the flexibility to be your best at home and at work.

In Austin for SXSW, the bus experience was covered by multiple local news outlets, including KXAN (click here for the full video). The set-up at SXSW included a chalk wall, where people could write why they act on diversity and inclusion, and every single spot was filled with responses demonstrating how passionate people are about this issue. The Check Your Blind Spots tour has been sparking dialogue with fellow signatory organizations around issues of shared importance. Once the USAA tour stop was finalized, the USAA account team proactively worked to create an experience that would not only educate team members on unconscious bias, but strengthen their relationship with a key client. In addition, the week before the event, the USAA client came to New York for an in-depth conversation around our digital upskilling journey and work in diversity and inclusion. Over 200 USAA employees and 50+ PwC team members went through the bus! It was a fantastic and eye opening experience for everyone, and we've continued to make the content a part of our team meetings since the event. It’s clear that diversity and inclusion is important to us and to our clients. In less than two years, more than 600 CEOs have signed the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™ pledge, and the coalition continues to showcase the power of collective action. As you discuss this topic with your clients, make sure you’re well-versed in the resources and services we offer through the Workforce of the Future platform and our Office of Diversity. Why do you act on diversity &amp; inclusion? Take the I Act On pledge today, talk about your commitment and ask your teams and clients to do the same. Don’t forget to follow the Check Your Blind Spots tour schedule here to experience it when it’s in your neck of the woods, and follow the tour on Twitter (@CEOAction) and Instagram(@CEO_Action)!

Be well, work well and Digital Fitness Night of the living ... Be well, work well and Digital Fitness People Team June 25, 2018 Pop culture has captivated audiences with imagery of zombies rising from the dead to take over the world. But if there WERE a zombie apocalypse, would you be prepared? Our Bay Area Google account team doubts it will happen, but they’re training anyway. Embracing our Your Tomorrow strategy, the team took on two challenges -- increase wellness activities and build their Digital Fitness. And they’re having a blast doing it! Be well, work well One Friday every month, the team travels to a local gym for an intense hour-long Zombie Apocalypse Survival Training class, focused on core and group exercises. Partner Emmet Daly introduced the unique class to his team. “I wanted to engage them in a fun activity that promotes wellness,” Emmet said. “To survive a hypothetical zombie apocalypse, an individual needs to tap into all four dimensions of their energy: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. In the Zombie Apocalypse Survival Training class, similar to many Crossfit classes, participants use different types of equipment -- sandbags, kettlebells, slam balls -- that challenge their core strength and coordination. We motivate each other to get through the session. It’s a true team experience!” Emmet initially thought the training session would be a one-time event. However, the team enjoyed it so much, it’s now a monthly ritual. Manager Kalil Samra looks forward to the workouts and sees a positive difference in team morale. “It’s great to come together and tap into the four dimensions of energy outside the office. Sometimes it’s difficult to get to the gym after work due to our hectic schedules. Zombie Apocalypse Survival Training is a fun way to take time off from work to exercise with your teammates. We bond, have fun and emerge a little fitter each time,” he said. Digital Fitness Recognizing that technology would also be another major advantage we have over zombies, Emmet also posed a second Your Tomorrow challenge to his team, this time through Digital Fitness. “Everyone, from partner to associate, is tasked with developing two bots in six months. The bots will be used on our client engagement. We’ve rolled out the training and technology needed for everyone to accomplish this goal and look forward to impressing the client.” Senior Associate Vidhi Dave was the first teammate to pilot Robotics Process Automation (RPA) in testing Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley 302 certification requirements. With little background in RPA, Vidhi successfully built her first robot in just two days. Vidhi simply watched tutorials available on Vantage, YouTube and UiPath, and met with Kallil, her manager, to facilitate the elearning. “It’s nice to see the firm encourage innovation that not only adds value to the engagement but also to your skill set,” Vidhi says. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to self learn and raise my digital IQ in the regular course of our engagement.” Follow the team on Instagram to see how they keep up with well-being and Digital Fitness. More importantly, keep up with your own wellness and Digital Fitness progress -- download our new tool to help on your journey. You can also visit our Be well, work well Spark page and keep progressing in the Digital Fitness app. Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know!

Adam Pannone in spin class — every sport led to his team’s “hiking” goals! Update: Since this article was first published last year, Adam attended a Digital Academy and is now a Digital Academy instructor, and a Digital Accelerator. As an Army reservist, he stays committed to his service as an instructor at the US Army's Command and General Staff College, where he received the US Army Reserve's 2018 Instructor of the Year award. He was also promoted to Lieutenant Colonel last summer. Adam stays connected to his team as they continue to integrate their Be well, work well goals by making movement a priority. They also never miss an opportunity to show appreciation to those around them. Team "Ocean’s Ten" wanted to do something physical for the Be well, work well habit challenge and they wanted their goal to involve travel. So, where did they go? "To the top of the Himalayas, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mount Ararat and Mount Everest," said L&amp;D Senior Manager Adam Pannone. Not literally, of course. To “reach” these landmarks, they used spatial data tools to simulate what it would feel like to actually be there. "For example,” Adam explained, “along our journey we pulled pictures from the internet to see what the trek and peaks looked like. We also encouraged each other to use our imaginations as much as possible.” Competition among them was nonexistent. "Everything counted, some contributed more ‘miles’ than others by whatever activity they chose, but we all pulled together. There were no single goals — it was us against the mountains," he said. The team decided to track miles collectively, no matter the activity or tracking tool, to reach a new and exciting '’destination" each week. Along the journey, Ocean’s Ten expanded their global acumen by immersing themselves in the culture of their simulated surroundings, sharing their knowledge through team emails and videos. "We learned firsthand the team that climbs together, stays together,” said Adam. “There's strength in numbers; this challenge brought us closer." You can do it! Whether racking up miles with walking meetings, running, cycling, pilates or other activities, when they met each milestone, they celebrated and continued their climb until they reached the next goal. "We cheered each other on by saying 'you can do it, only a few more miles to get to the next mountain top,'" said Adam. They coupled their efforts with better food choices — and a healthy dose of gratitude. How did they do, overall? "We surpassed our goal by logging a total of 1,719 miles over the three-month period, which was way more than expected," he said. When they climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro, Adam felt compelled to write his wife a letter reflecting the sense of awe, gratitude and wonderment he was feeling. "It began as a physical challenge, but morphed into so much more," he said. They reached their final destination, the summit of Mount Everest, the last week in April. For Ocean's Ten, the Habit challenge also surpassed the physical. "It fueled our emotional energy," said Adam. "I can't think of a better firm initiative; it allowed us to address the whole person." Why the team title? "There are 10 of us. We're missing George Clooney, but otherwise we're a cohesive team that bonded along our journey toward wellness," he said.

Here's what you need to do You must complete a "notification" AFS for C2 GPA clients in the same manner as you would for a restricted entity. This means the "notification" AFS must be completed, and submitted to the Global Relationship Partner ("GRP") listed in CES before you execute the engagement contract and before you begin work ("engaging" with the client). A "notification" AFS is required for all related entities of C2 GPA clients. You will need to search for your client in CES. If your client is not designated as restricted or as a C2 GPA client in CES, you must also be sure to check the GPA list included on the Global Client Portal. Note: You should also check the status of the client’s domestic and global ultimate parent. If the parent is a C2 GPA, you will need to prepare a "notification" AFS for any work performed for it and its subsidiaries and related entities. Although C2 GPA clients are not audit clients, a "notification" AFS is still a control for the Firm so that the GRP listed in CES for C2 GPA clients and related entities is notified of new services (accordingly, the AFS does not need an "approval confirmation" from the GRP listed in CES). Identifying and submitting the appropriate notifications for C2 GPA clients and their related entities requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. Additional information is available in the Channel 2 Guide: Preparing a Channel 2 AFS Request found under the AFS Help - Policy Guidance section in the AFS system. For further information contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

As we kickoff the second half of FY19, I first want to reiterate how incredibly impressed I am with our team and the impact we’re making with our clients. If you saw my video message, $2.7B and counting, you know that this achievement is a record high for us and our strategy is truly setting us apart from the competition. Heading into the last two quarters of the fiscal year, let’s move forward with these things in mind: ● Commit to digital upskilling: Our investment in digital is helping us address the needs of clients, but more importantly, it’s providing you with a unique development opportunity to gain skills for the future. As you’ll see below, one of our biggest priorities this quarter is to get everyone trained to contribute to and use automations from Digital Lab. If you have not yet attended Digital Academy, please sign up via the link in the Your Tomorrow section. ● Bring your ideas to the table: The power of digital upskilling comes when we see it action, just as we saw with one of our teams at NBCUniversal.

Delivering as One Firm: Risk &amp; Regulatory Platform in Action Our Forensics team across the US and Mexico provided solutions to a company that is engaged in the operation and development of power generation facilities. The team was tasked with evaluating the policies and procedures, as well as the accounting controls, which the client had in its subsidiaries across several countries. Through this evaluation, the client was better able to make decisions regarding process improvement for their compliance program. A key differentiator in this win was the combination of capabilities brought by the Forensics team in Mexico and New York. Shoutout to the team -- Manny Alas, Bill MacMillan, Mónica Ribas, Raymundo Lira, Alfredo Hernandez and Margarita Cansino!

In the era of Trump, how resilient are US markets? Office of Government Sept. 13, 2018 by Roslyn Brooks (For internal use only) We’re currently riding the longest-running bull market in history. But the continued political discord in Washington and the upcoming midterm elections could threaten the market’s rise, and ultimately break this trend. Will the good economic times last? Can they? Will the positive Trump-US markets trend continue? Since President Trump’s inauguration one year and seven months ago, the benefits of the administration’s pro-business, deregulatory efforts appear to have outweighed the risks associated with uncertainty caused by some of the president's actions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached an all-time high in June, while the S&amp;P 500 surpassed its previous all-time high set in January. Powered by a rebound in consumer spending and business investment in the wake of tax reform, unemployment is at historic lows, corporate earnings are high, and GDP grew at 4.1% -- the strongest pace in nearly four years -- during the second quarter this year. This happened as President Trump pulled out of -- or threatened to pull out of -- multiple international agreements, alliances, and trade deals and proposed tariffs on goods imported to the US by traditional US allies. These actions, coupled with continued inquiries and investigations into various aspects of the Trump campaign and administration, eventually could provide enough uncertainty to unsettle global markets. As of yet, the US economy has remained mostly unaffected. Stocks continue to rise, breaking one record after another. The president’s trade negotiation tactics, however unorthodox, have so far produced positive results. The threat of US tariffs on goods from traditional and non-traditional US allies has brought many countries to the negotiating table to reexamine decade-old trade policies. For example, after a year of negotiations to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Trump administration recently informed Congress that it will sign a new agreement with Mexico in late November, while negotiations to include Canada in a three-way pact continue. Furthermore, talks between the US and European Union (EU) regarding lowering transatlantic commercial trade barriers are underway. The negotiations stem from a July agreement which suspended the president’s threat to raise US duties on EU automobiles and worked to resolve their dispute over steel and aluminium tariffs, while working to achieve a bilateral trade deal. While US markets largely have maintained status quo in response to these global entanglements, economists warn the US economy could begin to slow if the US engages in an all-out trade war with China. Trade tensions and tit-for-tat diplomacy between the US and China have recently increased. In early July, the US began implementing duties of 25% on $34 billion in Chinese goods, prompting a swift reaction from China, which introduced an equivalent 25% tariff on $34 billion in American goods. The US Trade Representative recently implemented 25% tariffs on its list of Chinese imports worth $16 billion. To no surprise, China is expected to announce its own 25% tariffs on $16 billion of US goods in retaliation. President Trump has said there is “no time frame” for ending the dispute with China and has urged Americans to be “patient,” but some question whether patience could run dry if tariffs significantly affect farmers, steelworkers, and automakers -- many who represent the president’s base of supporters. If the president’s actions on trade negatively impact the economy, which has historically been a deciding factor for many voters, it could create additional challenges for Republicans in the November midterm elections. Congress With midterm elections less than two months away, the remainder of the congressional agenda is likely to be driven by must-pass legislative items and politics. House lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill last week, and Congress only has 28 joint legislative days scheduled before the end of the year (and they may leave early to campaign). On the policy front, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization, the Water Resources Development Act, and government funding for fiscal year 2019 will garner immediate attention. Government funding is set to lapse after Sept. 30. Both chambers have been working to pass appropriations measures, but President Trump has threatened to shut down the government if Congress refuses to vote to fund a wall on the southern border. The full Senate is expected to hold a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court before the Court begins its new term Oct. 1. Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing began last week, and with the slim 51-49 majority held by Senate Republicans, there is little room for error. Barring an unforeseen development, it is likely Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Court. 2018 midterm elections Democrats need 23 seats to take the House majority and some political pundits have hinted at a “Blue Wave” of dramatic gains. However, change is coming to Washington whether there is a blue wave or no wave at all. In the next Congress, there will be at least 74 new House members due to retirements, resignations, and deaths alone. The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter that analyzes campaigns and elections, has 39 House seats currently held by Republicans rated as “toss up” or worse, a number that puts Democrats within striking distance of gaining control of the House. Democrats must score a net gain of 46 seats or more to achieve a majority that matches the current House GOP majority, and anything short of a 60-seat gain could present a challenge for House Democrats to achieve policy priorities. However, Republicans could retain the majority, although likely with a smaller margin than it has today, resulting in similar policy challenges. In the Senate, the notion of a Democratic political wave will likely meet a Republican geographic seawall. Democrats are defending 26 seats in November, compared to just nine for Republicans. Of those 26, ten seats are in states won by President Trump, with five in states he won by nearly 20 points or more during the 2016 election. Conversely, just one Republican seat is in a state won by Hillary Clinton. A Pew Research Center study of regular and special Senate elections held since 2013 (the last two election cycles) found that 69 out of 73 were won by the party carrying that state in the most recent presidential election. That’s potentially good news for Republicans, given that every Senate race in 2016 was won by the same party that prevailed in presidential balloting for that state. With the Senate expected to retain a tight majority no matter the party in control, legislative gridlock may be on the horizon following the midterm elections. In gubernatorial races this year, Democrats are defending nine seats compared to Republicans’ 26 seats. The outcome at the state level likely will have an impact on congressional maps drawn after the 2020 census and could reverse Democrats’ decade of state and federal losses. State and local There have been important developments at the state level in the area of professional services taxes. California remains at the forefront of state efforts to impose taxes on professional services and currently has a bill under consideration that ties a narrow tax on professional services to a redistribution of perceived corporate gains arising from the passage of federal tax reform. The bill would impose a tax of .75% on professional services beginning Jan. 1, 2020, which would rise to 1.5% in 2021 and again to 3% in January 2022. While healthy revenues from California’s current economy may have been key in aiding efforts to oppose the legislation, the issue is not off the legislative agenda in California. In Arizona, a coalition led by the Arizona Association of Realtors is seeking passage of Arizona Proposition 126, which would amend the state constitution to prohibit the imposition of professional service taxes by all government entities in that state. The electorate will vote on the measure in the November election, and current polling has it passing. Legislatures across the nation are also responding to the #MeToo movement by passing new laws to address sexual harassment. These bills range from bans on non-disclosure clauses in settlement agreements or employment contracts to outright bans on arbitration in sexual harassment disputes. Some bills bar employers from using arbitration in employment disputes altogether. For example, the New Jersey Legislature recently advanced out of Senate committee a bill that would not only ban arbitration agreements in employment contracts altogether, but also ban concealment of sexual harassment settlements. For its part, the California Legislature recently passed nearly a dozen bills introduced in this area, including measures to extend the statute of limitations on sexual harassment suits, requirements that employers maintain records of sexual harassment complaints, workplace protections for sexual harassment victims, and bans on employment arbitration. These bills await Governor Jerry Brown’s signature. We expect additional states to introduce similar legislation aimed to address sexual harassment in the coming months. SEC and PCAOB Last week, the Senate voted 85-14 to confirm the nomination of Elad Roisman to serve as SEC Commissioner. Commissioner Roisman formerly served as Chief Counsel to the Senate Banking Committee and fills the vacancy left by the departure of Commissioner Michael Piwowar, a Republican appointee. Commissioner Roisman’s confirmation could have implications for the timing of the president’s nomination or the Senate’s consideration of someone to fill the seat currently held by Commissioner Kara Stein, a Democratic appointee whose term has expired and who is ineligible to serve past December. Absent Commissioner Roisman’s confirmation, the SEC would have been left with three commissioners after Commissioner Stein’s departure, potentially giving Commissioner Jackson, a Democratic appointee, the ability to deny the quorum required for SEC action under agency rules. The Senate’s confirmation of Commissioner Roisman means that SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has the ability to move forward with regulatory action after Commissioner Stein’s departure if he, Commissioner Peirce and Commissioner Roisman are aligned. In June, the SEC adopted amendments to the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) requirements for operating companies and funds; released a strategic plan focusing on the long-term interests of Main Street investors; and adopted amendments to the definition of a "smaller reporting company." Under the new definition, a company with less than $250 million of public float will be eligible to provide scaled disclosures, while companies with less than $100 million in annual revenues and either no public float or a public float less than $700 million will now also be eligible to provide scaled disclosures. Recently, Chairman Clayton said he “expects the Commission will be taking a fresh look at the thresholds" for Sarbanes-Oxley section 404(b) over the next several months. President Trump recently tweeted that he asked the SEC to study replacing reporting for publicly traded companies from quarterly to a semi-annual system. Chairman Clayton released a public statement saying the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance "continues to study public company reporting requirements, including the frequency of reporting." The topic also has caught Congress’ attention. In July, the House included a proposal in its JOBS Act 3.0 bill that would require the SEC to study the costs and benefits of the current quarterly reporting system as well as the specific requirements of Form 10-Q. That bill awaits Senate consideration. Any SEC study of this issue is expected to be rigorous and unavoidably time consuming. As such, ultimate adoption of any recommended legislative or regulatory changes will depend on who is in the Congress and/or White House at the time. At the PCAOB, the Board also recently released a draft of its five-year strategic plan, for the first time inviting public comment on its areas of strategic focus in fulfilling its mission to protect investors and the public interest through high-quality audit reports. The new Board intends to drive improvement in the quality of audit services through a combination of prevention, detection, deterrence and remediation, as well as ensure that its inspections and standard-setting activities are responsive to and do not impede technological innovations, among others. Comments for the strategic plan are due in mid-September. Will the good times last? Can they? Any change in majority control of either chamber of Congress is likely to result in further legislative gridlock. A Democratic House majority will likely lead to oversight hearings, investigations, and possibly the introduction and consideration of articles of impeachment, furthering an already toxic partisan environment. The ultimate resolution of the Mueller investigation will likely have significant impact as well. Additionally, an all-out trade war with China has the potential to shake investor confidence in the markets. Although the last year and seven months have shown just how flexible and resilient the markets can be under a healthy US economy and business-friendly political environment, the question remains whether that resiliency can continue with so much uncertainty looming in the months ahead.

It’s something we’ve all experienced, sometimes multiple times a day: You enter your credit card number online to buy something and wonder, “How can I trust that my information is safe?” That’s where Armando Colbourne and PwC’s Cybersecurity and Privacy practice (part of our Risk &amp; Regulatory platform) come in. They’re delivering on our purpose by working with clients to address new and evolving security threats -- helping them build trust in a digital, data-driven world. Here’s more from Armando. Tell us a little bit about your background and your current role at PwC. In my role, I perform privacy and/or security audits (as a third-party assessor) for companies who have either received an order from the Federal Trade Commission or Office of Civil Rights, or are working on their own to better protect the sensitive data they receive from their customers. What role does trust play in your work? Trust is absolutely the most important thing for our clients, and our clients’ clients. Clients have trust in us. I see our job as transitioning this trust to their clients, which tend to be “everyday” people who are giving over sensitive information, such as their credit card number, in exchange for some product or benefit. They wouldn’t do that unless they felt implicitly that their information was safe, and that sense of safety is what we work with our clients to provide. For example, a client I worked with in Australia was a government entity who had a large breach where minors' data was leaked. When PwC came in, the client trusted our team to solve the problem. They knew that we weren’t just in it to make money and push generic work that wasn’t tailored to fit their needs, but that we would be diligent in creating the right solution for them. In what ways do you find meaning -- and purpose -- in your work? What aspect of your work energizes you the most? I love finding ways to do things more quickly and effectively. For example, writing a code or a script that can get something done in an hour and eliminate a lot of extra manual work. For me, it’s incredibly satisfying to solve problems by coming up with new ways of getting things done that are faster and more efficient. Who do you see this aspect of your work ultimately impacting? I see my work impacting my internal team first and foremost -- I like making people’s jobs easier by finding ways to get things done quicker. And then this ultimately impacts the clients because deadlines are met and things are progressing smoothly. We all have relationships with clients and coworkers where we’re building trust in ways we may not even realize -- whether you’re helping online shoppers feel safe, ensuring the integrity of financial systems or being the first people our clients turn to in times of crisis. How does our purpose resonate with you? Share your stories with us! To learn more about purpose at PwC, visit our Purpose Spark page. .

Say something See something? Say something Tim Ryan Feb. 5, 2019 Team, As a purpose-led, values-driven firm, we act with integrity every day -- it’s what we do. While I hope none of you has to face difficult or uncomfortable situations here at PwC, I also know that we’re working in a complex environment and no organization is perfect. That’s why I want to remind you that if it does happen, it’s important to speak up. If you’re concerned about a client matter, firm policy or a situation that makes you uncomfortable -- please talk to your coach, partner leader, Relationship Partner, the One Firm Risk Organization or the People Team (HR). You can also report your concerns to the Ethics HelpLine, anonymously if you prefer. Whether you have a concern about questionable time reporting (“eating time”), suspected misuse of client or PwC data, antitrust law questions, possible sexual harassment or another matter, the firm is here to help with the right policies and resources. Your concerns will be taken seriously and handled confidentially. Many of us have completed the Pressures &amp; Demands course -- and it’s now required for all of our people via My Compliance Dashboard. The training is important and the message is simple: We are a firm where the expectation is that everyone treats each other with respect -- and when we see a situation that isn’t right, we speak up. Tim Ryan Understanding what’s expected To refresh your memory on the firm's expectations that we report our concerns, take a look at PwC’s Code of Conduct and the Reporting Concerns policy in Our Standards. And if you haven’t completed your Pressures &amp; Demands training, make sure you take the course, available on My Compliance Dashboard now.

Tax June 5, 2019 Any act of recognition, big or small, has the power to make someone’s day. Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” When it comes to ways to say “thanks,” the Northeast Asset Wealth Management team knows recognition can be powerful when it’s staring you in the face — including on your desk! Here are three innovative ways they’re embracing recognition: Traveling trophies: The group has four trophies they pass among each other in recognition of our values. So whether it’s taking the extra step for a team member, going above-and-beyond for a client, or just kindness that makes someone’s day better, trophies are handed off and proudly displayed in recognition of good work. Gratitude boards: Set on easels by the kitchen spaces, the team uses gratitude boards as a place to publicly leave notes of encouragement and thanks. What a great way to serve additional smiles on your coffee break! Leader lunches: Those who are nominated as high-impact individuals for making meaningful contributions to their teams and the firm will be invited to attend a one-on-one AWM leadership lunch. Pictured from the left: Christine Murphy, Erynne Landry, Cory Chin being handed off the trophy by Haley Evans Looking for more ideas on how to approach recognition? Check out this recent article with 3 tips from Tax. Now: whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

Plus, The habit Tell us: Have you committed a Random Act of Kindness? Plus, The habit refresher People Team Jan. 17, 2019 When we invest in our well-being, we’re better and more energized at work and at home. So as we head into the holidays and the firmwide shutdown, do something kind for someone external to PwC and spend a few minutes with your team to refresh your well-being plans you made last year during the Habit Challenge. If you’re with a different team this year, start the conversation and make a plan. 50,000 Random Acts of Kindness Today, we continue our FY19 well-being journey together with the second of four firmwide Be well, work well events this year -- 50,000 Random Acts of Kindness. Did you know? Even the smallest acts of kindness can make a difference and release an enormous chain of positivity. When a person sees another person act with kindness, generosity and gratitude, they’re much more likely to engage in that behavior themselves. In other words, acts of kindness are literally contagious! How to participate Extend a random act of kindness to someone outside of PwC — with clients, family members, friends or strangers. Our goal is to extend as many random acts of kindness as we can. Note: We will be getting some external exposure with a short ad airing during the weeks of 12/24 and 12/31 on CNBC. Log your random act(s) of kindness and location anonymously at sharekindness.pwc.com to help us track our collective reach. Continue the kindness chain by encouraging your recipient to pay it forward and log the act (if they have the ability to do so) on sharekindness.pwc.com and ask recipients of their act of kindness to do the same, and so on. Share your activity on social media using #bewellworkwell and #bekind. (See our social media guidelines.) Need a reminder? Visit Virgin Pulse and add “Be Kind” to your daily habit tracker. We hope to keep the kindness chain going by encouraging all recipients — as they pass on the act of kindness and log it — to create a ripple effect that crosses borders and transcends oceans. Refresh your team well-being plan, get Well-Being Reward points and prizes, too! It’s been a year since we launched our first firmwide habit challenge as part of our Be well, work well effort. Now it’s time to recommit to your well-being through The habit refresher. Connect with your team, check out the Habit Bank for ideas and acknowledge that you are part of a team (25 max) plan. Here’s what you need to know to get recognized for committing to two habits and sharing your story: Earn 800 points in Virgin Pulse for acknowledging you are part of a team plan (form now closed) between Dec. 18 - Jan. 13. Points will be credited in January. Teams choose two habits and register their plan before Jan. 14. You are encouraged to commit to at least one habit in the mental dimension, as that’s the area we struggle with the most as a firm, according to the Energy Audit. For example, habits can be to meditate, step away from the screen and take a walk, do the most important thing first in the day, or snooze your Chat notifications. Teams will share their team’s experience via a Google form between April 12 and April 22. Teams can keep each other accountable by leveraging Virgin Pulse’s Healthy Habit Challenge Tracker. Prizes will be awarded: Three random drawings with five winning teams in each drawing Select teams (one from each LoS) who share the most impactful experiences win $10K Top 3 social media “well-fluencers” (teams active on social media) win $7.5K. Post your well-being journey using #bewellworkwell and #teampwc (see our social media guidance) What else? Earn an extra 250 points in Virgin Pulse by taking the Energy Audit to see how your energy compares to this time last year. Visit Be well, work well site for more details on 50,000 Random Acts of Kindness and The habit refresher. Need some inspiration for an act of kindness? Here’s how one partner led by example and inspired another Recently, Partners Joe Killian (driver) and B.J. Agugliara were on the way to the New York office. While stopped at a traffic light, a homeless woman approached the car and tapped on the window startling them both. B.J. encouraged Joe to roll down the window. A bit hesitant and unsure where this would lead, Joe obliged and B.J. engaged the woman in dialogue. B.J. then reached behind him and pulled out a lunch bag, which contained a sandwich, juice and snacks and gave it to the woman. B.J. promised to keep her in his thoughts and the woman, Michelle, was very grateful for his kind gestures. “After I saw B.J. demonstrate that act of kindness to a stranger, I was changed forever,” Joe said. “I never knew that B.J., at the behest of his kids, often carried an extra lunch bag to work and would give it to the first homeless person he saw after connecting with them a bit.” Ready to spread kindness? Let’s all join in and do an act of kindness to brighten someone else’s day and inspire them to be kind to others. As an added bonus, you’ll brighten up your own day by doing so!

From the point of order, to the production line, to the job site, it was time-consuming and costly to manage the process and meet compliance requirements. We made an invisible technology personal and real for each client user. We created a Magic Moment... In collaboration with our Shanghai Service Delivery Center, we built a blockchain-based prototype that provided a single workflow. We demonstrated the human benefit of what’s often considered a complex technology by making it real for each user in the process. We created “day-in-the-life” simulations to demonstrate how each person involved would benefit in their respective jobs. The blockchain solution enabled greater transparency and less risk for the business. The solution and value we brought Blockchain, Emerging Tech and UX specialists demonstrated how blockchain can transform the supply chain — the number-one use case that execs in our new survey see for blockchain’s application to business. Our Hyperledger-based solution provides an unchangeable, near real-time record for each asset as it moves from point A to point B. Simplifying and streamlining the asset tracking process increases transparency and reduces operational friction. It also provides a trusted record of transactions and inspections to meet regulatory requirements and reduce risk. Have a recent win through BXT? Reach out to Lina Woods or US_digital@pwc.com.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between April 1, 2018, and June 30, 2018, you should contact Nick Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

You’ve been watching the news and know that the US government has recently imposed economic sanctions on Venezuelan entities and individuals. A few questions come to mind. Is this potential engagement impacted by these sanctions? If so, what does it mean for your engagement? You need answers, but who can help? Ethics &amp; Compliance can help. As detailed in the FY19 Independence, Ethics and Compliance training, certain higher-risk countries may require additional scrutiny, such as Venezuela and Russia. Additionally, a few countries including Cuba, Iran and North Korea remain subject to comprehensive economic sanctions. Check this guidance and up-to-date listing to review the embargoed and higher-risk countries. If you haven’t completed your annual training requirement, go to My Compliance Dashboard and complete it today. Be aware of your responsibilities, and consult. A breach of US sanctions rules -- even if inadvertent -- can have serious consequences for you and the firm, potentially resulting in civil and criminal penalties. Consultations with Government E&amp;C and appropriate risk management teams are required before engaging in any transaction involving an embargoed country or a country that presents a higher sanctions risk. Please make sure you review our PwC US Sanctions Policy to understand your compliance and reporting responsibilities.

With the recent transition to Workday, a few changes were made to how you’ll need to document your credentials. Here’s what you need to know: You’re responsible for submitting and maintaining your credentials or credential exam results directly in the appropriate system of record, based on whether the licenses and credentials are CPA or non-CPA. For non-CPA credentials and all credential exams, including CPA exams, you’ll now document directly in Workday, which replaces the Talent Development database previously maintained by the People Team. Here’s how to document credentials in Workday going forward. For CPA licenses, CPA work plans and foreign accounting credentials (collectively “CPA Licenses”), you’ll continue to document using the Credential Tracking System (CTS). If you submit your CPA Licenses into Workday, the transaction will be denied by the HRSSC Operations team. To avoid this, please make sure you submit your CPA Licenses to CTS directly. If you are working towards your primary credential exam and eligible for promotion, refer to the 2018 primary credential exam deadlines here.

But you might be surprised when our new system requires compliance by asking for more details than in the past. First, make sure you know the basics. Watch SAP Concur’s three-minute video tutorial on hotel itemization: Expense system pro tips: Speed up hotel itemization Don’t want to enter the details manually? There are three ways to get our new system to auto-fill the info for you! Activate e-receipts and our system will automatically pull the hotel itemizations directly from the hotel vendor’s system. Another option: Tap the ExpenseIt icon in the SAP Concur Expense app on your phone, and upload a picture of your receipt to add it to your report. Or: Take a picture of your hotel folio and email it to receipts@expenseit.com. The system will provide your itemization. More to know Want more pro tips?

Andres Rodriguez, a manager in US IT, based in the Tampa office, lives -- and loves -- to pay it forward. "I enjoy helping people grow and expand in ways they did not think possible," he said. Paying it forward includes driving messages related to health and fitness -- but topping the list is mentoring kids. Why does he do it? "Because I was that kid,” he explained. “I would have appreciated more chances growing up. I was in awe of key influencers in the world -- and dreamed of opportunities that seemed out of my reach." Knowing what it's like to want a better life, Andres helps today’s youth by teaching financial literacy through Access Your PotentialⓇ and PwC’s involvement with Junior Achievement, a program for students from pre-K through high school where volunteers provide onsite mentoring and teaching. “I don't think I've missed one Junior Achievement volunteer event in the five years I've been with the firm; I want to inspire kids to follow their dreams," he said. He gives back at work, too, whether it's sharing his passion for yoga, tips on living a healthy and mindful life, or just being aware of how we can all help each other in simple ways. A recent trip to the cafeteria even provided an opportunity. "I overheard someone say they thought yoga was difficult and overwhelming,” he said. “I jumped at the chance to share some tips on how yoga, and meditation, helped me on my wellness journey." And when it comes to Be well, work well, that journey even includes providing yoga demonstrations to teams in his office, teaching the basics and how even just a few seconds of collective breathing can help everyone relax in a meeting. "Teams can do this together to find the calm in a situation, then reset and move forward," he said. His interest in others goes deep, and global. Growing up, he lived in 15 different cities throughout the US, as well as Venezuela and Mexico. "I was fortunate to be exposed to diverse cultures, which helped shape my global acumen and ingrained a deeper understanding of others' perspectives, so I can better understand where a person is coming from.” Rest assured, this is all coming from a humble place; Andres emphasizes that we're all a work in progress. "The bottom line is, I try and improve myself on a daily basis -- from within and with the help of others," he said. “When we're in a position to help others grow, whether mentoring or sharing our gifts in other ways, we can all make a difference in an extraordinary way."

Yes, you can attend a Digital Academy session in either your home market, or the market where your client is located. The firm will not reimburse expenses related to traveling to any other market for this training. However, you may expense one night of a hotel stay, and associated meals, if you are attending in the market where your client is located. Please use the following code: 80127251001 (Note: this code may only be used if accompanied by a note from your Relationship Leader or Engagement Partner to US_Digital-Academy@pwc.com approving the expense). I have added my name to a waitlist, how will I be contacted if I am allowed in the course? If a learner is moved from the waitlist to an active registration, they will receive a message from Vantage confirming their new enrollment. Please note that if you are on a waitlist, you can attempt to join the session as a walk-in. We have recently experienced last minute cancellations and no shows the day of training, which is too late to move someone off the waitlist. If you want to try attending as a walk-in, you will need to download the pre-work (install software and download data files) found in Vantage. Attendance is recorded by submitting the attend code provided at the session. What should I do if none of the sessions in my market work for my client schedule? Please also look at the list of sessions in your client’s market if you are unable to find a session in your home market that works for you. If I have registered for a session after March 31, do I need to change that? Yes, our ask is that you drop that session and instead register for a session or a waitlist prior to March 31. How do I change my registration for a class if I need to move to another date? Click here to learn how to manage your enrollment. If I can no longer attend the session I’m registered for, but I can’t find another open session that works for my schedule, should I drop the registration and join a waitlisted session?Yes, you must withdraw from your current registration to enroll for a waitlist on a different date. Click here to manage your enrollment. Please note that given the investment we are making in this course, and given the limited availability of seats, not showing up for a course that you have registered for will result in a note to your Relationship Leader and Coach. How do I un-enroll if I am waitlisted for one session and want to enroll in another? You can only register/be on a waitlist for one session at a time. You'll need to withdraw from your current waitlist spot to enroll for another session. Click here to learn how to manage your enrollment. Are Partners required to complete a Digital Academy session by March 31? No, only associates through MDs are required to complete a Digital Academy session by March 31. Partners are encouraged to do so as well, providing it works for their schedule. I attended a Data Analytics Academy or Forensics Analytics for Everyone course - will this be counted as completing a Digital Academy course? For those who have already taken the Data &amp; Analytics Academy training (or equivalent programs in Deals and Forensics), you do not have to take the Digital Academy. But, please register for a Digital Lab Immersion training, so that you can get the additional piece of this curriculum that was not covered previously. Can I complete a Digital Academy session online instead of in person? At this time, we do not have a virtual Digital Academy option that is CPE-eligible and trackable. We expect to be able to offer this option by the beginning of March. Please note that there will still be a significant time investment needed to complete Digital Academy online. So, our recommendation would be for you to sign up for an in-person session now and then once the virtual option becomes available, you can evaluate whether that would better fit your schedule.

PwC’s standard contract provisions are incorporated in the Tax engagement letter templates found on the electronic tool "CREATE for Tax", which have been approved by One Firm Risk Organization (“OFRO”) Tax and Office of General Counsel (“OGC”). Standard key contract provisions are regularly updated to comply with changes in Firm policy or changes in tax law, regulations and ethical or professional standards. Accordingly, it is important to retrieve the electronic templates when drafting the engagement contract to ensure you are engaging your client under the most recent terms and conditions. Any modifications to the standard terms and conditions in the engagement letter, including changes to the terms and conditions in a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”), will require the approval of OFRO Tax as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process. To obtain approval, mark “Yes” to question 2.1 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment and answer the questions that follow appropriately, providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Question 2.1 Terms &amp; Conditions Changes Are you using a previously negotiated Engagement Letter or MSA that contains nonstandard terms (other than for terms expressly allowed at the engagement partner's discretion pursuant to Contract Guidance for Engagement Teams)? OR Has the Client requested changes to standard Terms &amp; Conditions? OR Does the client have a separate Confidentiality Agreement that does not conform to PwC Policy? Yes No Each Engagement Letter or Statement of Work (“SOW”) issued under a MSA that contains nonstandard and/or changes to terms and conditions will require OFRO Tax approval each time on the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment as part of the engagement set-up process. That is, even if you have received approval from OFRO Tax, Contracting Center of Excellence ("CCoE”) and/or OGC in the past for the term modifications (separately or in a previous Engagement Acceptance Assessment), each engagement stands on its own and requires OFRO Tax approval. Thus, mark this question “Yes”. Certain provisions in our engagement letters (e.g., Scope of Our Services, Client Responsibilities, etc.) may be modified by engagement teams based on the specific client circumstances without further consultation or approval. A good reference for Tax engagement teams is the Contract Guidance for the Tax Engagement Letters which provides guidance for evaluating proposed revisions or exceptions to our standard terms and conditions. It includes guidelines regarding what may be changed, what approvals are required, and provides suggested responses to frequently asked questions. For additional information regarding modifications to engagement letter templates and standard terms and conditions, see the Engagement Terms: Requests for Modifications policy. Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

We’re taking the July 4 week off — AND announcing Learn2earn! Tim Ryan Jan. 7, 2019 Start planning! We’re taking the July 4 week off — AND announcing Learn2earn ... read more below! Team, Last year we asked all of you to double down on your efforts toward Your Tomorrow, and in exchange we closed down the firm for a week in July. You told us you loved having the time off, so we’re going to do it again — with a twist. We’re announcing now that we’ll take the July 4 week off to rest, relax and get ready for the next leg in our journey to become a digital firm. So, what’s the catch? There isn’t one! You told us last year that the only thing that could make the break even better was more time to plan. We’re letting you know now so you can start thinking about how you’ll spend the time. To add to the fun — and help us achieve our goal of having everyone complete all four Digital Quests and earn their Digital Acumen knowledge badges by June 30 — we’re also announcing “Learn2earn.” Join us as we all lean into Your Tomorrow, help add value to our clients, upskill ourselves — and win some money along the way! Here’s what you need to do: Complete all four Digital Quests by April 30 (Note: Our goal as a firm is still to complete these quests and earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30 ... but we’re adding an incentive to beat the last-minute dash to the end!) Earn 150 points by April 30 as an active member of the Digital Lab community, by contributing to and/or using the resources of Digital Lab. Everyone who successfully completes the challenge will be entered into a raffle for up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win (you can read the contest rules here)! It’s our way of saying thank you for going the extra mile on our Your Tomorrow journey. Team, I hope you’re excited — because I am. July 4 will be here before we know it, and by then we’ll have new skills and a more digital firm. And in the spirit of Be well, work well, we’ll be ready to take a break so we stay charged up and ready for even more growth and opportunities! Map out your game plan to Learn2earn We’ve set an important goal for everyone to complete all four Digital Quests to earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30 — and that hasn’t changed. However, we know you like a challenge, and if you want to lead on this important goal, you could be a winner! Everyone who completes the four Digital Quests and earns 150 points in Digital Lab by April 30 will be entered into a raffle to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win! The first two Digital Quests are now available, and the next two will be unlocked in March. Each Digital Quest takes about an hour — plus the time you spend interacting with our Digital Upskilling learning channels to build your digital skills, like PowerUp!, Learning Bursts and Tech While You Trek. And you’ll not only be putting yourself into the running for great prizes, you’ll be investing in yourself and building the knowledge you need as our firm digitizes. You’ll find all the resources you need in the Digital Hub. Contribute ... consume ... and win with Digital Lab Did you know that you can win points that translate into cash rewards by contributing assets and consuming content on Digital Lab? Whether you create a bot in UiPath, download an Alteryx workflow or rate and comment on your favorite data visualization in Tableau, you’re earning points using our Gateway to Your Tomorrow. With Learn2earn, there’s even more reason to start using Digital Lab. If you earn 150 points using our technology-sharing community by the challenge deadline of April 30, as well as complete all four Digital Quests, you’ll be entered to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition. For example, you can earn 10 points simply by submitting a review and rating for an automation. Later this month, you will have the ability to see how many points you’ve earned in Digital Lab and see guidance on the many other ways you can earn points in PwC Inside. And don't worry, any points you've already earned since November 13 will be counted towards your 150-point goal. So, continue to use Digital Lab on your client engagements as well as to make administrative tasks easier, and you’ll be well on your way to completing this part of the Learn2earn challenge! Get ready, get set … start planning! We’re confirming now that the US firm will shut down for the week of July 4. To help you plan, here’s the FY20 US holiday schedule. For the July 4 holiday shutdown, we’ll apply a "give two/take two" approach. That is, the firm will give two additional days, and we ask that staff take two vacation days or floating holidays in addition to the July 4 federal holiday.

Survey says... How can family businesses succeed? Survey says... Private Company Services May 25, 2018 What does it take to succeed as a family business? Since 2002, PwC has been posing questions to family businesses across the globe to find out what factors affect their companies and what they think they will need to do to be successful now and in the future. Past results of the PwC Family Business Survey, now in its 15th year, have been quite revealing. "Over the years, the survey results have helped us understand what family businesses are focused on — from innovation to globalization to just making it past the second generation,” says Jonathan Flack, US Family Business Services Leader for PwC. “It also highlights what may be blindspots for them like updating their business strategy or addressing succession planning.” The 2018 PwC Family Business Survey just launched and will be collecting data from PwC clients and prospects through June 30th. By reaching out to more than 2,500 family business owners in 40 countries across the globe, PwC aims to glean comprehensive insights that will help our clients and prospects learn more about what family businesses are thinking and doing — and allow PwC to uncover ways to help these companies address their strategy, planning, and governance questions and issues. What does your family business client or prospect think? Share the survey! Know a family business client or prospect whose perspective would be a valuable contribution to the survey results? Invite them to participate in the online survey. The deadline for responses is June 30th (all responses are anonymous) with results scheduled to be shared in November. Bridging the gap: Last year’s PwC Family Business Survey revealed a strategy gap between prioritizing long-term future growth and innovation which highlighted the importance of medium term strategic planning to bridge the two.

That’s something we can never take for granted — we’ve seen how quickly businesses can lose trust and how hard it is to rebuild. By consistently living our values every day, each of us has the opportunity to go to bed each night knowing we protected and enhanced our brand. One of the ways we protect our brand is to have a group of people — our Ethics &amp; Compliance team — who spend their time thinking about continuous improvement and how we keep getting better. As a purpose-led, values-driven firm, we do business the right way. Because of this, we’re able to attract and retain great talent, deliver outstanding services to our clients and sustain our trusted brand. Our E&amp;C team helps us enhance this strong culture by providing us with clear guidelines and training on what is expected of each of us, and by supporting us when issues arise. Our E&amp;C team is a talented group of 125 partners and staff from our own lines of service, competitors, Fortune 500 companies and other industries. They are subject matter specialists with extensive backgrounds in areas such as personal independence, ethics and business conduct, investigations and information protection, as well as trade, political and regulatory compliance, among many others. We are not a perfect organization — but we have a lot to be proud of. I recently met with Jude Curtis, who has led Ethics &amp; Compliance for 15 years. Jude will retire in June, so we’ve been having discussions with Jude and Hillary Stanley, Jude’s successor, about how we build on our strengths as a firm and keep improving. We strive to be a firm where people feel they can speak up. This matters because every organization has issues — and we’ve seen stories in the press of what happens when people don’t speak up when they have a concern. We benchmark against other organizations. Based on the data and how we compare to similar organizations, we believe people have confidence they can come forward and be heard. We don’t tolerate retaliation at our firm. We want everyone at PwC to feel safe when speaking up, and we believe most of our people do. A key indicator of how safe people feel when speaking up is whether they choose to remain anonymous when making a call to our HelpLine. While reporting a concern anonymously is always an option, at PwC we have the lowest rate of anonymous reports, by far, of any organization we are aware of. So why is this important? If things are going as they should at PwC, then our annual training, discussions about values and articles in PwC Inside about speaking up may seem like routine administrative activities. But if an issue comes up, that’s when it matters. We want every person who works here to know that PwC is a place where we expect to be treated with respect, can safely speak up if we have a concern, and have very strong and successful processes for providing support. To give you more insight into how we address issues at PwC, we spoke with Jude and Hillary about some of the questions you might wonder about — from what it means to be anonymous to who investigates issues at PwC. And while we appreciate all that Ethics &amp; Compliance does for our firm, we’re all part of building and sustaining a respectful work environment at PwC. If there are situations happening that don’t reflect our values, it’s up to each of us to speak up. If you have questions or need support, you can always consult with the Ethics HelpLine.

Assurance Oct. 18, 2018 In Assurance, our One Firm strategy is how we’re enhancing the quality and value of our core services. We can leverage resources, like the Centers of Excellence (CoE), to standardize, simplify and automate specific tasks that will enhance quality and provide development opportunities for our staff and teams. The Exelon team’s work with the Cash FSLI CoE during the 2018 audit is a great example. After re-allocating portions of the work to the CoE, Senior Associates Carly Turner and Nolan Jones were able to work on a new project that gave them unique audit-relevant experience. They advised and assisted a non-audit client as they prepared and filed a “rate case” -- an extensive process through which utilities justify to regulators the rates they’ll charge customers in coming years. It’s central to our understanding of their business, and a significant area of focus in our audits. “On this project, I was able to assist our non-audit client in areas ranging from assessing forecasts and related calculations to strategizing and evaluating supporting testimony. By working with specialists on this project, I gained a much deeper understanding of the industry, the complexity of rate cases and how they fit into the company’s overall business operations” said Carly. “And now I’m able to bring that knowledge back to my work at audit clients.” Overall, the experience enhanced our skills, developed internal and external professional relationships. It also enhanced our understanding of the “One Firm” approach to our audit and non-audit projects, including our focus on quality and relevance. Even more importantly, it provided Carly and Nolan with new skills that are valuable to their audits and will be throughout their careers. “I worked closely with the accounting and legal departments on a rate case focused on gas. This year I’ll be testing gas rates on my audit client, so now I can take everything I learned and bring it to my audit work. It’s all extremely relevant, and honestly it’s helped me grow into an even more well-rounded auditor and professional,” said Nolan.

We’re conferring with Dell and HP about this issue. In the meantime, check the seams around your laptop, especially just below the touchpad. If the laptop appears distended, or if the case separates as you see below, power down and take it to Office Technology Support as soon as possible. To help avoid this issue, the manufacturers suggest you periodically unplug your laptop and let the battery drain to 20 percent capacity or less.

Associate Krista Moller is a prime example of how we bring this strategy to life with flexibility. Last year, when Krista launched her career at PwC, she hoped it wouldn’t put an end to her singing pursuits. In addition to being an auditor, she sings a capella in a barbershop quartet, C’est La Vie, which recently placed 20th at the Sweet Adelines international competition. Krista’s quartet rehearses regularly and travels to various competitions around the world. “I’ve been singing since I was 9 years old,” Krista said. “I can’t imagine living a fulfilling life without singing. That’s why flexibility played a major role in my decision to join PwC. I’m thankful that the firm is committed to its people and encourages us to bring our best selves to work. I’m able to do that with singing.” While interviewing for her job at PwC, Krista met hiring manager Tina Raether and decided to invite her to a fundraiser for her quartet. To Krista’s pleasant surprise, Tina attended the event with her entire family. It was at that moment, Krista knew PwC would be the place for her. Today Krista credits her colleagues for contributing to her success outside the office. “My team has been supportive of my singing from day one,” she said. “During busy season, our team chooses one night per week to leave early. To accommodate my rehearsal schedule, which isn’t flexible, the team encouraged me to select Tuesday nights.” Krista is grateful to her team for providing the flexibility she needs to pursue her passion for singing. The experience has improved her work productivity and has also helped form a stronger bond with colleagues. “Singing is so meaningful to me,” she said. “To be able to share it with my peers has helped grow our relationships. It’s also improved my time-management skills between client obligations, office activities, training and my singing hobby.” In April 2019, Krista’s barbershop quartet will compete in an international qualifying event in Phoenix. From there she hopes to go to New Orleans for the next international competition. We wish her all the best! #PwCProud Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know.

As you review the following principles, consider their application in light of the type of Tax services you provide and engagements you work on. Proper application of the data security principles will not only reduce the firm's risk of data loss but may also reduce hours in the engagement and hours in your workday. Collect and use only the minimum amount of information necessary for your work If you don't need it, don’t collect it. If the client provides information outside the parameters of your request, return it to the client in a secure manner. Do not add hours to your day and the engagement maintaining data you do not need. Share information with others only as needed Apply the concept of "need to know" and manage access to electronic information (e.g., DMS) in the same manner. Not everyone on the engagement team needs the same level of access. Encrypt all confidential information in external emails and on data storage devices Determine the most secure method to exchange confidential information between PwC and external parties. Encrypt documents sent via email, on USB flash drives, CDs or other data storage devices. Secure information and devices when not in use Protect client information whether in hard copy, or on laptops, mobile devices (i.e., iPhones, iPads, or other cellular devices) or data storage devices. Lock up confidential information and devices when not in active use. Do not leave your computer unattended and in standby mode. Report stolen laptops or mobile devices immediately to US IT. Use only firm managed equipment and email accounts for work related matters Only use personal devices with the firm’s approved secure connectivity software installed to access client and non-public firm information. Do not use home PCs, personal email or instant message accounts, or other nonapproved technologies to access client and non-public firm information. Be aware of how your physical surroundings can put information at risk Secure confidential information by locking file cabinets, promptly picking up printouts or faxes, and by not discussing confidential matters in open spaces. Do not let individuals without proper ID into PwC offices and work spaces. Securely destroy or return information that is no longer needed Do not retain unnecessary information - electronically or in hard copy. Promptly return hard copy files to the Records Center when no longer needed. Return or properly destroy what is not part of your work papers. Retain all information in accordance with firm policies and other requirements. Questions?

I filled his tank and gave him the coat I was wearing.” “My children and I prepared envelopes with money in them and secretly placed them around bus stops and the train station to help those who find it pay their fare.” “I gave up my window seat on the plane to an excited little boy who wanted to watch the mountains go by.” Many of you also shared the experience on social media using #bekind and #bewellworkwell — an amazing example of how we can come together to showcase the firm’s well-being culture.

Get resources to use in One Firm conversations and preview the findings below. This year’s report, titled “CEOs’ curbed confidence spells caution,” finds global and US CEOs much more pessimistic about global GDP growth in 2019 compared to a year ago (though US CEOs remain an optimistic group in general on the prospects for growth for their own organizations this year). The report explores CEO strategies for transforming their organizations to be positioned for growth, securing the talent they need for the future, and preparing to leverage artificial intelligence and data to create more value. Findings are based on the views of nearly 1,400 CEOs in more than 90 countries (including more than 100 US CEOs), surveyed in September and October of 2018.

Sign up for Social Central (now powered by the Dynamic Signal platform) to share approved messages in one click and help spread the word with your networks. What’s on CEOs’ minds Highlights of the survey findings are below; you’ll see that many of the themes tie directly to our platforms -- Cybersecurity, Deals, Fit for Growth, Managed Services, Risk &amp; Regulatory and Workforce of the Future. Access the report at www.pwc.com/us/ceosurvey. Here are three main takeaways: Reality check: Last year, we saw a record jump in CEO optimism for global growth prospects. In contrast, this year we saw a record jump in pessimism, with nearly 30% of CEOs projecting a decline in global economic growth, up from just 5% a year ago. To be clear, CEOs still project positive global growth, but if their past predictive power is any indication, the pace will slow down in 2019. Look inside-out for growth: Global CEOs are adapting to the populist sentiment sweeping the globe. The threats they consider most pressing are less existential (such as terrorism or climate change), and more related to the ease of doing business in the markets where they operate, including over-regulation, policy uncertainty, availability of key skills, and trade conflicts. Mind the information and skills gaps: CEOs are working to bridge the gaps in their own capabilities. Organizations are struggling to translate a deluge of data into better decision making. There is a shortage of skilled talent to clean, integrate and extract value from big data. Despite investments of billions of dollars, a gap remains between the data CEOs need and what they get. This gap, a priority for the C Suite, has not closed in 10 years. Check out these additional resources: Tim Ryan is in Davos sharing updates on Twitter and LinkedIn. He shared a blog giving his thoughts on how business can still grow as CEOs become more cautious. Our internal CEO Survey - Global site will be refreshed as new materials are released this week and in the coming months, including sector reports. Survey results will continue to inform the PwC points of view we’re driving in the market, including the recently released AI Predictions, Top Policy Trends and an upcoming campaign focusing on how PwC can help clients achieve benefits from the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Brad Blanchard, a Director in Analytic Insights. I’m based in Dallas and have been with the firm for three years. What's a typical day for you? In my role as a data scientist, I help our line of service teams make better decisions about which clients to target, and why. I spend a lot of time analyzing data, writing code and developing interesting stories based on data. We help our colleagues see that data is more than numbers on a page; it’s something you can actually visualize and relate to when making day-to-day decisions. How did your journey lead you to this role? I became intrigued with how companies, and leaders, make decisions when I was an operational analyst at Fossil. The data science movement was hot, and after getting my Masters in Business Analytics, I took a role at a custom clothing company to help them learn from data. We built algorithms to match body shapes on their website so customers could find the perfect fit. That sealed the deal for me to become a data scientist. I was happy to bring this knowledge to PwC to help energize our leaders about scientifically understanding our clients to further enhance the quality and value we deliver and, where appropriate, improve the experience for our clients by anticipating what they need. How does your team bring quality and value to PwC? Believe it or not, we think of ourselves as creative problem solvers -- and storytellers! We look at data, pull out the facts and decision points, and use them to drive quality and deliver insights for leaders. We love to use data to tell stories that help PwC target clients and devise tailored solutions, all based on scientific analysis. For example, we came up with a way to figure out which companies might be likely to leave their existing auditors over the course of a year, and why. And we’ve built a predictive model that helps us see which companies might launch an IPO, or be receptive to a proposal. These findings really help our firm leaders be proactive and stay ahead of the market! What might we be surprised to learn about you? My wife and I have seven children, all under the age of 10 -- so that keeps us busy. My breakfast specialty involves 16 eggs! We really enjoy volunteering in our community and helped establish a nonprofit to serve refugees who fled Baghdad. We even moved into the apartment complex where the refugees were housed to be able to help them as much as possible. It was a great growth experience for the whole family. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

The sessions are scheduled for June 7, 10 and 17. There will be separate live webcasts for associates and senior associates — you can register to attend in Vantage. This distinct development opportunity will help expand your perspectives on diversity, explore the importance of inclusion as a leadership skill, and examine and commit to strategies that foster our inclusive culture. These skills are important to your growth and development — we expect each of you will make attendance a priority. Our Inclusive Leadership and Belonging sessions are another example of how we’re standing with other leading businesses to foster more inclusive workplaces and communities as part of CEO Action for Diversity &amp; InclusionTM . The 650+ signatories will join us in commemorating the two-year anniversary of CEO Action by engaging in candid conversations with their people about diversity and inclusion. Take action for Inclusive Leadership and Belonging: If you are an associate or senior associate, sign up for a session in Vantage. If you are a manager through partner and are interested in hearing what our associates and seniors are learning, you can register to attend one or both sessions in Vantage. Talk to your clients about CEO Action and take the I Act On pledge to commit to check your biases, speak up for others and show up for all. Join one of our Inclusion Networks to connect with and learn from your colleagues. Our Inclusion Networks are for everyone (members, allies, learners and supporters). Take the HeForShe pledge to stand up for gender equity. Planning to view the Inclusive Leadership Webcast as a group? A few things you need to know. Attend the session for your staff level, especially senior associates; a senior associate must attend a senior associate session to be marked complete. In a group viewing situation, in order to be marked as attended/completed you need to follow these instructions: All staff need to register in Vantage.

More good news We recently achieved a 45% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to FY07 levels, a full two years ahead of our original FY20 target. Considering our firm headcount increased about 61% during the same period, this is a significant achievement. Many factors contributed to the reduction -- including our ongoing shift to LEED-certified office space, increased mobility and flexible working arrangements, and innovations by our IT team in the way we manage our technology and data. This success demonstrates that investing in working smarter with less impact means we don’t have to choose between economic growth and environmental responsibility: We can have both.

Gail Friend, a Phoenix-based Administrative Support Concierge, feels like she's living a dream. "More like a fairy tale," she says. And she's not kidding. In just one year, she went from sewing crafts as a hobby to becoming a full-fledged dress designer featured in notable fashion shows. How did it happen? "In my spare time,” she explained, “I volunteer as an administrative assistant for the Arizona Apparel Foundation, a nonprofit fashion manufacturer that caters to emerging fashion designers. They held a contest for new designers and I thought it would be fun to create a gown." She won the contest, and since then has become sought after in the fashion world. That’s right -- just like that. "I can't believe it myself,” she said. “It's surreal!" Gail describes her dresses as expressions of art that take the shape and form of fashion. She never uses patterns, and cuts fabric by hand on an 80-foot table. Right now, she's busy creating eight gowns for an upcoming fashion show in September. "It's called '398.2,' because those are the Dewey Decimal numbers for the fairy tale section in the library, and my collection is based on a fairy tale theme," she said. Word is getting around Gail applied for Community Night at Phoenix Fashion Week, one of the most influential fashion shows in the southwest, and was accepted. “It’s rare for someone new to the field to be selected,” she said. “I'm humbled and grateful. People now come up to me and say they love my work and look forward to future designs." How does she find the time? "I sew at night and on weekends; it helps that I have a studio in the Arizona Apparel Foundation and can also use their sewing rooms," she said. She gives back, too, including serving on the board for Fashion Group International; other members include Betsey Johnson, Diane von Furstenberg and Tim Gunn. Gail makes sure to track her volunteer hours to take advantage of PwC's Dollars for Doers program, which allows her to further support the organization. "My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap that exists in underserved communities by helping those in need find jobs in this field." Until then, she's running to keep up with it all. "But I'm not quitting my day job," she assures us. "I love my job at PwC; not only is it the best job I've ever had, it gives me the chance to realize my dreams through flexibility and ways to give back." Update: Since this writing Gail and her photographer began The Edify Fashion Group and spent a year planning a fashion show. Gail is now working on her next collection, Jardin des Amis, French for Garden of Friends, and is currently serving as regional director and president of the board of the Fashion Group International for Arizona.

Through our leadership role in the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™, we’ll engage 1 million people over the next year and give them the chance to become more inclusive leaders. The new Check Your Blind Spots unconscious bias mobile tour debuted in New York City and I had a chance to take a tour. It was an amazing experience that I want to share with you. The video tells the story better than I can, so please take two minutes to watch. We’re taking on an issue that is critical to our future in a very different way, using video, virtual reality and other approaches. We’ll engage our clients, students on campus and our communities with a tech-enabled, gamified experience. The bus will be touring the country -- and many of us will have a chance to see it. In fact you can check out the experience in Los Angeles on December 4 and 9, and in Las Vegas on December 15. I hope you’ll check it out if you can. I think you’ll be proud to see what it’s all about. To expand our reach beyond those that attend the tour, we’ve created the “I Act On Pledge.” This is a personal pledge that anyone can take to help cultivate inclusive behaviors in our everyday lives. I want to ask you to help share this message with the people around you and make your own I Act On Pledge, which anyone can read about and take on the CEO Action website. Think about how you will personally be a more inclusive leader -- and talk about it with your team, with your clients, and with future PwCers, and invite them to join you and also take the pledge. We expect to have 1 million people take the I Act On Pledge over the next year and to reach 1 million people through the mobile unit. But imagine how much bigger the impact can be with all of us -- 50,000 strong -- talking about inclusion and sharing our commitment to keep getting better. That’s our purpose in action!

This agreement is the newest addition to PwC’s Insourced Solutions for Tax service offering (part of our Managed Services platform). Approximately 40 Aon employees will join PwC in May. Background Our xLoS account team for Aon does a great job of introducing our platforms and sharing insights from our PwC journey. All of this has resonated with Aon’s CEO, who is focused on transforming the company for the future. Mirroring our journey, the Aon team has been working on a multi-year Fit for Growth (FFG) project aimed at managing costs and creating investment capacity. Introducing IST Through the FFG process, we helped Aon identify their tax function as an area of focus -- with opportunities to address a complicated global structure and outdated technology, and also leverage top talent. We collaborated with Aon to develop a number of possible solutions including IST, which provides our clients the opportunity to in-source their tax department with PwC. Aon’s CFO and CTO decided a comprehensive operating model change was the best path to follow and evaluated several options in a highly competitive process. After extensive sessions, Aon ultimately chose our IST solution for several reasons, including: Our ability to address their need for top talent Cutting-edge tax technology to drive efficiency and value Our approach to a specialized IST practice This was a huge team effort with a large group of PwC professionals working together and leveraging multiple platforms to help Aon on their transformation journey.

Automation now: Are your clients ready to transform their business? Marketing &amp; Sales May 31, 2018 Automation has been around since the Industrial Revolution. But today, a new class of tools designed to empower business users enables business process automation in new ways. With insights from more than two dozen PwC US and Global leaders, our One Firm perspective is now available. Check it out: “Automation now.” Not sure where to start? These five questions for your client to consider will help guide your conversation around automation, while connecting to your client’s digital transformation journey: Do we understand our business processes and pain points? Are people and culture at the heart of our strategy? Will our efforts be sustainable through robust governance? How is our tech ecosystem evolving to meet our goals? Are we measuring business returns beyond financial ROI? Within technology, the new automation toolbox (see sidebar) includes a broad set of potential tools on a continuum — from the very simple to the highly complex — all of which require varying degrees of collaboration between business functions and IT. Use these resources to start the conversation with your client: Webpage: digital perspective framed around 5 questions Executive summary for printing Talking points: our One Firm talk-track on automation (internal) Sales deck with bold messaging and graphics New Automation Toolbox Social media messages + images RPA training calendar + Spark page Access additional resources via Google or Spark What’s in your automation toolbox? Automation technologies range from the simple, like an Excel macro, to complex, like intelligent process automation platforms. Combining simple and more complex automation technologies creates a multiplier effect with a bigger impact.

As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors, and IFS directors with five or more years of service, are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to disengage, recharge and truly focus on their well-being -- a key component of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Working for a purpose-led, values-driven firm and having an affinity for African wildlife inspired New York-based Director Beata DeZagon to do something radical with her sabbatical. “It’s estimated that only 25,000 rhinos remain in the world, with more than 1,000 being killed each year,” Beata said. “I decided to use my sabbatical time to volunteer at the Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary in Mpumalanga, South Africa, to learn more about the rhino crisis and conservation efforts -- and to help care for orphaned rhinos. My husband was nervous that I was traveling alone, but he supported me because he knows how much the cause meant to me.” After a 20-hour trip, Beata finally reached her destination. “Words can’t describe how I felt stepping onto the world’s largest orphaned rhino sanctuary,” she said. “There were volunteers from around the world, and the staff I met were incredibly selfless and dedicated professionals. “They work 12 days on/two days off and live four hours outside of Johannesburg. Due to strict security measures to protect from poachers, it’s extremely difficult to travel in and out of the sanctuary. So everyone who works there essentially gives up everything else in their life for these animals.” The sanctuary takes in orphaned rhinos from Kruger National Park and other game reserves after their mothers are poached. Volunteers like Beata assist staff in rehabilitating the rhinos and safely releasing them into intensive-protective zones, which are manned by armed rangers 24/7, along with electrified fencing and surveillance technology to deter poachers. “We worked hard every day to dig new drain lines, reinforce the electrified fences and clean the rhino’s bomas (enclosure),” Beata said. “We would feed the rhinos throughout the day, prepping milk and feeding the youngest rhinos around the clock, even at 2 a.m.! We also learned about the use of K9s against poachers, and did a snare-sweep exercise with the anti-poaching team. Poachers place snares in bushes to illegally trap wildlife, which is why the exercise is critical in preventing other animal species from dying. ” Back at home, Beata continues to help fundraise and promote awareness of the poaching crisis -- to help reverse the trend and ultimately prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros. Reflecting on her trip, Beata encourages colleagues to seek new experiences that help gain a sense of perspective. “Working for a global firm requires us to learn about other cultures,” she explained. “We operate in a fast-paced environment. It’s important to slow down and realize how big our world is and what’s happening around us.” Visit our Rewards Strategy site to read more about sabbaticals and learn about PwC's Career Milestone program.

A 529 savings plan might be the way to go, but if you are required to maintain personal independence, it is important to understand the restriction status of the plan and the implications for you. The firm provides audit services to many financial services clients, and as a result, many 529 plans are restricted entities. And that could mean that those plans are impermissible for you. Remember: If you are required to maintain a portfolio in Independence Checkpoint and you’re thinking about opening a 529 college savings plan, check this list of “conditionally” permitted plans first. If you are in the chain of command, you are only permitted to invest in plans found on this list. Everyone should pre-clear any plan you’re interested in, even if it is on one of PwC’s lists. When pre-clearing a plan, use the CUSIP in the lists above as many plans have similar names. And, finally: As with all restricted entities, if you’re a covered person for a plan you cannot invest in that plan, even if it is on the conditionally permitted list. If you maintain an Independence Checkpoint portfolio and already own a 529 plan that is not on one of the above lists, contact the Compliance Resource Center for guidance. Practice staff below manager level are permitted to invest in any 529 savings plan, as long as they do not provide services to the plan. Have questions or need help? The Compliance Resource Center (CRC) can answer your personal independence questions — click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option five inside the US or from outside the US call 1-813-351-6491.

The Platforms Navigator will help you identify the problems our platform teams are helping to solve, recognize key business issues, and equip you to start a conversation with your non-audit client. When you collaborate with platform teams to deliver holistic solutions that go beyond the initial ask, you deliver greater value to your non-audit clients. We’re challenging you to double down on platforms. How are our non-audit clients benefiting from platforms? The Deals platform created a project plan and roadmap to help health services client Envision effectively execute the challenging IT carve out work necessary to divest a subsidiary to private equity client KKR. The work by GEP Kelly King (Envision) and GEP Tom Godward (KKR) and their teams helped position Envision to make better decisions about initiatives to launch during the divestiture and after it's completion. The Deals platform has a full team of professionals who can advise your clients on everything related to deals. And if your client is looking to close the next big deal, strike up a conversation on the latest deals trends by reading the new Deals industry insights. With Insourced Solutions for Tax (IST) from the Managed Services platform, GEP Josh Carter and his team are advising financial services client Synchrony as they reduce costs, while preserving the feeling of having a dedicated in-house tax department and benefitting from our firm’s strong knowledge of their business. IST provides the non-audit client a team across our global network with in-house experience and technologies, to deliver tax services in a tech-enabled, efficient way. The Managed Services team can help you decide if IST is right for your non-audit client. A xLoS team aligned to the Risk &amp; Regulatory platform has begun an end-to-end assessment of a large financial services client’s bank products. Their focus is on compliance with federal consumer protection requirements, inclusive of an assessment of terms and conditions, and testing of the control environment. As a trusted advisor to our client, GEP Ellen Walsh and her team made sure we brought the right experience and capabilities to advise the client by creating a xLoS and cross-functional team that includes Risk Assurance, Consumer Finance Group, Digital Banking, Financial Crimes and Regulatory Technology, all enhanced by SDC and Talent Exchange capabilities and resources. Additionally, we are building Salesforce apps to digitally enable our delivery and help make our client's risk and compliance processes more sustainable. From global trade services to tax reform to regulatory response and compliance, the Risk &amp; Regulatory platform has the right people to help deliver solutions for your clients. And keep in mind, your client may benefit from insights or thought leadership related to the platforms to the extent a full solution may not be the right answer, or permissible, for an audit client. You can help us develop tools and resources to bring the power of platforms to our non-audit clients by taking this five-minute survey on PwC Surveys, now open through May 14.

Team, Last Friday, I had the honor of speaking to a brand new group of accounting professionals as they graduated from the University of Southern California’s Leventhal School of Accounting. As many of you know, I’m an optimist -- and there’s nothing more optimistic than being part of the celebration of talented people who are now ready to go out and make their mark on the world. Our world faces a lot of tough issues. But when I see the many committed, values-driven people -- like you, our clients, and these graduates -- that gives me confidence that we can take on the tough issues and succeed. Among the brand new USC graduates is a new member of our PwC community. Sofia Roberts received her Master’s in Accounting on Friday and spoke to her fellow graduates -- taking the podium just before me. She’ll be joining us as she starts her career. It was a very humbling experience to give the commencement address to these graduates. My advice to them was to remember that as leaders, they lead by example. Others are watching to see if they face tough issues with courage and integrity, if they are inclusive and living their values, and if they are treating others with care and respect. For those who might be interested, here’s my full speech. It was a great day -- and I feel very fortunate to represent our firm and all of you at events like this.

PwC has an obligation to our clients to protect their confidential information from access by third parties, but also to limit the number of PwC employees with access to that same information. We should share client information with others within the firm only when the access is necessary to perform services for which we have been engaged (i.e., a "need to know"). Although DMS has functionality such that personnel can be given access to all jobs and projects performed for a client ("broad client file access" or "client level access"), most personnel do not need and should not receive broad client file access or client level access. Rather, as set forth in the PwC policy on "Confidentiality and DMS Access," personnel who do not have a client level "need to know" should be granted restricted access. (Note: under most circumstances a person who is not in the U.S. does not have a broad "need to know” and therefore should NOT be given head client level access (even if they have a US Visitor GUID)). Access levels In general, partners, managing directors, directors and managers (collectively, "managerial personnel") who have a client level "need to know" (regardless of their geographic location) may be granted client level access. Managerial personnel that do not have a client level "need to know" should be grantedrestricted access. Seniors, associates, and non-managerial personnel (collectively, "non-managerial personnel") should not be given client level access unless they are day-to-day members of the "lead client engagement team" and have a client level "need to know." Accordingly, restricted access should be granted for such non-managerial personnel. Example ABC Inc. is a client of the Boston office. Partner 1, Manager 1 and Senior Associate 1 are involved in several engagements on this client, are the day-to-day "lead client engagement team" members and have a client level "need to know." Several senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office are assisting with a tax return preparation engagement on this client. The senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office are not working on other engagements for this client and therefore do not have a client level "need to know." Client level access should be granted to Partner 1, Manager 1 and Senior Associate 1 because they are the day-to-day members of the "lead client engagement team" with a client level "need to know." The senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office should be given restricted access to the tax return preparation job/project they are working on. If the Atlanta office personnel need access to information maintained in other job/projects for that client, the lead engagement team member can move the relevant information to the appropriate job/project, or the Tax Engagement Partner can grant client level access to the appropriate Atlanta personnel for a short/limited period of time. Marking a folder restricted Within DMS, select the Subclient, Job or Project. Select PwC &gt; Security &gt; Mark Restricted See Marking and Unmarking a Subclient, Job or Project Restricted for detailed examples.

His Career Milestone sabbatical was his chance to show them that he could, indeed, unplug. "I had three goals for my sabbatical: spending quality time with family, seeing a World Wonder and picking up a new skill," Sal said. He achieved all three, and extended his four-week sabbatical to six weeks by taking it close to the firm's year-end shutdown and adding vacation time. Malaysia, Dominican Republic and Peru Sal’s trip began in Malaysia, where he met up with family and explored the country's diverse landscape and culture. He then visited Hong Kong, where he joined some of his PwC colleagues and "crashed" a PwC holiday party. The next stop was the Dominican Republic, relaxing on the picturesque beaches of Punta Cana with friends, exploring the rich heritage of Santo Domingo and ringing in the New Year by staying up all night dancing to salsa and hip hop at a famous nightclub. "The grand finale was one week in Peru, an experience I could have never imagined," said Sal. "I toured the city of Lima, traveled to the Cusco Region, and was in awe of Machu Picchu, one of the Seven Wonders of the World." With everything going so smoothly, it's hard to believe that Sal barely planned his trip ahead of time. "Except for the Malaysia visit, I only had a loose idea of where I wanted to go beforehand and was pleasantly surprised by how it turned out," he said. “Growing up in Palestine, I never imagined I’d be able to see the world like this; I’m extremely lucky." Planning ahead But what wasn't extemporaneous was planning ahead with his teams and partners. "I worked tirelessly over a three-month period before I left to make sure everyone, and everything, was fully covered,” he said. Everyone was supportive, even his clients. “Once they heard me mention seeing my family, and how this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, they understood its importance.” Sal’s teams appreciated the opportunity to enhance their own leadership skills while he was away. "This allowed me to fully unplug,” he said. “I can't thank my very talented teams enough.” So, what was the new skill he achieved? "Being in Latin America allowed me to strengthen my global acumen by recovering my conversational Spanish,” he said. “I’m now working hard to advance toward fluency. When I started speaking they thought I was fluent just from my first few words, so I had to ask them to slow down after that!" Any advice for those who have sabbaticals coming up? "Don't be afraid to take risks, set clear goals and prepare your teams way ahead of time." Reaching the senior manager or director level is a significant career accomplishment and one worth celebrating. As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors and IFS directors with five or more years of service are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to disengage, recharge and truly focus on their well-being and life outside of work.

Restart your commitment to working in new wa Got a Salesforce license? Restart your commitment to working in new ways HQ News Aug. 23, 2018 It’s FY19, and there’s no better time to revisit the new ways of working in Salesforce. Salesforce helps strengthen our professional relationships and, for those of us in non-audit roles, helps grow our pipeline. And, for audit clients, the focus is on using Salesforce as a tool to assist with engagement management. Here’s how some of your fellow Salesforce users are making a difference: “Salesforce allows me to easily measure how my opportunities are progressing and quickly get a status to identify next steps.” “On my Salesforce mobile app, I love that after a meeting as you go out the front door, you can take a note with voice command and save it right into system. It’s so easy and fast!” “To get the most out of Salesforce’s relationship management benefits, I take just a little bit of time -- less than a minute -- to enter contacts and use ‘relate me’ to help connections across the firm.” Here are 6 things you can do to make a difference to Salesforce results and relationships in FY19: Progress those pursuits -- Use the winning practices in this tip sheet to help you leverage Salesforce across the Pursuit phases. Connect your opps -- Salesforce allows you to "relate" Opportunities so that you can easily view and report on Opportunities that are connected. Try this out for phased or recurring work, change orders or pull-through projects. Tag that Platform -- Tagging platforms in Salesforce highlights important One Firm opportunities and trends to leadership. You should designate a platform for each opportunity entered. Go mobile -- The mobile app provides a convenient and easy way to stay connected to Salesforce when you’re on-the-go. Download it through the PwC app exchange and start to use voice-to-text notes, add quick opportunities, Chatter, and view dashboards. Understand Allocated Bookings -- With the Allocated Bookings functionality in Salesforce, partners and MDs can allocate credit among the other partners/MDs on the Opportunity. Keep it current -- Only Opportunity team members have edit access in order to preserve data and pipeline quality. If you’d like to be added to the Opportunity, @mention other sales team members through Chatter, and request to be added. No need to use email! Questions? Need help? We’ve got you covered! Visit the US/MX Salesforce Spark site for QRGs, FAQs, videos and more. It’s your go to spot for all things Salesforce. Still have questions? The Salesforce Total Care Network is always available.

According to Bill Gilet, partner and global leader of our Advisory Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Practice, “Particularly when it comes to issues like shared services and business process automation, clients regularly ask us, ‘how do you do things at PwC?’” In March, PwC showed 110 representatives from 60 companies -- including a number of clients -- how we “walk the talk.” As sponsor of a major shared services industry conference, the firm hosted a large group from the conference for a tour of our Business Services operation in Tampa. “This location is a major hub for PwC’s US internal business operations. Nearly all US firm business processes -- and many global ones -- are either developed or managed here,” said Joe Killian, PwC’s Business Services managing partner. “Our teams provide PwC the same capabilities and sustained excellence our partners and client service professionals offer our clients. We are also reinventing how PwC does business.” During the tour, a team of PwC Advisory partners and IFS directors showcased how we’re putting the principles we tout to work in our own firm. From using bots for automating human capital and hoteling processes to a breakthrough idea-to-innovation approach that enables continuous streamlining in Finance Controller Operations, the team shared the best of PwC’s internal firm services. Leaders discussed our Chief Data Office’s approach to managing the ever-growing data pool. The visiting group even got a peek into our Cyberfusion Security Center and glimpsed our next-level protections against cyber threats. “By showcasing PwC’s internal applications of our own methods, Advisory and IFS were able to give this group of clients and conference attendees a valuable view of what great looks like,” said Bill Gilet. PwC leaders address clients and visitors from Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Week.

I want to wrap up the week with a reminder that PwC is committed to advancing an inclusive workplace and society, and we proudly support the transgender community and its allies. We have joined 180 other CEOs and corporate leaders who are calling for respect for all and equality under the law for transgender, gender non-binary and intersex people. You can see the statement here. What we are saying is that treating everyone fairly is the right thing for our friends, family members and colleagues, and it’s also the right thing for our business. Of course, our firm did not wait for this ruling to open up the conversation about creating an inclusive environment for all of our people. Two years ago we published Gender Inclusivity and Transition Guidelines to be clear about PwC's approach to supporting transgender professionals. So, while this isn’t new, I want to remind all of us that these guidelines are in place -- and that our commitment to our people is unwavering. No matter what is happening outside the walls of PwC, we value the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the people of PwC. As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, it’s up to us to work together to be a place where everyone feels they belong, and we support each other so we all have the opportunity to realize our full potential. Our workplace will always be free of discrimination. We will always be committed to our values and to being a diverse and inclusive firm.

Unconsciously, our bias can influence how inclusive we are as colleagues and leaders. The new Outsmarting Human Minds (OHM) podcasts are one way to help develop inclusive leaders and build a firm where we all feel a sense of belonging and value. What’s OHM? With a grant from PwC, Harvard University developed a series of podcasts, videos and other materials that apply insights from psychological science to help us improve the decisions we make in life and at work -- specifically around helping us understand our blind spots. Listen to these three new podcast episodes -- each is only 10 minutes long. Accent Bias: Voices are more than sounds. They’re auditory faces that can give clues to who we are. In the time it takes to say “hello,” we can identify a person’s ethnic or cultural background as different from ours. Yet this can lead to other impressions that are just wrong. How might accents influence our judgments? And what’s the cost? The Standards We Choose: Book-smart or street-smart? Education or experience? We like to think we use objective criteria to make decisions. But what happens when we choose the person first, then use the standard that supports our decision? How might the “pictures in our heads” drive the criteria we choose? Shifting Standards: Leonardo Da Vinci, we would say, is a genius. Yet we might say the same for a puppy that can open a cabinet to get her snacks. Sometimes it makes sense to shift our standards based on context. But are we raising and lowering the bar when we shouldn’t? As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, PwC invests in developing inclusive leaders. That’s why we launched Outsmarting Human Minds (OHM) and blind spots training. We believe challenging our assumptions will help us grow to better understand each other, accomplish even more together (and with our clients) and make an impact on society as a whole. After listening to the podcasts, check out the PwC discussion guide -- and take action. Start a dialogue on how to outsmart your mind and make unbiased decisions. You can also share our external Outsmarting Human Minds and blind spots sites with clients.

At PwC, our commitment to diversity and inclusion ties directly to our values. We’re committed to cultivating an environment where our people feel a sense of belonging. This means we can bring our whole selves to work, we can lead and grow through diverse experiences, and we can make a difference. Our inclusion networks are a big part of that. The Inclusion Networks Hub (powered by Diverst) and mentoring app (powered by Chronus) bring all our market-driven networks together in one virtual location. We’re enhancing our ability to connect and learn from one another, and continue to lead by example. In just a few clicks, you can access and collaborate with our existing networks, which are open to anyone (members, allies, learners and supporters), and drive inclusive culture at PwC daily. Previously, those interested in participating in an inclusion network would need to find their local inclusion email group and sign up to receive notifications of upcoming events and other news. The new Hub provides a single, digital home for all of PwC's inclusion networks, which will allow local inclusion groups to share information more efficiently, while also making it easier for our people to find inclusion networks they are interested in joining. Whether you’re currently a member of an Inclusion Network, are looking to join, or are just curious about our people and their passions, now is the time to start exploring the breadth of information available at pwc.diverst.com. You can join events, view news articles, start a mentoring relationship and much more. Back up … what are inclusion networks? Inclusion networks are affinity groups, networking circles and employee resource groups or ERGs. They are led by our partners and professionals who share a common background or life experience. They’re open to everyone -- members, allies, learners and supporters -- with the goal of helping to inspire and foster a work environment where our people feel comfortable being who they are and feel valued for their input. All inclusion networks have a common vision: creating and amplifying belonging. See these Hub and Chronus mentoring FAQs for more information on the portal and what the networks do. Questions?

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use our technology tools and Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. You may be part of one of the many teams already using bots to automate repeatable tasks and processes. Bots deliver significant and sustainable value in short timeframes, while reducing overall risk and freeing up time to focus on delivering even greater value and quality service. To help us get going, new Bot Immersion Experience sessions are being piloted that immerse users in an advanced training environment that pushes them to build complex bots using UiPath, troubleshoot common errors and learn best practices so they can build confidently. In the Hackathon portion of the experience, teams go from brainstorming a bot idea to building it using the tips they learned. And professional software developers are on hand to help teams work through issues faced. We talked to two recent pilot participants — Sima Riggs and Zachary Revermann — to hear more. Read on to learn more about their experience, as well as ways you can join the robot revolution. Why did you raise your hand for the pilot and what was your impression of the training? Sima: I was completely new to technology before starting my upskilling journey with the firm. With my Digital Accelerator and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) training, I had a good understanding and had built one or two bots but knew I could do more. This two-day immersion turned that understanding into action. Zac: “I have always been interested in anything tech-related. I had completed the initial foundations training and built a few bots, but felt like I had hit a plateau. In this session, I met other bot-building colleagues from across the firm that helped me break that. And, we still share resources and are actively building bots together today.” What were some takeaways? Sima: “The session inspired me to build more. I revisited a bot I had built before the training with the new skills I had learned, realizing it could be more effective and not break as much.” Zac: “I also found other ways to simplify and improve a bot that I was currently working on with help from the software developers. The session sparked a lot of ideas for how to build better bots and utilize additional features within the technology. My Hackathon team from the immersion session is about to submit our solution from the session to Digital Lab. We’re really excited about it and think it could have a positive impact for our colleagues.” How does Digital Lab play a role for you? Sima: “It is so helpful to see how others constructed their bots via Digital Lab. There are a lot of ways to achieve the same outcome with robotics.” Zac: “The competition from the site is a good push for me. I visit nearly every day, sort the feed by upload date, download anything new I see that could be helpful and see how it was built. I actually just redeemed my rewards from the site too, which is a nice bonus. I already have about 10 assets on Digital Lab and am now fired up to do more.” Any advice for other PwCers? Sima: “Complete some of the trainings out there — Digital Lab Immersion sessions or Bot Foundations — and then just start playing around. Just get to building and try different options for solving the problem.” Zac: “PwC has a lot of different learning options you should check out. There is the RPA tool site, Digital Lab, and RPA experts to help with review and more. Start with the basics — take a training to understand how the software works, then write down some ideas for pain points in your daily work and then just try to build it. Nothing is better than the hands-on trial and error.” Looking for more hands-on training on robotics or Digital Lab? Start by signing up for a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion Session in Vantage. Search Digital Lab for digital assets like bots, then download and use them. To access resources that may be able to assist you in building a proposed bot idea, submit your idea via Digital Lab. And as always, visit the Digital Hub for all things Digital Upskilling. *If you have already completed the Level 1 Foundations training in RPA, you can sign up for an upcoming session of this Bot Immersion session pilot on Vantage: Los Angeles April 10-11 Chicago May 28-29 Houston June 4-5 Have you already earned 150 points in Digital Lab, fulfilling that portion of the Learn2earn challenge?

It also can lead to poor eating habits, sleep deprivation or lack of exercise. Want some remedies? See these 20 tips that cover all four dimensions of energy to make sure you stay on track while on the road. Physical Establish a bedtime routine specifically for when you travel (pre-trip, during the trip, on return). Find healthy food options before you arrive at your destination. Research hotel fitness options and create a workout plan. Schedule your day in 90-minute sprints with clear finish lines. Declare a specific end to your work day and stick to it. Emotional Talk to others on the road or at home about the interesting or positive experiences of traveling. Call or leave a video message for a loved one each morning/evening. Schedule time in your travel schedule for the things you enjoy most. Send a note to someone you appreciate, making sure to be specific about why you appreciate them. Load your phone with photos of enjoyable experiences you’ve had recently, music or podcasts you can escape into. Mental Create a packing list you can refer to every trip. Download Packing Pro and other travel apps from PwC’s App Store. Create a priority list in advance with key colleagues and clients you plan to meet. Block 30-90 minutes at the start of the day for your first commitment. Build in downtime to your schedule where you’re completely disconnected from work. Establish a reflection journal to note how you’re managing energy on the road. Share with your team at your next meeting. Spirtual Pack your purpose (discuss this with someone who knows you well). Book your return flight at a reasonable time. Make time for yourself at some point during the day. For example, meditate or read a few pages of your book. Pack items that remind you of what's important. Look for opportunities to volunteer in the areas you’re traveling to.

Here's Do you have contract changes to standard terms and conditions? Here's what you need to do. One Firm Risk Organization April 25, 2019 The engagement contract constitutes the agreement between PwC and the client and is the most effective way to document our mutual understanding of the scope of the engagement, the anticipated deliverables, the fees for our services and the terms under which we will perform our services. PwC’s standard contract provisions are incorporated in the Engagement Letter (EL) templates found on CREATE for Tax, which have been approved by the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) Tax team and the Office of General Counsel (OGC). Standard key contract provisions are regularly updated to comply with changes in Firm policy or changes in tax law, regulations and ethical or professional standards. Accordingly, it is important to retrieve the electronic templates when drafting the engagement contract to ensure that you are engaging your client under the most recent terms and conditions. Any modifications to the standard terms and conditions in an EL, Master Services Agreement (MSA), Global Master Framework Agreement (GMFA), etc. will require the approval of OFRO Tax as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process. To obtain OFRO Tax approval, properly complete the questions in Section 2.2 on the Data Use Language and 2.3 on Limitation of Liability. Also mark “Yes” to question 2.4 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment if you have other changes and answer the questions that follow appropriately; providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Question 2.4: Terms &amp; Conditions Changes Other than for terms expressly allowed at the engagement partner's discretion pursuant to Contract Guidance for Engagement Teams AND other than Liability Limits covered above: Are you using a previously negotiated Engagement Letter or MSA that contains nonstandard terms? OR Has the Client requested changes to standard Terms &amp; Conditions? OR Does the client have a separate Confidentiality Agreement that does not conform to PwC Policy? * Yes No Each EL or Statement of Work (SOW) issued under a MSA that contains nonstandard and/or changes to terms and conditions will require OFRO Tax approval each time on the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment as part of the engagement set-up process. That is, even if you have received approval from OFRO Tax, the Contracting Center of Excellence (CCoE) and/or OGC in the past for the term modifications (separately or in a previous Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment), each engagement stands on its own and requires OFRO Tax approval. Thus, mark this question “Yes”. If you answer Yes to question 2.4, you will be prompted with a question inquiring if you have received an approved OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note from your Regional Tax OFRO Partner for the engagement contract (e.g., an EL, MSA, or GMFA) governing your new engagement. OFRO A&amp;C Exception Notes are formal documents that are issued by Regional Tax OFRO Partners after assessing the nonstandard terms and conditions of the engagement contract and evaluating the incremental risk to the firm for prospective engagements is acceptable. Exceptions should NOT be requested. [Note: OFRO review and approval of your non-standard engagement contract in an email does not constitute an OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note.] If you have not received a formal OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note, answer “No” to question 2.4.1. If the contract (EL, MSA, GMFA, etc.) is amended in any way other than extending its term, the Exception Note immediately expires. Certain provisions in our engagement letters (e.g., Scope of Our Services, Client Responsibilities, etc.) may be modified by engagement teams based on the specific client circumstances without further consultation or OFRO Tax approval. A good reference for Tax engagement teams is the Contract Guidance for the Tax Engagement Letters, which provides guidance for evaluating proposed revisions or exceptions to our standard terms and conditions. It includes guidelines regarding what may be changed, what approvals are required and provides suggested responses to frequently asked questions. For additional information regarding modifications to engagement letter templates and standard terms and conditions, see the Engagement Terms: Requests for Modifications policy. Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

We committed to take action -- and today we see these actions come to life. Leading the business community through a Day of Understanding We asked the signatories of CEO Action for Diversity &amp; InclusionTM to join us in talking openly about diversity and race, and the potential for unconscious bias to hold back our collective progress on building more inclusive cultures inside and outside of our workplaces. Today, “Day of Understanding” conversations are beginning at more than 150 organizations, representing 1,000 locations and 400,000 employees. Guided by our purpose, we’ve shared our experience, insights and resources at no cost to help other organizations get started. I’m very proud to tell you that more than 100 of our PwC colleagues have volunteered to help facilitate these discussions and are representing PwC as a purpose-driven firm in a very powerful way. People across the country will have the chance to listen and understand each other better: to talk about how it feels to be a minority, or how it feels to be in the majority and want to be a better leader, co-worker and ally. These discussions are a great starting point for change within these companies and more broadly. Driving action within the walls of PwC Of course, we know there’s more we want to do within PwC, as well. To be the business we want to be, we must cultivate a firm where we each feel we belong and can contribute to our fullest. Today marks the launch of our Inclusive Leadership and Belonging at PwC sessions for managers and directors. Over the next week we’re holding nearly 300 sessions across our offices, where our managers, senior managers, directors and managing directors will focus on inclusive leadership. And as we work to become even more inclusive, I believe we are honoring Bo’s legacy. While I didn’t have the privilege of meeting Bo, I’ve heard many stories of how he inspired others around him and made them feel welcome and included -- and that’s an essential part of what it takes to be a leader today. If you think about where we’re headed as a firm, I believe inclusion becomes even more important -- so we can leverage the power of our differences along with the power of technology. This development opportunity will help our leaders understand the impact they have and the role they play in creating a sense of belonging for all. That’s how we’ll continue to attract great people to be part of PwC and bring diverse teams and ideas to help our clients find the best answers. Team, one last thought: I’m proud of the investment we’re making in growing inclusive leaders at PwC. But we don’t need to wait for a training to make a difference. As you might have heard, through CEO Action we’ve created the the “I Act On” pledge. You can make a pledge anytime to support the effort on inclusion -- and I encourage you to share this with your teams, friends and clients, and ask them to make a personal commitment. We can all help lead the change towards an even more inclusive PwC and a more inclusive world.

I want to address one question up front. We’ve invested significantly in building up our capabilities because we want to provide great quality and value -- and help our clients solve their issues from start to finish. We’re moving forward in this particular situation because the right set of circumstances exist to allow our Public Sector business to grow and scale to their maximum potential. We believe this is the right next step for our Public Sector business, for our partners and staff in that business, and for the firm. For those who aren’t familiar with it, the US Public Sector business has primarily focused on serving the federal, state and local government authorities in the US as well as certain multilateral agencies. This 1,500-person practice has an excellent brand and client base – and a strong track record of growth. Scott McIntyre, our Public Sector leader, and the entire team can be proud of the strong and successful business they have built. Veritas Capital is a leading private equity firm that invests in companies which provide critical products and services, primarily technology or technology-enabled solutions, to government and commercial customers worldwide. Veritas has a strong brand and in-depth knowledge and understanding of government clients. Their focus on making their portfolio companies more important to their customers by enhancing their capabilities will enhance the brand and purpose of our Public Sector business -- and provide our Public Sector team with a strong platform for career growth. In addition, this opportunity will enhance the great market position that the Public Sector business has today, and provide access to additional avenues for capital to position them for continued growth and success. The transaction also creates investment capacity that will let us do even more with our Your Tomorrow agenda and accelerate the journey to our digital future. Together with Veritas, we have issued a press release and you may get questions from clients or others in your network. Please do not comment on social media or if contacted by the press. If clients want more information, don’t go it alone -- please talk with your partner(s) to determine the best approach.

Here’s a success story about how one team was able to realize these benefits. Salesforce is helping the Actuarial Services team in big ways with better and quicker reporting, more collaboration across lines of service, and data transparency -- all adding up to time savings and better results. To shift their reporting from Google Sheets into Salesforce, the team: Received guidance from Salesforce support Provided an upfront time investment Explored new opportunities provided within Salesforce Assurance Director Vicki Fendley teamed up with Senior Associate Kathryn Frerman to develop the strategy and manage the path forward. “The investment in the transition time and effort was well spent, as it set the team up for success,” said Kathryn. “At first, it was a challenge to move the whole team into Salesforce,” Vicki explained. “Now, it's reassuring to know we’re all looking at the same information -- we’re truly benefiting from increased data transparency, and we have more trust in the information we’re reporting.” Salesforce is also driving enhanced collaboration. “We’re seeing a lot more connectivity with client strategists, CREs and xLoS teams as we’re creating more connected opportunities to enable our practice reporting,” Vicki said. “We have also been tying our pipeline reporting into our financial forecasting with more confidence in the accuracy of the underlying information." “Salesforce has improved efficiencies. We no longer reach out to individuals to collect updates -- we have a consolidated view so we can provide meaningful real-time information to both Finance and leadership, and facilitate greater collaboration and teaming on pursuits!” Looking to drive similar results in Salesforce? Start with these steps: Schedule a 30-minute support appointment with the Salesforce Learning &amp; Support team - Consult with a Salesforce specialist to better understand how to implement the new ways of working Drive pursuit conversations through Chatter - Chattering directly on an opportunity in Salesforce increases collaboration and reduces email traffic Bring the right people to the conversation - @Mentioning key team members in Chatter drives greater, quicker collaboration around client relationships and opportunities Use Salesforce dashboards during Go-to-Market, Pipeline and Account Team meetings - Looking at the same dashboard directly in Salesforce, instead of stagnant reports, provides the whole team with the latest information Questions?

What are you doing to protect your clients’ personal data? One Firm Risk Organization Oct. 18, 2018 New laws being implemented globally, including the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require companies to pay closer attention to how they handle personal data. To comply with these laws and meet client expectations about how we protect the personal data they provide in the course of an engagement, PwC has implemented a Network Data Protection Program (NDPP). NDPP provides a consistent approach across our global network of firms for handling and protecting personal data. What is personal data? The scope of personal data goes beyond a few identifiers we may typically consider, such as name, date of birth, home address and Social Security number. It also includes bank account numbers, medical condition information, photos, videos, location history, online browsing history, political opinions, trade union status and other information that relates to an individual. How NDPP changes the way we handle and protect personal data For each engagement that involves personal data, NDPP requires that we document certain details about personal data. Personal data of individuals residing in the EU requires a greater level of documentation including the type, source, access, transfer, storage and use of personal data. For engagements involving high risk EU personal data, consultation with the Privacy Office may be required for developing a risk mitigation plan or performing a Data Protection Impact Assessment. What you and your engagement team need to know and do To facilitate compliance with NDPP, we have embedded a set of personal data-handling questions into our existing engagement acceptance and planning workflow. These questions help identify risks related to the processing of personal data. For Tax and Advisory, questions have been added to the Engagement Acceptance Form (EAF). For audit and attestation engagements, questions have been added to the Data Protection Planning Considerations EGA in AURA (see Audit Alert 18/32). In all lines of service -- limit, protect and respect personal data by following the Information Protection Principles (IPPs). If clients ask about PwC’s approach to handling personal data or compliance with the GDPR, you can share this compliance statement.

Ultimate Software had several business changes, including a failed ERP implementation, a new CFO, and a change in ownership structure and growth expectations. The new CFO took a key leadership position in the entity and determined that a finance modernization initiative was needed to get ready for the growth expected, including a complete ‘digitization’ of the finance function. What was our solution for Ultimate Software? We leveraged the Finance Transformation Integrated Solution to win a rapid ERP implementation (Microsoft Cloud Dynamics365) at Ultimate Software. This win was a combined outcome from the strength of our Microsoft Alliance relationship and our Finance Transformation solution, powered by Microsoft toolkit. We met the client’s immediate needs through our Finance-in-a-Box offering (Microsoft Cloud) and built a relationship with the newly appointed CFO and VP of Transformation to identify the desire for a Finance Target Operating Model (FTOM) and Billing Transformation. While working on the above initiative, we won another ERP Change Management project that involved setting up a Finance Change office and exploring Digital upskilling, M&amp;A and establishing an Integration support office for Ultimate Software. What results will Ultimate Software see using our solution? The results Ultimate Software will see supports our Fit for Growth platform message: organizations need to reinvent themselves to prepare for a faster moving and unpredictable future. By combining phases of work across teams, we will provide Ultimate Software with an operating model blueprint and a refined finance strategy that complements the process digitization they have planned though Microsoft D365. This will support scaling their business to 4 times the current revenue. How is this win significant and what results will we see? The collaboration across alliances, xLos and cross teams, will grow this client from a primarily tax account, to an xLoS account that is a priority in the Florida market. Not to mention, give us an increased revenue potential from &lt;$50K to over $5M in year one, while maintaining a margin over 30%! Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions? Check out Consulting Source and the Integrated Solutions Learning Hub.

You update your password and move on. But that’s just the beginning of your trouble. Hackers then try to use those credentials to break into your social media accounts. And if they do, it can create a real mess. They pose as you to phish your followers, steal your personal and financial info and so much more. It’s called credential stuffing, and it’s a nightmare — this is how the drama might play out. Here’s how to protect yourself on social media: Create unique passwords for each platform. To help manage your passwords, consider using a tool like 1Password. Use a complex password. Create more secure passwords by making them long, and use a combination of characters. See PwC’s Password Guidance. Enable two-factor authentication. Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and other platforms offer this option. Secure other accounts. Make sure to use these guidelines to protect your data on banking, shopping or other online platforms. A best practice is to not register or use your PwC email address for personal-use websites as it exposes that firm asset to unwanted and potentially malicious email.

An uptick in large-scale acquisitions With a wave of megadeals in 2018, overall US deal value increased 28% to more than $2 trillion – its highest point in three years. And 2019 already has seen multiple announced megadeals. Cross-sector interest, but not at the expense of scale While many deals continue to cross industry lines, most 2018 M&amp;A value was in transactions within a company’s sector. In 2018, same-sector M&amp;A accounted for two-thirds of deal volume but more than three-fourths of deal value. Private equity on the rise In addition to a 9% increase in volume from the previous year, PE deal value surged 41% to more than $347 billion – the most since 2014. Sectors drawing the most PE investment by value were tech, media and telecom; real estate; and oil and gas. More money in IPOs IPO volume and value were both up from 2017. In 2018 we saw more than 200 US IPOs, nearly one-third of them in pharma and life sciences. US buyers drive cross-border deals Despite an 11% decline in cross-border activity from Q3 to Q4, deal value rose by 17% last year. This increase was powered almost solely by a 34% increase in outbound US deal announcements. Now is the perfect time to strike up a conversation about your client’s M&amp;A strategy for the year ahead.

To get started, download this Quick Reference Guide for PwC’s special registration link, plus instructions to install the Chrome extension (be sure to use your Chrome browser). Once you’re set up on your PC, download the 1Password app from PwC's App Store or Google Work Play (you’ll find it under the productivity category).

Just click Forgot password? on your PC login screen, then follow the prompts. On your PwC mobile phone, you’ll receive a text with a verification code that’s good for 10 minutes. Enter the code on your PC, select a new password for your GUID/Windows login and you’re good to go. To use the password reset tool, your mobile number must be listed in Workday — if it’s not already there, add your number to Workday. If you’re a Mac user, stay tuned for a tool to come soon. Tip 3: Just say the magic word You’ve got a bunch of PwC passwords — and sometimes, you might need to reset something specific. Thankfully, PwC’s Service Hub helps you quickly navigate password resets for specific tools. All you have to do is remember the magic word: passwords/ Simply type passwords/ into your laptop’s web browser and hit return. Be sure to include the forward slash!

Northwestern Medicine (NM) wanted to launch the MyNM App to advance their goal of strengthening and differentiating NM’s relationship with its patients and caregivers. The app was seen as a strategic initiative with the potential to redefine the brand experience for both current and future patients and create an experience that drives foundational loyalty and growth. What was our solution for Northwestern? Through our deep expertise across a multidisciplinary team, we digitized Northwestern Medicine’s patient and caregiver experience, tailoring and personalizing the interactions across multiple touch points. We accelerated the delivery of this mobile solution by leveraging: the Patient Experience Integrated Solution, along with team expertise to provide Northwestern knowledge across areas of healthcare to integrate a mobile patient experience with the whole patient journey in mind; Management Consulting, Technology Consulting, Risk, Cyber, and also our Experience Center and offshore teams to provide the most holistic solution for Northwestern; business process depth across hospital revenue cycle; and, our Consumer Experience platform asset (CXP), part of the Patient Experience Integrated Solution. What results will Northwestern see using our solution? Overall, the results Northwestern Medicine will achieve with our solution supports the Fit for Growth platform message: organizations need to radically reinvent themselves to prepare for a faster moving and unpredictable future. With our Patient Experience integrated solution and FFG principles, we will help NM stand apart from their competition by building brand experience, loyalty and growth. How is this win significant and what results will we see? Rapid execution and market introduction - 6 months from an idea to launch in the app stores - of a best-in-class mobile solution for NM patients. Provides cutting-edge capabilities like wayfinding and advanced doc search and multiple integration points into a unified experience. Immediate adoption and continued week over week adoption of the app. Northwestern now has capability and capacity to execute on their own and established mobile application development practice for the organization. Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

Here’s a roundup of tech tips and reminders to help you save time and lay the groundwork for a more streamlined audit process. Aura Read these time savers for rolling forward last year’s Aura file and be sure to read the related Alerts: Release of the 2018 Aura libraries and the associated working practices Further enable use of the new Aura libraries (and avoid common pitfalls) by accessing these brief do’s and don’ts Get extra leverage: use SDCs to help with rollforward and other administrative activities Now REQUIRED: Use of the Aura IT dependencies functionality for PCAOB engagements with periods ending on or after December 15, 2018. (Refer to PwC Audit 3301.1). For a smoother setup in Aura, read these key reminders and tips. Remember the SDCs can help with setup activities, so get your reservations in now. New Evergreen templates simplify the process of documenting certain information year after year. For clients who have adopted ASC 606, information on new revenue FSLIs is included in Alert 18/14. Connect Connect v3 is here -- and it features some notable enhancements like faster document upload and download speeds, greater visibility across your portfolio with a new cross-site dashboard, and Aura integration! We recommend you transition to Connect v3 as soon as practicable. For calendar year public engagements, this will likely be either before or after the Q2 review is completed. (Note: Connect v3 is a separate website from the current version of Connect (v2.7). You can continue to use your existing Connect site (v2.7) until you and your client are ready to transition.) Leverage the transition materials on Spark, including information on how the SDC can assist, and reference our materials on explaining the change to your client. Connect Audit Manager and companion tools Connect Audit Manager is available for use on all multilocation engagements to simplify and streamline interoffice coordination and communications for group and component teams. Client Base is a central place for entering data points needed for a new Connect Audit Manager site. If you haven’t already, set up your Client Base template (and remember that the SDC can assist with the set-up and administration of Client Base and Connect Audit Manager). Connect Instructions Tool assists in creating group instructions for PwC component teams through the completion of a series of questions and prompts. Your responses to these questions and prompts drive the creation of interoffice instructions and appendices that are in accordance with the applicable auditing standards (ISA, PCAOB and AICPA) and PwC audit policies (Global and US). EMT Everything you need to know about getting your recurring EMTs done (deadlines, TEA considerations, GDM expectations and EMT360 reminders) can be found in the FY19 Recurring Engagement Pricing &amp; Planning document. Halo for MLA Scoping Does your team create Appendix B? Our new interactive, visualization tool -- Halo for MLA Scoping -- assists in creating the Appendix B based on the input and judgement applied by the engagement team reducing the time spent in the preparation of the quantitative summary. The new tool facilitates the step-by-step process described in PwC Audit 1703.4 and PwC Audit (NP) 1703.4, and automates certain manual elements of the financial analysis. Then, Halo provides real-time visualization of the impact of your scoping judgments and helps create multilocation audit scoping documentation. myIC Verify that your final report release date entered in myIC is appropriate since myIC will stop tracking new individuals once your completed confirm is past your final report release date. The date can be updated as often as you need before you reach the date entered in myIC. When creating a new confirmation only include the current year’s contract and WBS codes DocuSign Use DocuSign to electronically send and sign engagement letters and management rep letters for US-based audit and attest clients. DocuSign is mobile, so right on your device, you’re getting reminders (or your client is) and the process is moving along faster than it ever has (and it’s secure). Count Teams measuring inventory should use Count (except for those relating to Retail Inventory Method). Remember that even if counters are unable to use the Count mobile app during an observation, the Count Portal can still be used by engagement teams to coordinate the observation and counters can submit documentation using the Count desktop app following the observation.

Can you break out of the annual training escape room? Ethics &amp; Compliance Nov. 16, 2018 This year’s Independence, Ethics and Compliance training is now available. It’s more digitally enabled and provides you with more flexibility to fit your busy schedule. The training begins with an escape room challenge required for everyone. Once you complete the challenge, you decide how to finish the rest of the mobile-enabled training. There are two versions to choose from: one that’s CPE-eligible, and another containing shorter learning modules that isn’t eligible for CPE. You only need to complete one, so decide which one you’ll take depending on your CPE credit needs. If you’re a manager or above and don’t need CPE credit, you can test your skills and save time -- pass a knowledge assessment in lieu of the course requirements. Want a sneak peek? Watch the short video below with Jude Curtis, US Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer, and Sam Burke, US Partner Responsible for Independence, as they explain the new, engaging format for this important Core Compliance Requirement. No matter which path you take, your training must be completed by April 23, 2019, at 11:59 p.m. ET/8:59 p.m. PT. The five-month window lets you manage your time to fulfill this required core compliance responsibility in a way that works best for you. Plan ahead. Completing the training could take 1½ to 2½ hours, depending on your role. Visit the annual training site for additional details and charge codes for your time. To get started on this training now, go to My Compliance Dashboard. Need a little nudge later on? Add one or more of these calendar reminders to help you complete your training requirement before the April 23 deadline: On the ball! &gt; + Add to calendar Dec. 4 New Year’s resolution &gt; + Add to calendar Jan. 8 Two months to go! &gt; + Add to calendar Feb. 13 Big nudge!

Here’s how one team was able to lean on our staff at the Service Delivery Centers (SDC) to meet their deadlines and exceed expectations during crunch time. During the 2017-2018 mutual funds audit cycle, the Vanguard Group - Mutual Funds team relied heavily on the SDC to complete certain test of details procedures and financial statement tie-outs. In a collective effort, the team and the SDC was able to identify and migrate multiple testing areas, such as additional amortization and derivatives procedures. The SDC supported the team in successfully incorporating a new fully electronic financial statement tie-out process, which reduced the number of hours staff spent preparing hard-copy references to be filed with Records Management. The SDC team went above and beyond in the transition of testing procedures. They delivered a quality of work that was consistent with the professional standards and brain-stormed ideas to develop more efficient methods for testing while maintaining the same if not higher, level of evidence. The open lines of communications allowed the two teams to develop a global relationship and act as one. Just as we all put out a call for help during crunch times to any resources with availability, we should leverage our SDCs as a powerful team of colleagues to support certain portions of the audit. This further enables enhanced quality, more time to address areas of potential or increasing risk, and the development of professional client relationships to enhance audit execution. For more on the ways the SDCs can support your team, visit them on Spark.

With Google’s new feature, your guests can access attachments directly from the Meet window, without navigating back to the calendar event. Plus, you can limit link request interruptions. In order for Meet to recognize an attachment, files must be attached to the calendar event via the paperclip icon. If you paste the URL of a Drive file into the description of a calendar event, Meet won’t recognize it as an attachment. To access attachments in Meet, simply click the arrow in the bottom left corner, and select Attachments. When you select an attachment through the Meet mobile app, it opens in the app best suited to that document (Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drive, etc).

Your team can move ahead with citizen-led innovation this busy season, with a very short investment of time. It just takes a few minutes and some imagination -- and it will help us continue to enhance quality long term. As you work through your engagements over the next three months, take time to identify tasks that could be automated using new technologies. Your team is in the best position to know where we can continue to make progress, taking highly manual activities and automating them using our new technologies. You can do it with three simple steps: First, meet as a team and discuss this project -- review what we mean by citizen-led innovation, understand what our key technologies are -- Alteryx, Tableau and UI Path -- and the types of activities that lend themselves to digitization. Learn more. Second, during the year end audit process -- think through what you’re doing, how you’re doing it, and how these tasks might be changed or enhanced using these technologies and tools And finally, capture your ideas real time. Look for more details in January on how you can easily share your suggestions during your engagements Then, in the spring, you’ll know where to prioritize our citizen led innovation, taking your team’s ideas and moving them from vision to reality. We all have a role to play in innovation in Assurance -- it starts and ends with each of us. And for right now, all you need to do is think through what you wish could be automated in the future, and take notes!

As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, PwC invested in continuing to develop inclusive leaders. Challenging our assumptions will help us understand each other better so we can accomplish even more together (and with our clients) and make an impact on society as a whole. Last year, we introduced blind spots training, based on leading research by Dr. Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard University. The training was all about understanding unconscious assumptions that can potentially shape our perceptions, decisions and behavior – and our ability to be effective leaders. Because of the importance of acknowledging our potential blind spots, we made viewing our 4REAL video training series a condition for new hires and promotion in FY17. We’ve also made a very visible statement by leading the way in creating the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™. But we know there’s much more work we want to do. Welcome to Outsmarting Human Minds (OHM) -- another opportunity to continue learning about blind spots, and to engage our teams and our clients along the way. With a grant from PwC, Harvard University developed this series of podcasts, videos and other materials that apply insights from psychological science to help us improve the decisions we make in life and at work. To be clear, OHM doesn’t take the place of the 4REAL series; rather, it is the next extension. These modules include: About face: Our faces broadcast information about us: whether we’re smart, warm and trustworthy. How do these signals affect decision-making -- and are they accurate? Who are we helping?: Humans help each other all the time. So what’s wrong with helping? Operating on autopilot: Expectations help us quickly navigate our world. Yet they can also keep us from the simple solutions, talent, and opportunities that are right in front of us. Moral credentialing: We work out, then pig out. We donate to charity, then indulge in retail therapy. Does this also happen with our deeds? How can we avoid using moral scorecards? The mind of the beholder: You perform well at work one day, but not the next. One person sees you as “warm,” another as “cold.” Maybe it’s you -- but there is another possibility: that a belief in one person’s mind can shape another person’s behavior. Irrational attachment: We overvalue the things we own. It’s fine if it’s a family keepsake or memento -- but how does this influence decisions we make about our homes and investments, and more? What you can do The first step is to complete the 4REAL (Recognize/Explore/Act/Learn) series. This self-guided video curriculum was created to help people make better decisions and foster inclusive actions. It’s required for all new hires and anyone seeking promotion. (4REAL content is for internal use only.) Next, continue developing as inclusive leaders by exploring the latest modules on the OHM website, and embody our values of working together and caring by sharing them with your teams, clients, friends and family and start to have open conversations about how you can outsmart your mind to create a better future. More blind spots training tools In addition to OHM, don’t forget about our other blind spots training tools: Blind spots public website: This set of materials -- videos, discussion guides, expert perspectives, quick quizzes -- helps create awareness on the presence and potential impact of blind spots, and focuses on the same four types of unconscious bias featured in the 4REAL series. CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion: This is the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace. If you spend time on campus, keep in touch with interns, have client contacts you think will be interested, or have family members getting started in the workplace -- talk to them about CEO Action and share the free, available blind spots training with them.

Juniper networks is a software corporation that develops networking products and network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology. They were interested in transitioning to a subscription based business model and had a goal to attain 20% subscription revenue within 4 years. What was our proposed solution for Juniper and how did we win? In support of our Fit for Growth value proposition to help clients create an environment for change to happen and culture to evolve, the team leveraged the Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) Integrated Solution to delight Juniper. We did this by: Showcasing industry highlights &amp; repeating success stories at SaaS Transformation. Conducting 3 day workshops (leveraging XaaS accelerators) to help Juniper evaluate its Product Portfolio, Operating Model, Readiness Gaps and Solution Vendor selection steps, and Customer Journey prioritization and planning. Highlighting experience from similar XaaS transformations With our deep expertise in the XaaS space, we were able to help our clients understand the difference between prepaid, postpaid, and consumption based subscription models. This triggered our clients to rethink their product and go-to-market strategy. What results will Juniper see using our solution? Robust operating model that enables Juniper to successfully attain 20% revenue from subscriptions over the next 4 years Alignment across required company functional areas and co-build the operating model Customer experience that rivals what competitors provide and customers expect Meet the team!

The military is a running theme in Gretchen Cahill’s life, and that’s just fine with her. A manager in the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO), Gretchen said, “I always knew I wanted to serve my country, yet as a child I thought I would have a career as a public servant. But when a family friend suggested an opportunity to attend West Point US Military Academy, I was hooked.” After graduating from West Point, Gretchen attended flight school and the Army stationed her in Germany. Her dual dedication to flying and patriotism dovetailed when she served as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot during the Iraq invasion in 2003. “Initially, our unit completed deep insertions, where we placed soldiers behind enemy lines,” she said. “We also conducted search and rescue missions for missing or injured soldiers. Eventually, we coordinated routine flights around the country where we transported soldiers safely between locations.” Gretchen jokes that her unit served as a glorified taxi service. “But we really did provide the safest way to move troops around the battlefield.” The work was important on many levels. “Transporting our soldiers safely in the air allowed them to avoid the growing concern of improvised explosive devices on the ground.” Her unit also supported missions to destroy weapons caches. “We flew above vast Iraqi deserts to support the Apache gunships with our long-range radios tying back into headquarters as their pilots reported and destroyed weapons caches,” she said. She and her husband Paul, who was also in the military, had back-to-back deployments abroad at the same time. The two ultimately returned stateside to resume military service. “I coordinated operations planning for air assault missions at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for the 5th Battalion, 101st Airborne Division,” she explained. “The air assault missions involved soldiers rappelling out of aircraft and carrying equipment across battlefields.” Gretchen left the military after seven years to stay at home with their children. When the family later moved to Washington, D.C., Gretchen attended a local women's military academy networking event where she spotted another female West Point graduate at the PwC recruiting booth. “She basically said, ‘Come join us’! It didn’t take long to see that PwC was the right choice for me.” After six years on the Public Sector team leading change management efforts for PwC clients, Gretchen sought to find another position in the firm. “We had just relocated to Hartford and my Public Sector position required me to be at the client site in Washington, D.C.,” she explained. “PwC’s Veterans Affinity Network helped me navigate the firm to find a tour of duty in Advisory Risk and Quality, which ultimately led to my current, full-time IFS role on the Quality Reviews &amp; Monitoring team in the One Firm Risk Organization.” Gretchen remains grateful for her military experiences and the shared values of the armed services and PwC. “The support of the firm has been there since day one,” she said. “They understand and respect the ongoing commitment of our military veterans, whether flying a helicopter or sitting at a desk!” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

In this PwC Inside series, we’ll introduce you to PwCers who have embraced Digital Upskilling and are helping us build the skills we need to thrive in a digital world. Today, meet Jay Rodriguez and Jason Ashenfelter. Each has a unique story that we hope will inspire you to increase your own digital acumen. Jay Rodriguez is an Assurance associate from Philadelphia who, in his own words “... strives to identify technology-created efficiencies in audit approaches and testing procedures.” By participating in a Digital Academy and utilizing resources in Digital Lab, Jay learned to work with data-wrangling tools that helped him build a model to standardize reports for his large financial services client. The tools also greatly reduced the hours required on the back end of the project. Jay’s model eliminated human error and greatly increased the quality of the work. Additionally, he took a 100+ hour workload per year end -- there are eight annually -- and reduced it to 10 to 15 hours in subsequent year ends, with the delivery of results moving forward more than seven days. A short while ago, Jay would have said that technology was his greatest weakness. Now, with some quality time invested each week in building his digital acumen, he feels technology is his greatest strength. Jay’s advice to those who work on a process that could be simplified or standardized? Don’t be afraid to rebuild proven models. Another tip: Jay found online technology communities provided quick solutions to complex data-analysis issues. Jason Ashenfelter is a director in the Advisory Financial Services Regulatory practice, based in our Cleveland office. Jason is both a digital student and teacher. He began building his digital knowledge via internet sites like YouTube and Khan Academy, later becoming a Digital Accelerator. Now, he's shown his client ways to leverage bots -- automating the analysis of thousands of documents -- and trained his team to use them. This has enhanced our value proposition with our clients by advising on opportunities to leverage technology and integrating digital solutions into our internal processes. Jason advises: “Although our Digital Upskilling journey may appear to be a tall order now, we should consider other digital solutions that at the time were new and unknown, such as our Google suite of products. Over time, these tools have become second nature. It’s only a matter of time before the new solutions being introduced through Digital Upskilling will, too.” Want to build your own digital skills? A good place to start is the Digital Hub, the home to all things Digital Upskilling. You’ll find pre-reads to get ready for PowerUp! games, Learning Bursts, Tech While You Trek podcasts, Digital Quests and more. And don’t forget our FY19 Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal for everyone at PwC -- earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests on or before June 30, 2019. As an added incentive, get an early start through Learn2earn by completing all four Digital Quests and earning 150 Digital Lab points before April 30 and you’ll be entered in a raffle for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win!

One of these solutions is Digital Crime Fighters, a combination of apps, models, bots and dashboards to fight financial crime (money laundering and fraud) as part of our Risk &amp; Regulatory platform. PwC's Financial Crimes Unit is the industry leader in Financial Crimes consulting. We bring a multi-disciplinary team across the globe, with unparalleled depth and breadth of services, talent, and relationships: Recently, the team helped non-audit client UBS with an engagement to reduce money laundering risk. The innovative, digitized approach took 10,000 hours out of a 80,000 total hour engagement by doubling down on automation. Just one example: the team created a bot to comb news articles for “bad guys” to identify negative information and summarize it using machine learning and natural language processing. The team also used a fixed pricing model. In just 4 months, this One Firm team of 110 partners and staff from Forensics, Consulting, Tax and Audit came together to make a tremendous impact. The client was pleased with the cost and value, and using this pricing model also improved margin on the engagement by 10 points compared to if we did the work manually and incurred the time on this fixed cost project.

Platforms Jan. 21, 2019 Guiding clients through complex situations is one of the many ways we help our clients position themselves for future success -- and our current regulatory environment is no different. You don’t need to be a policy specialist to start a conversation with your client. We’ve got you covered with new resources like our Top Policy Trends report and PwC’s Risk &amp; Regulatory platform. Your client may not even realize the potential impacts public policy could have on a digital transformation or workplace planning project, for example, and the opportunities they may want to seize. Here are the top four things to watch for on the policy front in 2019: Less clarity -- and more risk -- as policy making gets more fragmented. Companies are operating in a world of policy fragmentation, which is increasing costs for business and creating new risk. “Digital megaphone” and public sentiment exerting greater influence on policy making. A new player is entering the policy-making competition: the individual en masse. Social media has become a digital megaphone, capable of amplifying the voices of citizens and groups and making them viral. New strategies for addressing policy risk. Smaller policy-making bodies in states and localities now demand close attention. This requires a new approach to prioritizing and focusing limited government affairs resources and more focus on demonstrating results. The upside of policy competition. Increased policy competition could lead to a positive outcome: policies that better balance the demands of diverse stakeholders and that are implemented in a more efficient and effective manner. Our Top Policy Trends report addresses policy questions in three big areas affecting businesses: global trade, data and privacy, and the 4th industrial revolution. All of which have implications for clients, spanning supply chain, tax, Deals, operations and digital transformation -- just to name a few. Understanding emerging policy trends has never been more important, and our platforms can help identify the solutions that will help your non-audit clients make the most of them. So how can you get up to speed? Read the report, then join our webcast on Jan. 31. Connect with our Strategic Policy Advisers team about how your non-audit clients can take advantage of uncertainty in these divided times and create a proactive strategy for managing policy risk. And learn about all of our platforms, which shape how we go to market around the issues that are top-of-mind for our clients. While a full platforms solution is not appropriate for audit clients, they can still benefit from insights and thought leadership, including Top Policy Trends.

They apply to our people who became parents on or after April 1 and include: Four weeks of Family Care Leave for eligible PwC staff: Paid time off that can be used to care for a spouse, child, or parent, who has a serious health condition, as defined by the Family &amp; Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Increase of parental leave from 6 weeks to 8 weeks for both women and men: The majority of women will be eligible for 16 weeks including parental leave and maternity disability or adoption leave. Phased return to work option after parental leave: An innovative solution to the transition challenges parents face in coming back to work. Parents have the option to work 60%, at full-time pay, for an additional 4 weeks immediately following a parental leave. Up to $25,000 reimbursement, per child, combined adoption and surrogacy Free membership to sittercity.com: Find childcare, senior care and pet care services. Access to six hours of free Eldercare consultation: Call them for home assessments, implementation of care, and more. New employee assistance program provider LiveWell Resources (replacing LifeWorks): One of the most significant enhancements with LiveWell Resources is the inclusion of six free mental health visits, along with many other support services.

IFS continues to make significant contributions to our strategy, the strength of our firm and our Your Tomorrow goals. As you read in Tim Ryan’s article in today’s PwC Inside, our business is strong and we’re making tremendous strides in digitizing PwC. We’re tracking slightly behind our revenue and engagement margin goals, so we all need to do our part in helping to manage costs and in using technology and automation to work more efficiently. Your efforts make a difference! Speaking of technology, I also encourage you to give special focus to your personal digital upskilling journey over the next several weeks. Remember, we’re all aiming to earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badges by the end of the fiscal year -- with a special incentive to complete that goal by April 30 through Learn2earn. Finally, please join me Tuesday, April 16 for our IFS all-hands webcast, live from Tampa. If you haven’t yet, please respond to the invitation that’s already on your calendar (and if you don’t see it, click here to add one). Our agenda includes: A firm strategy update An IFS-focused digital upskilling and automation update from Alex Chen, Global Delivery Model Services Leader, and panel discussion/practical advice from three of our IFS colleagues: Fabiola Nunez, Mexico Controller Operations Senior Associate; Dmitriy Meleshko, Accounting &amp; Financial Reporting Manager; and Bryant Pena, HRSSC Business Services Project Manager An engaging session about diversity and inclusion, including helpful strategies and actions we all can take to be more inclusive -- led by Paula Theus, New York Metro Market Diversity Leader A spotlight on our Administrative Services team and discussion with Rose Littlejohn, Administrative Services Leader Plenty of time for Q&amp;A, as always! Thank you for all you’re doing to help drive our success. I look forward to talking with you Tuesday! Sincerely, In FY19, PwC will realize our goal of becoming a truly digital organization -- and you play an important role. Let’s keep our focus on these three areas: Across IFS, we’re embedding One Firm behaviors and thinking into our everyday work. Let’s keep up the progress in promoting the use of One Firm tools like Salesforce and delivery through our platforms -- critical components of our strategy and our firm’s success. Consider all lines of service and IFS in your planning, and explore our IFS site to better connect across our teams. And remember that regardless of your role, taking a One Firm approach will help you build relationships, grow your business acumen and enhance your development. Thanks to all of our IFS team members who have been involved in continuous improvement initiatives this fiscal year, making life easier for everyone across the firm. Just three examples of many: We’ve enhanced our Rapid Engage client and engagement startup tool, introduced Request It to simplify Procurement orders, and released the latest version of our Phoenix workflow platform to simplify and streamline the way we engage with our service delivery centers. (Our IFS transition from Envoy to Phoenix begins this summer.) Team, I know many of you are contributing to our simplification efforts within your own functional groups and across IFS and the firm. Please keep up the great work and keep the innovative ideas coming! We’ll continue our discussion about digitizing the firm and upskilling ourselves during our IFS All Hands webcast next week. Make sure to join to hear practical advice for making the most of your own journey. We’re making great progress -- thanks for your efforts and enthusiasm! Digital Upskilling: More than 12,000 of us across the firm have already earned our Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests in the Digital Hub. You have just a couple of weeks left to participate in the Learn2earn challenge to be eligible for up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition. All you need to do is complete the four Digital Quests and earn at least 150 points in Digital Lab. (Our deadline to earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badges is still June 30 -- Learn2earn just provides a little extra incentive to get it done early!)

Investing in developing our teams and ourselves is one way we can make a difference. Ask yourself: Am I supporting an environment of Real-time development (RTD) within my team? Model the behavior of giving and receiving feedback with your teams and make it a daily habit. Not only will you feel good, but it fuels our emotional well-being, which positively impacts our performance. And be sure to celebrate successes and show appreciation along the way. Download the new RTD Engagement Team Toolkit from PwC’s App Store. The toolkit includes in-the-moment actions you can take at the start, middle and end of an engagement/project. Take this quiz to get a real-time reality check. Am I regularly initiating and acknowledging Snapshots? The mobile Snapshot app is designed to be initiated easily and quickly for on-the-go professionals. Your Snapshots should cover work done to-date and 80% of your hours at any point during the year. Keep your TalentLink profile up to date. As a reviewer, have I completed the Snapshots I’ve received? Open the menu (upper-left corner in the Snapshot app) where the "Snapshots to Complete" item will indicate how many Snapshots need to be completed. Consider setting up time with your reviewer or reviewee to complete a Snapshot together.

Read on for tips from the team to get the most out of our new client acceptance and engagement startup tool. Rapid Engage overlays our existing client and engagement acceptance systems (including A&amp;C, AFS, Create, myEngage and others), providing one interface that helps you complete required process steps and track your progress. Rapid Engage doesn’t change our existing client acceptance policies and procedures -- it just makes the entire process easier for you. Rapid Engage reminders: When will my opportunity appear in Rapid Engage? The tool launched in phases across the firm in August. From the date the tool launched to your business unit, any newly created opportunities that move beyond the “Target” stage in Salesforce will appear in Rapid Engage. If you’re a member of the opportunity team in Salesforce, those opportunities will be automatically displayed in your Rapid Engage landing page. They’re also viewable to anyone in the firm using the search bar. Start with the “Engagement Details.” Once an opportunity is in Rapid Engage, one of your first steps should be to provide basic information about the engagement and team in the “Engagement Details.” This info will then be used to auto-launch Engagement Acceptance Forms and Authorization for Services, as required. (You should no longer launch your own EAF or AFS.) Have a contract that originated outside of Create? For contracts or statements of work drafted outside of Create, our engagement letter creation system, reach out to "Ask OFRO" for assistance completing this step for now. Create will soon be enhanced to allow you to upload a signed document and complete the contracting step in Rapid Engage. We’re continuously improving processes behind the scenes. Rapid Engage has already enabled improvements. Learn more now about: How ADS requests are now initiated via Salesforce for new clients of the US and Mexico.

If you ever need more on our processes, check out the “Client &amp; Engagement” section of the One Firm Risk Organization portal.

In addition to having two daily habits — hydration and stepping away from the screen — the team is using Instagram to spotlight individual members and inspire others. “With 25 people on the team, we thought the daily, individual spotlights were a great way to build relationships by getting to know our colleagues on a more personal level,” team lead Kristin Szkrybalo said. “It’s amazing how you can work with people and sit in the same office, yet know only a few things about their work and personal life. The Instagram account has brought us closer together in a fun way.” When The habit refresher was first announced, the team quickly assembled to get a head start on their habits and build momentum before the official start in January. “We hold each other accountable through Instagram in an engaging way,” Kristin explains. “For example, to promote our hydration and stepping away from the screen habits, we post creative photos using the hashtag #HydrationHeroes.” After The habit refresher ends, the team plans to continue with their healthy daily habits and use of social media. They encourage others to set realistic well-being goals and support one another in finding balance. “It’s always busy,” Kristin said. “Taking care of your health should be a top priority. Your ability to perform at your best depends on it.” Follow the team on Instagram to see how they keep up their well-being habits and profile fellow PwCers. We hope their story inspires you to embrace Your Tomorrow. Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know!

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? Laura Didyk, Executive Assistant in Transaction Services in the New York office. I am retiring this month after 42 years with the firm. How would you describe your career journey at PwC? I joined PwC as a secretary in the Tax practice in 1976. The term executive assistant was not used at that time. I was recruited by PwC directly from secretarial school. My title was "manager's secretary." I reported to six managers and loved it. I switched from Tax to Transaction Services 28 years ago when the partner I supported moved to mergers and acquisitions. If you told me on my first day here that I would stay for 42 years I would have never believed it. But PwC is a place to truly grow your career, your knowledge -- and even your friendships! I’ve always appreciated the way you can take charge of your own career with the support of those around you. The people here have really made the difference for me. How has technology changed over the years, from your standpoint? The job I had when I first started would be unrecognizable today! Time and expense reports were done by hand -- and answering phones was a big deal in the days before voicemail. You had to write detailed messages on slips of paper. We used electric typewriters and carbon paper to make copies -- it was a highly intricate process. Tax returns were all completed manually back then, so we worked a lot of overtime filling them out from January to April 15. People recorded letters using dictaphone tape machines, for transcription at a later time. Or, they dictated letters and we used shorthand and typed it later. And, of course, there were no laptops back in those days. I’m impressed with the firm’s commitment to becoming more digitally fit -- it’s a very exciting time! What other notable changes have you seen? When I first joined, everyone got two weeks of vacation. That extended to three weeks after six years, and 22 days after 15 years of service. I've seen such a wonderful increase in benefits over the years with things like flextime, telecommuting and parental leave. Another good one: Before direct deposit, you picked up your paycheck from the cashier’s department. So, if you were going on vacation, you had to make arrangements to get your check ahead of time. We also had an airline department on premises that printed airline tickets for business trips. There were no security guards checking badges -- and no turnstiles in the lobby, you just walked right in! Overall, I love the changes and improvements that I’ve witnessed over the years. It’s been a home for me, and even though I will miss it, I’m looking forward to staying in touch with the wonderful friends I have made along the way. What are your plans for retirement? To do nothing for one month! After that, my husband and I are taking a cruise through the Panama Canal. It's a promise I made to him long ago; we are both very excited about it. Do you have a colleague or team that’s delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

Read more below to be sure you’re taking full advantage of all the things we’re doing to operate as One Firm, simplify and tech-enable our business, and develop the digital skills we need to succeed.When I look at all of the ways our IFS team contributes to PwC’s success, I’m tremendously proud. Thank you. You’re making a difference. I want to share an update on our Annual Performance Bonus program. Each year, we recognize your performance and contributions -- and give you the opportunity to share in the success of the firm -- by rewarding you for your impact as we all contribute to our One Firm strategy. As Tim mentioned, we expect to have another strong year if we deliver on Your Tomorrow. Your Total Rewards Summary in the Me@PwC app provides the target bonus ranges for your specific level within IFS -- as well as insight into the earnings potential across levels. The Me@PwC app is for US staff only; this app is not available to US partners or interns, residents of Puerto Rico and Mexico, or US staff on international assignment. PwC Mexico staff can view their Total Rewards Summary in Spark: Me@PwC Funding of the bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Paying at, above or below the bonus target ranges will be determined by whether we meet, exceed or fall short of our goals. Managing Directors will continue to have their own Annual Performance Bonus program, which will be communicated separately. In addition, I want to call your attention to some of the important things happening between now and the end of 2018: In the next few weeks, we’ll have news for you about an exciting new program: our IFS Leadership Milestone Experience. The next Firmwide Town Hall takes place Oct. 30 (check your calendar for the invite) -- please make it a priority to attend. We’ll be placing a hold on your calendar for our next IFS all-hands webcast, Dec. 5. I know we all enjoy getting together virtually a few times a year to focus on our work and people in IFS and I’m looking forward to connecting with you then. For the first time, this year Mexico will conduct mid-year reviews in their IFS functional areas, teamed up with the IFS People Team. Thank you again for all you’re doing to help drive our success -- for the contributions you’ve made so far this year and for the enthusiasm you’ve shown as we embark on our next steps. This is an exciting time for the firm and for all of us! In the meantime, please read on to see how we’re delivering against our FY19 goal of becoming a truly digital organization and be sure to take advantage of the many resources shared below. In FY19, PwC will realize our goal of becoming a truly digital organization -- and you play an important role. Let’s keep our focus on these three areas: Your work to embed One Firm behaviors and thinking across IFS and the firm makes clear that our strategy and the strength of our business matter to you. In my interactions with IFS teams over the last several months, I’ve seen firsthand how you’re breaking down silos and approaching challenges in new ways. Let’s keep it up! As you’re working on projects or process improvements, ask yourself if you’ve considered all of the lines of service and IFS in your planning, and whether there are ways to achieve even greater synergies. Promote the use of One Firm tools, like Salesforce, and delivery through our platforms. Check out the new IFS site to better connect across IFS teams. Remember that, regardless of your role, taking a One Firm approach will help you build relationships, grow your business acumen and enhance your development. Every day, our IFS teams are working across the firm to help deliver innovative solutions that provide greater value for our clients and a simplified experience for our partners and staff. The launches of Workday, the One Firm Risk Organization, Rapid Engage for client and engagement acceptance, our new SAP Concur Expense system, Mobile Only and contracting tools like Create and DocuSign are just a few examples of important initiatives that will free up time and make our lives easier. Be sure to take advantage of these as appropriate for your role, and encourage others to do so as well. Within each of our IFS functions, we should continue to identify processes that can be automated, streamlined or simplified. As Tim mentions, together we’ll bring Your Tomorrow to life in FY19. IFS already has 153 Digital Accelerators leading the way in taking IFS and the firm to the next level of digital enablement. And we have a number of exciting things on the horizon to further tech-enable our business and give each of us the opportunity to develop the digital skills we need to succeed. Digital Upskilling: The new Digital Hub (available for Mexico in 2019) houses everything you need to build your digital skills. There, our US team can find resources to help you reach the leaderboard in PowerUp!, insightful Tech While You Trek podcasts and more. Coming soon are informative Learning Bursts and details about our new, two-day Digital Academies (open to everyone!). Going long on data: Read more from Tim about how we’re putting data to work for our clients and our firm. That includes building a single global data platform, seeking permission from clients to use their data beyond a particular engagement to power innovation and issuing a new Client Data Use policy. Telling our Digital Story: Many of our people have asked for a tool to help explain to others -- friends, family, alumni, recruits and clients -- how we’re evolving as a digital firm. Our Digital Story can help you do just that. (Spanish version here.) Be well, work well is here to stay: Last week in the US, we began our FY19 well-being journey together with the first of four firmwide Be well, work well events this year -- PwC On the Move. Watch PwC Inside for updates (including the launch in Mexico!). And, for our US team, be sure to activate your Well-being Rewards account.

Plus, our new IFS site has a wealth of professional development resources.

Level-up your digital skills and conquer the first Digital Quest HQ News Dec. 7, 2018 At last week’s firmwide town hall, Tim Ryan outlined what’s next for all of us as we move forward on our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling journey. Starting today, we’re launching the first of four Digital Quests! Ready to get started? Test your digital knowledge by taking the first Digital Quest, the SquadFuel Project. It’s simple: Go to the Digital Hub on your laptop or mobile device and click on “Digital Quests.” As a firm, we’ve set an ambitious but achievable goal for everyone to complete all four Digital Quests by the end of FY19 (June 30, 2019) and earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. Learn more about the Digital Acumen knowledge badge and our Digital Badge Program. Each Digital Quest will take approximately 60 minutes to complete and is eligible for one CPE credit. A few things to know: You can start and stop the Digital Quest at any time, but you can’t go back. So before you click “Next,” be confident in your decision. There is a quiz at the end of each Digital Quest. You must get four out of five questions correct -- but if you don’t pass, don’t worry. You can brush up on your skills and take it again. How do I prepare for the Digital Quests? If you’ve been playing along with PowerUp!, listening to Tech While You Trek, and completing Learning Bursts, you’re on your way! You can also find learning resources specific to each Digital Quest on the Digital Quest page of the home of all things Digital Upskilling -- the Digital Hub. We know you have many things going on -- let’s all aim to complete the first Digital Quest by the end of December so we’ll be one step closer to earning our Digital Acumen knowledge badges! And get ready for the second Digital Quest, covering artificial intelligence, machine learning and data modeling, expected to be released next month. So head over to the Digital Hub today to continue developing important digital skills crucial to PwC, Your Tomorrow and all of us in our fast-paced and ever-evolving digital world.

IPS leadership joins the fight against hunger! Advisory - test April 29, 2019 Did you know that 40% of New York City (NYC) households lack the income needed to cover basic necessities like food, shelter and childcare? This sobering statistic prompted one of our vertical leadership teams to repurpose their evening activity, roll up their sleeves and take action. While gathered in NYC for their quarterly meeting, the Industrial Products &amp; Services Extended Leadership Team carved out time to help those in need. IPS Vertical Leader, Jenny Koehler, kicked-off the event with a heartfelt message that emphasized our firm’s values, and the importance of leading with a service-driven mindset. The team then headed to their workstations, turned up the tunes and worked together to produce over 500 brown bag snack packs! Shortly after the event, City Harvest, NYC’s largest food rescue organization, picked up the snack packs for distribution to youth and seniors throughout NYC.

Say it IS so! A deck with no words? Say it IS so! Advisory - test Aug. 31, 2018 They say a picture is worth a thousand words. The TMT staff council kept that saying in mind while “pitching” their FY19 TMT staff engagement initiatives to the TMT leadership team (LT) last month. As the team met, debated, discussed and planned how they could drive overall staff happiness and engagement this year, they also grappled with how they would pitch their ideas to the LT the following day. “We need to show the LT how all of these initiatives are intertwined,” said David Sapin, the Risk and Regulatory GTM leader for TMT who also happens to be the staff council’s partner sponsor (and huge proponent of the BXT philosophy). Realizing that the typical readout of tactics and next steps might fall flat, David continued, “What if you guys went in with NO words on slides and did it Pecha Kucha style?” The eyes of those in the room who had been through a BXT Accelerator lit up. Michael Callahan, TMT staff council lead and former BXT Accelerator winner, got the team quickly to work. He directed them to start snapping “action shots” of how their proposed initiatives would enhance the TMT culture from the staff’s perspective… not the logistics and level of detail they normally would draft. After a few quick practices (and a lot of laughs), the team huddled in an elevator ready to confidently tell their story. While they didn’t do a standard Pecha Kucha (which is 20 slides with no words timed to run every 20 seconds) their whole presentation was only 16 slides and took 15 minutes to present. “Leveraging Pecha Kucha allowed us to focus on the story instead of the slides,” said Robbie Voigtmann, Director on the Digital and Technology Innovation GTM team. “Instead of 30 slides and 55 minutes of presenting we had an interactive 15 minute presentation with 45 minutes of conversation!” Congrats to the TMT staff council for a successful meeting and best of luck with your change initiatives this year -- which were all approved!

Speed. Convenience. Consistency. Friendliness. And one big connector: human touch — that is, creating real connections by making technology feel more human and giving employees what they need to create better customer experiences. Our new “Experience is Everything” report shows that the stakes are high for getting experience right. We surveyed 15,000 consumers in 12 countries, who shared what it takes to deliver the kind of experience that keeps them satisfied and coming back. The results? One in three customers will leave a brand they love after one bad experience. Get experience right? Benefits include up to a 16% price premium. But there’s a clear gap between what consumers expect and what companies currently deliver. The challenge for companies: using new technology with purpose to make experiences feel more human — without creating frustrations for customers and while empowering employees.

We’re happy to report that on June 30, Melissa became the 175th person in the world to complete the Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming. By completing three impressive marathon swims totaling 69.7 miles, Melissa etched her name into the record books while also maintaining a full-time schedule at PwC. We caught up with Melissa for a chat about her Triple Crown victory. How did the firm’s Your Tomorrow strategy -- including Be well, work well and Digital Fitness -- support your pursuit for the Triple Crown? Your Tomorrow was a huge influence! Marathon swimming requires sacrifice in every aspect of your life and impacts all four dimensions of energy. Understanding how the four dimensions fuel well-being with Be well, work well helped make my journey possible. I was able to proactively communicate and execute a plan, which I worked on with my career coach, market leaders, engagement teams, clients and HR Talent Consultant to gain the flexibility needed to achieve my goals. Additionally, through the firm’s investment in technology, I was able to use many of the new PwC apps to work on-the-go. For example, I completed a Snapshot and synched my time on the apps before swim training and the start of the work day. Tech enablement at the firm has directly impacted my work-life balance for the better! Speaking of flexibility, what advice do you have for people who are still trying to make it work? Flexibility is different for everyone. Regardless of your desired arrangement, the key is to communicate your proposal and find a compromise that works for everyone. It didn’t happen overnight for me. I needed a plan with enough wiggle room to handle unforeseen changes in training, work and life. Project management was huge for me, because I was able to take what I learned at work to build a plan for my life, which largely included my swimming. What lessons did you learn in your journey that make you a better PwC professional? This is a great question and something I think about all the time. At PwC and in life, I think we are afraid of things like failure and poor decision-making. Achieving the Triple Crown has taught me that my investment in myself innately makes me a better worker because it has removed the fear of uncertainty and making mistakes. When that stress fueled by fear is removed, you can grow, learn and evolve and connect with others through your personal story. Fear of mistakes is often what separates us from achieving our true potential. Now that you’ve completed your Triple Crown, what’s next? I’m going to take a year off racing to relax, recuperate and focus on enjoying the water again! Training more than 35 hours a week, in addition to work, took a lot out of me mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. It can be easy to lose sight of why you do what you do, why you love your sport and the little things that make every day special. That’s why I’m just going to relax for the next year and swim for the joy of it. There are a few shorter swims I want to do next year -- Alaska, Hawaii, and Lake Tahoe -- but I’m not planning any big swims again until 2020. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: Talk with your teams about your well-being and flexibility needs, even during busy times. You don’t get it if you don’t plan for it, so hold one another accountable! Our Flexibility2 site provides tips and best practices. Melissa’s marathon swim training ground in the Puget Sound off Alki Beach in West Seattle, the water temperature ranges 45-58F year-round.

Desiree Martin del Campo is a prime example of how we bring this strategy to life through flexibility. Desiree never dreamed of completing a single marathon, let alone 50 half marathons. It all started in 2009 when Partner Andrew Gaudin noticed she was tracking calories on a sheet. Taking an interest in his colleague’s wellness goals, Andrew proposed they enter their names into the NYC Marathon lottery. Having never run a day in her life, Desiree was hesitant to say “yes”, but considering the low likelihood of winning the lottery and wanting to appease her partner, she accepted the offer. Little did she know, this was going to be the beginning of a life-altering journey that would take her through every state and each dimension of energy — physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. “The only time I ever ran was after an ice cream truck,” Desiree jokes. “Running was an activity that never appealed to me. The thought of running a marathon never entered my mind. But Andrew was so enthusiastic and determined, I couldn’t say no. I figured if it was meant to be, it would happen.” Desiree and Andrew were both selected serendipitously in the lottery. With only six months to train, Desiree had to make significant changes to her daily habits. “Training for a marathon takes an enormous amount of time and effort, especially when you’re as fast as a turtle,” Desiree jokes. “My team would allow me to work flexibly so that I could leave the office early to train. They also provided me protected time on Fridays which was tremendously helpful in trying to balance my professional and personal commitments. The daily runs during the week began to have a positive ripple effect on my life. For the first time ever, physical fitness was becoming a serious focus of mine.” After completing the NYC Marathon, Desiree felt inspired to continue running. In fact, she would go on to run nine half marathons by the end of 2010. It was at this point that Desiree decided to do one in every state. “Thanks to my colleagues and the firm’s flexibility, I was able to travel across the country,” she says. Ten years later, Desiree crossed her 50th state finish line at the Maui Ocean Front Half Marathon, accomplishing a goal she never dreamed of setting. “You’re never too old to try new things,” she advises. “Open yourself up to new experiences and lifestyles. There are plenty of people at the firm to support you along way. If I can do it, so can you!” Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know. Remember: Talk with your teams about your well-being and flexibility needs, even during busy times. You don’t get it if you don’t plan for it, so hold one another accountable. Our Flexibility2 and Be well, work well sites provide tips and best practices. Desiree jumps for joy after completing her 50th half marathon in Maui, Hawaii.

Each month we’ll recognize a member of our Tax practice who is living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” Shadel Cortorreal, Atlanta Tax Associate While everyone at PwC has been great, bringing me coffee, holding open doors, etc., Shadel Cortorreal has gone above and beyond. Shadel lives in midtown near me and we ride to the client site each day. When we arrive at the client, she gets my wheelchair out of the trunk, puts it together and pushes me to the audit room. When we leave, she pushes me to the car, helps me get in, and loads my wheelchair (sometimes the drivers don't even get out of their car or offer to help her.) On our way home, I get dropped off at my apartment first, so she unloads my wheelchair and puts it together and pushes me to the apartment lobby. I realize that I can make it to any client without help. However, I also realize that I benefit because Shadel is here to help. I don’t have to ask for her help, she just does it. In a world where people can sit by and do nothing, she does something and I am grateful. -Adam Felts, Associate Looking for more ideas on how to approach recognition?

The Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax earnings each pay period in a WageWorks account. In turn, you use these pre-tax dollars to pay for work-related transit and/or parking expenses. In fact, using pre-tax dollars for expenses you’re already paying for can save you up to 30% of your commuting costs because you save on federal taxes, state taxes (in most states) and FICA. 2019 monthly contribution limits The IRS governs pre-tax commuter benefits. For 2019, the pre-tax contribution limits are: $265 per month for transit expenses and $265 per month for parking expenses.You can start, increase, decrease or stop your contribution amount at any time throughout the year at wageworks.com. Maximum parking/transit account balance Starting on Mar. 1, parking and transit account balances at WageWorks will be limited to a maximum of $1,000. If you have both types of accounts, you can have $1,000 in each. Monthly payroll deductions will be stopped if your account balance(s) exceed the $1,000 maximum. You will then need to enroll in payroll deductions again, once your balance(s) are spent down. Learn more For more information about enrollment and eligible expenses, or to elect or change a contribution amount: Visit wageworks.com. Call WageWorks at 877-WageWorks (877-924-3967). Representatives are available Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. Review the Commuter Benefits Program Description. If you are logged into myKcurve, click here. The Commuter Benefits Program is available to active US staff receiving US pay only. The following are not eligible to enroll in the Commuter Benefits Program: interns and temporary employees, partners and principals, and staff of the Puerto Rico and Mexico offices. We strongly encourage Flexibility2TM Talent Network staff not to elect participation because of the timing of benefits. If elected, reimbursement generally can only be made for eligible expenses while employed with the firm. Any remaining funds are forfeited.

This is a big part of Your Tomorrow, and it’s something you’re going to see becoming a reality during FY19. As with everything we do, I want to make sure we all know why we’re doing this. It goes back to listening to our clients. They want more value -- and data is the fuel that drives innovation and value. It also goes back to listening to you. You want to develop skills that make you more valuable and, as we become world-class at using data, your value grows, too. To put it another way, our ability to put data to work is part of our plan to stay relevant and secure the future for our firm and all of us. So let me break down how we’re taking this big idea and making it real. To start, we're building a single, global data platform. Right now we have many different data repositories. With the new platform, we get the benefit of scale, a consistent approach across the firm and enhanced security. This platform will help us with our engagements. The tools we use every day, like Halo, Tableau and Alteryx, will be integrated with the platform. It will be faster and easier for us to acquire and work with data, to drive quality and uncover insights that add value for our clients. Building this platform also opens up massive opportunities for us. For example, with clients' permission (more on this below), we can securely store their data and combine it with data that we create, and third-party data. Over the next few years, we will bring that data together with advanced technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence, giving us the potential to innovate and create completely new service offerings. We're investing in building the data platform -- and in all of you, as well. Our ability to innovate with data is only possible if we have the skills needed to put this powerful platform to work. That's why digital upskilling is such an important part of Your Tomorrow. Of course access to data is critical, too, which is why we’re beginning to seek permission -- transparently -- from our clients to use their data beyond a particular engagement. With their permission, we can de-identify and securely store their data, obtained or developed during an audit, tax or consulting project; aggregate it with data from other clients, PwC’s data and third-party data; and use it in a controlled, secure manner to power innovation at PwC. The way we get agreement to use client data for secondary uses is to make it part of all of our engagement letters and Master Services Agreements. Starting now, our partners, and directors and managers who are helping to lead engagements, will discuss this with clients as we issue new contracts or when existing client contracts are up for renewal. Last, we’re issuing a new Client Data Use Policy. The updated policy outlines the guardrails in place to manage the risks that accompany secondary uses of data and -- importantly -- protects the confidentiality of our clients’ data. Handling client data securely and confidentially will always be our highest priority. This policy goes hand-in-hand with the capabilities of our new data platform, so that we continue to enhance our ability to handle data with care and integrity. So what does this mean for you? It means great opportunities to learn and grow -- and a few specific things we need you to do. If you have responsibility for client contracts or Master Services Agreements, please get educated on the new contract provision and the tools we have in place to support your discussions. Our Client Data Use site has a wealth of resources to support you, including videos, FAQs, and a document you can share with clients to explain how we use and protect their data. Our new One Firm Risk Organization and Chief Data Office are standing by to offer support. We need people who know how to handle data and use our tools to uncover new insights. From data academies to digital upskilling, many of us are on our journey to building new skills and many more will be developing these skills over the course of FY19. Get to know your role in treating client data with care and integrity. All of us will need to get familiar and comply with the new Client Data Use Policy. Team, we’ve already started this shift on data. To be clear, we already have teams doing great work with data; our goal, over time, is to pivot from doing this in pockets to using data at scale, across all parts of our business. So lean in and understand why this is important. We’ll be doing interesting work -- and meeting our clients’ demands for more value and a digital experience, too.

PwC’s independence gives our clients, our regulators and the public confidence in our ability to act with integrity, objectivity and impartiality. And failing to maintain independence can have serious consequences for you as an individual, the firm and our clients. That’s why it’s on each of us to stay current with our independence policy. Check out our overview below highlighting updates to PwC’s US Independence Policy and consider whether these updates have an impact on you. Then, visit the fully revised US Independence Policy on our new One Firm Risk Organization portal for full details. And see our One Firm Risk Organization Independence page if you have any questions. New policy on use of client data for internal or commercialization purposes. This new firm policy (adopted in USIP in August 2018) provides guidance around when and how we can re-use client data obtained when providing an audit or non-audit service. See USIP 6000.5. Revised policy on approving Authorisation for Services (AFSs) for new fund audit clients. Where a partner on a new fund audit in an existing fund audit client group is also the group audit engagement partner (or partner in charge of the investment company complex), AFS approval for the audit is not required, subject to certain criteria. SeeUSIP 4060.11. Clarified policy on timing of PCAOB Rules 3524/3525 audit committee pre-approval. The requirements of PCAOB Rules 3524 and 3525 must be fulfilled at the same time as audit committee pre-approval is obtained for the underlying services. See USIP 4100.32. Revised guidance on analyzing the permissibility of investing in non-audit clients. See USIP 5390.1. See our One Firm Risk Organization Independence page if you have any questions. For a complete list of changes made to our US Independence Policy since the last update, see the Revision Table of changes at Section 10000 of USIP or access redlined versions. For a link to the "track-change" and "clean" versions of the updated policy, see the US Independence Policy on the OFRO Portal.

So many of you have told me that when you look at the world today you feel a growing sense of urgency and drive to help others facing tragedy, hardship and inequality. We're fortunate to be part of an organization that is investing to create opportunities for today and for the future. The forces of change that we’re responding to are also widening the gap between those who have opportunities and those who do not. As a purpose-led, values-driven organization, we have the ability -- and responsibility -- to “mind the gap” and address it by giving and working for change together. We do not do this alone. I’m so proud of the difference we make as we give through Impact Space. Year-round, tens of thousands of us collectively contribute more than $35 million to causes we care about, showing our communities, our colleagues and our clients how we live our values. Those dollars translate to caring: $415,000 supporting each other’s crowdfunders, over $1 million helping rebuild communities devastated by last year’s hurricanes and wildfires, and $12 million addressing inequity in youth education. Those are just some examples from 2017 alone. Giving back to our communities and society is a core part of our PwC culture and purpose, and your generosity and leadership make our firm stand apart. No matter the size of your donation, giving back is something you can do right now -- and it takes just a few moments -- to put your personal values of caring and making a difference into immediate action.

You see SLAN uses Excel spreadsheets to manage configuration data before uploading en masse into the application. The team recognized right away that the amount of repetitive manual Excel activities not only increased chances of human error, but also exposed the project to timeline delays. “The solution was looking us dead in the eye,” said Manish Dharnidharka, TMT Advisory partner on the project, “but the problem was, no one on our team had the time or the full knowledge to build a solution themselves.” “We reached out to some contacts we had on the Digital Lab team, explained our problem and we quickly got to work,” added Richard Cebula, managing director in our TMT vertical. Digital Lab Solution With the help of Mike Huwyler and Joe Kressler, the Digital Lab team helped build two apps/tools: A data transformation process flow that would take one “golden company code” and apply the same configuration for the remaining 121 company codes in each of the 52 tabs in the SLAN Excel template. A process automation (bot) that took individual pieces of configuration data from the SLAN Development environment and applied it into the SLAN Excel template for the next environment (Test or Production) The Win By using data analysis and automation on this engagement, the following benefits were realized: Time saved. The data transformation process flow ran in under five minutes for an activity that would have taken a human 16 hours; not only on time, but every time a configuration update was required by the client. The automation program ran in under 10 minutes for an activity that would have taken a day or more to do at least 4x (1x for each environment). Overall saving 160+ man-hours. Accuracy. By using process automation, the project team avoided any human error that would have resulted in 60+ hours of error resolution and correction. Re-use. These applications can be reused on other Nakisa projects in the future.

Since our business is strong, we’ve increased the bonus pools for this year by 10%, giving leaders a larger pool of resources to recognize individual contributions. The 10% uplift doesn’t mean individual bonuses will necessarily increase by 10%. It means that during Career Roundtables, as our leaders invest in understanding your individual performance and impact, they will have a larger pool of resources to reward differentiated performance.

When it comes to traveling -- by car, train or plane -- it can be stressful. Frequent travel can lead to a poor diet and lack of exercise, while the side effects of jet lag can include mood changes, disturbed sleep and daytime fatigue, all of which can affect job performance. Here are tips to help manage your energy while traveling. Start your trip as well rested as possible. If you are over-tired, stressed, or under the weather before the flight, chances are good that jet lag will catch up with you. Always pack “hangry” snacks. Stock up on healthy snacks such as fruit, protein bars or trail mix, so if your flight is delayed or you’re sitting on the tarmac, you can refuel. See our nutrition guide for healthy snacking tips. Stay hydrated during the flight by choosing water (vs. soda, caffeine or alcohol). This combats the dry cabin air that can cause headaches and dry out the eyes and nasal passages -- the ideal conditions for catching colds or other viruses. Do some simple stretches in your seat to keep circulation moving. Instead of working the entire time on the plane or train, work in 90-minute sprints. Then recover mentally for 20-30 minutes by reading a favorite book, flipping through a magazine or practicing mindfulness. When you’re away from home, exercise for at least 20 minutes in the morning. If you don’t do it then, you probably won’t get to it. If there’s no gym in the hotel or nearby, no stairs to walk or run, and you can’t go outside, simply do some exercises in the room: yoga poses, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges or jumping jacks. Try to eat the same healthy foods you eat at home. And if you travel frequently, you can’t think of eating on the road as “treating” yourself -- because it’s your normal routine. Read Fuel your body with the right stuff. Commit to your desired sleep routine. If you normally go to sleep at 11 p.m., don’t stay out past 11 or work through the evening until 11 just because you’re away from home. Try to do things that are as close to your normal or desired habits as possible. Bring along ear plugs or download a white noise app – such as White Noise Lite – from PwC’s App Store to block out noise, call a loved one, practice that hobby or explore the local area. During your meetings, make sure you take short, intentional breaks, even if it’s just to take three deep breaths or do some simple stretches in your chair. If you can get up, take a walk or get a nutritious snack. The key is to take regular breaks and use them to energize you. You can prioritize your well-being even while traveling -- better yet, try it with your teams and let us know how it’s going. Keep an eye out for additional resources. Visit Be well, work well for more information on managing your energy. Director Cecilia Tse keeps up with her yoga on the road...even in tight spaces.

Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. The Tax Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains links to the templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a Privacy Notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period, provides any tax service to a person in a FROR at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a FROR in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)).

The Checklist will still be available as a reference tool for clients and PwC teams to assess if the client has engaged in a reportable transaction. It can be found at the following LINK. Upon request from a client, engagement teams can provide a copy of the Checklist to assist clients. External reporting requirements for both clients and PwC have not changed. Clients must disclose their participation in any reportable transaction and PwC must register any reportable transaction when PwC is a Material Advisor. As part of preparing a tax return, you still must advise your client regarding their responsibilities around reportable transactions.

Quality is foundational to all that we want to accomplish in our strategy, and it enables us to drive our Your Tomorrow agenda forward. In FY20, we’re focused on bringing business-led and citizen-led innovation to life through our continued efforts to tech-enable our services and leverage our new digital skills on our own teams. And as we progress on this journey, it’s important that we are leading differently and engaging everyone on a deeper level. To do this effectively, we will be holding webcasts to outline our strategic priorities and explain your role in accelerating our future in the months ahead. If you’re in Core Assurance, you’ll also experience Your Tomorrow Live! events across the country this summer, which are designed to show you how our audit engagements will be different moving forward. And if you’re in our Specialty Assurance Businesses, you’ll hear more in the coming months on how Your Tomorrow is enabling digital upskilling and the client experience for both audit and non-audit accounts. You’ll receive calendar invites from your respective leaders soon. The months ahead are full of exciting opportunities that I hope will make you feel energized about our journey and confident about where we’re heading as a practice, whether you’re serving our audit or non-audit clients. Thanks for everything that you do. Quality is foundational to all that we want to accomplish in our strategy. Here are some helpful resources to continue to enhance quality on your engagements: Questions about your annual training requirements? Our 2019 mandated curriculum for Core Attest, Risk Assurance and PCS is now available. ICYMI: The latest policy, guidance and audit guides to help you prepare for 2019 audits. Plus, check out Inform for more on adoption of ASC 326, credit losses, and the PCAOB’s staff guidance to support implementation of CAM reporting. Our ASM&amp;T Q1 webcast was mandatory for certain groups. Be on the lookout for the CPE eligible replay version in April. The deadline for completion of this mandatory training is May 31. All Risk Assurance professionals who support Core Attest engagements are required to attend the ASM&amp;T Quality webcast for Risk Assurance Professionals Supporting Financial Statement/Integrated Audit Engagements on June 18. For those serving non-audit clients: Is your work related to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)? It’s not always obvious. To know for sure, you must examine the proposed scope, the entity for which the services would be provided, and the client’s controls environment. These services could be considered audit, non-audit, or both, impacting which engagement letter to use, required approvals (e.g., PCAOB Rule 3525), and how the services should be documented. Our 2017 PCAOB inspection report was released on March 28. Risk Assurance launched new risk messaging in the marketplace and updated its go-to-market strategy to drive pipeline. Click here to learn more. These GEPs are taking new roles in Assurance. As we communicated in December 2018, the PwC global network will move to five consistent staff levels across all territories and lines of service, effective July 1, 2019. If you have any questions, please refer to the Assurance FAQs. Revenue results in Assurance are close to budget through March. Specific to our business units, Transaction Services (CMAAS and Valuations) are above budget, while Core, PCS and Risk Assurance are ahead of prior year results but behind budget through March. FY20 annual pricing is now available in EMT for Assurance. Several other important improvements went live in early March. Refer here for details. We are now offering a centralized billing and collections process to help streamline the work you do around billing and collecting. You can find additional details on the B&amp;C Spark Page including a replay of our training session. Our non-audit practices, including Risk Assurance, TS and FS BAS will move to Flex Forecast this summer. Stay tuned for training and rollout details coming soon. Effective March 1 2019, we updated our primary credential policy. Are you involved in selling new work? Be sure you’re using Rapid Engage, which will streamline the client and engagement setup process. Access the tool here, and learn all about it here. At our recent xLoS partner meeting, Tim Ryan asked all of our partners to sit down individually with their teams to talk about how we can bring our Your Tomorrow skills and tools to life in order to enhance quality and efficiency on our engagements. If you haven’t heard about your team’s Your Tomorrow execution plan yet, ask your partner. Here’s an update on our progress with citizen-led innovation: We asked engagement teams to identify and track repetitive activities during busy season that could be automated to further enable quality and improve efficiency using new technologies. To date, we’ve received roughly 3,000+ ideas for automation! Here’s how you can help bring those ideas to life. Risk Assurance has also been sourcing ideas to bring Your Tomorrow to life -- they’ve gathered 500 submissions via Idea Lab Challenges and citizen-led launch packs. Are you on track to help us meet our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal and earn your Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30?

It’s full speed ahead as staff continue to focus on their digital upskilling in 2019, and across the firm we’re seeing our people bring their digital acumen to life. But getting started with new and emerging digital technologies can feel overwhelming. You probably have many questions. How are we going to do this? When is the right time to get started? Who will help lead the effort? How will this impact our client work? The Digital Accelerators (DAs) in the Private Company Services (PCS) group had an idea for helping PCS Tax partners and staff get familiar with digital tools and technology and, more importantly, how to use them on client engagements. In order to successfully implement digital tools, the PCS Tax DAs wanted to take a step back, look at the processes being used, and evaluate where technology could automate those processes and improve how engagement teams worked. To achieve this goal, DAs in PCS Tax started conducting process improvement (Pi) sessions in October with each PCS Tax partner and their engagement teams. By the end of the year, they conducted Pi sessions in 45 cities and assisted more than 90 PCS engagement teams. With this personalized approach, the DAs helped teams look for pain points and identify digital solutions — demonstrating where technology could help, seeing if solutions existed in Digital Lab, or identifying where an Alteryx workflow or Bot could solve problems. “Going through the processes and thinking of different or better ways to get the work done has helped teams to identify some ‘quick-wins’ from Digital Lab and break down the barrier to getting started,” said PCS Tax DA Mark Krzeczowski. The Pi sessions helped drive excitement and energy in the markets. “It’s not often that you get the entire engagement team (including the partner) to sit down and talk through the current process of an engagement,” said PCS Tax DA Ryan McConaghy, “These open dialogue discussions helped teams identify areas for time savings by just rethinking how we approach the engagement.” The response to the Pi sessions has been extremely positive as teams have been able to get a better feel for technology and the benefits of using it on engagements. PCS Tax partner, Marissa Nelson commented, “The process improvement session we had helped me and my team identify where the inefficiencies in our processes were and align technology solutions with those processes to help significantly reduce time spent.” Find out more about the PCS Tax Digital Accelerator Team and what they’re up to on their Google site.

Tim Ryan talks audit, consulting mix and Need a business acumen boost? Tim Ryan talks audit, consulting mix and more on Bloomberg HQ News March 12, 2019 We see change all around us — at work, at home and at our clients. In this environment, our clients want to know our view on where industries are going, how fast technology is moving and what they should be doing to respond. Tim Ryan shared his view on some of these issues in two recent interviews with Bloomberg. Recently, Tim talked about the findings from PwC’s CEO Survey on Bloomberg with David Westin. While CEOs are cautious about the economy, they are optimistic about investing in their own businesses and in the future of how they will work. Digitization, AI and robotics are just some of the ways companies are dealing with the economic uncertainty. Our own upskilling journey is an example of how we’re also responding to the forces of change — and sharing our experiences is a good starting point for client conversations. Tim also spoke to Bloomberg Tax about PwC’s future — and that of the profession. As you may have seen in the headlines, the audit industry has recently been under scrutiny in the UK. While we are not hearing a lot of questions in the US, we all should be prepared to speak to the role audit firms play in the marketplace. With our One Firm approach, many of us contribute more broadly to the quality the firm delivers — we should be ready to tell our story proudly and be prepared to explain the value of our multidisciplinary approach.

Consider a wellness checku Want to jump start your well-being journey? Consider a wellness checkup National Benefits Feb. 11, 2019 Regular health exams are important. Even if you feel fine, the tests, screenings and discussions you have with your doctor can help detect problems early -- and could identify potential issues -- so you can take steps to prevent a serious health condition before it starts. If you’re enrolled in the PwC UnitedHealthcare (UHC) medical plan, you may choose to have your personal physician or EHE perform your preventive physical examination. Preventive exams performed by EHE or by an in-network doctor are 100% covered by the UHC medical plans through UHC.* If you’re not enrolled in a PwC medical plan, your medical care coverage likely includes a preventive exam (your out-of-pocket cost will depend on the provisions of the plan you are covered by). Using EHE for your preventive exam EHE is a premier physical exam provider that provides one-stop preventive care. When you use EHE, your examination will include a wide range of screening tests tailored to your age, gender, family history, risk factors and other individual needs. There are no claim forms, deductibles, copays or coinsurance. Ongoing support from EHE health mentors -- Plus, you’ll receive 12 months of personal health coaching, where you’ll have access to health mentors who work with you to build a personalized action plan for year-round well-being. To learn how EHE benefited PwC Talent Acquisition Leader, Dustin Bartolomeo-Damon, read his story here. Who is eligible for EHE and how can you schedule an appointment? If enrolled in the PwC UHC plan on the date of your exam, you and your spouse/domestic partner may take advantage of EHE. Individuals who are at least age 30 may visit EHE once per plan year at no cost (10 months must elapse between EHE exams) while those under age 30 may take advantage of the no-cost visit once every three years. Schedule your EHE appointment by calling (800) 362-8671; professional resource directors are available Monday-Friday, from 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Or schedule your appointment online at www.eheandme.com. If eligible to participate in a PwC UHC medical plan option but not enrolled, you and your spouse/DP may still utilize EHE. However, you must pay the full cost of the exam at the time of your visit and submit a claim to your health carrier for a level of reimbursement. For more details about EHE for staff, click here. Get $50 from the Well-Being Rewards Program for completing your exam The Well-Being Rewards Program provides an added incentive -- you can earn $50 per plan year just by undergoing a preventive exam. Remember, you’ll need to enter your exam details in the Virgin Pulse site via your desktop in order to claim your $50. * Note: Charges for care and services prescribed beyond the scope of eligible preventive care will be subject to your medical plan’s cost-sharing provisions.

From the Internet of Things (IoT), to process automation, to robotics, the convergence of human capability and digital potential continues to create new opportunities, as well as challenges. To help our clients prepare for these market forces, we launched an integrated, One Firm campaign this week around this Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), designed to help organizations rise above uncertainty and be prepared to become #4IReady. We are well positioned to help clients put the right strategy in place, harness human-insight experience, identify the right technology, and foster a workforce culture that’s focused on growth and adoption. The topic was front and center at the World Economic Forum in Davos a few weeks ago, and took center stage this week in Barcelona as part of our presence at Mobile World Congress, the world’s largest mobile event. This is a huge opportunity to bring our One Firm resources to help our clients, in appropriate ways, deal with the implications and opportunities arising from all the changes happening around them and confidently move forward. It’s also an opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in digital transformation. In addition to our #4IReady web presence, social media, press, videos and bylines, the campaign will feature content in Bloomberg and Quartz throughout the spring. How you can help spread the word There are important — and different — benefits for bringing our 4IR capabilities to our audit and non-audit clients. For audit clients, the focus will be on education and driving awareness of this seismic shift in how we live and work (and even play). It also ushers in a revolution of experience. And in the non-audit context, 4IR will help us empower leading organizations to intelligently apply technology to solve important business challenges. It’ll drive innovation and new business opportunities, while decreasing costs and increasing efficiencies and productivity to rise above current market volatility and predicted economic downturn. Get up to speed with the resources below and talk to your leaders about the best way to bring insights to the clients you serve. Read our point of view on our new 4IR webpage. For clients outside the US, there will also be a landing page on the Global PwC website. Discuss our PoV with your clients and see what issues we may be able to help them solve. Our Integrated Solutions address many of the challenges they will incur. Learn how our platforms, lines of service and sectors align to assist our non-audit client base. This is a One Firm approach, bringing capabilities from across the firm to address issues in a differentiated way for our non-audit clients. Learn more about how our platforms align with helping our clients respond to 4IR.

What we’re hearing from our leaders in Barcelona “It is just amazing to be here this year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona witnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution in play. Massive innovation -- companies from the telecommunications world, banking, financial services and automotive sectors are all here trying to understand what it means to be ready for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. How they need to innovate, not only on the product side but also innovate on the business model side.” - Mohamed Kande, Vice Chairman and US Advisory Leader (check out his video on Twitter @PwCUS) “It’s still very early to talk about the policy decisions that may be made around the 4IR, but we believe it’s important for businesses to take a do-it-yourself approach and begin to establish some boundaries for how to innovate responsibly.” - David Sapin, Risk &amp; Regulatory Platform Leader Questions?

As we approach 12/31 year ends, the TEA team has compiled a TEAm Readiness Checklist that provides general and solution specific (i.e., FSLI) tips on working with CoEs. This checklist includes steps teams should consider when working with CoEs to continue enhancing quality and simplifying and standardizing activities for efficiency, when appropriate. If you’re not using a CoE for the upcoming cycle, make sure you read this document to prepare for 2019. And even if you are, we encourage you to take a look as you might find the information helpful. The guidance focuses on key areas, including: General COE Participation Tips These helpful tips are not specific to any particular CoE but best practices for our engagements and for working effectively with a CoE. Launch Documents Launch Documents highlight the scope of the CoE’s testing for the 2018 audit cycle, in addition to other key information. These are live documents that will be updated for 2019 as the scope of work for each CoE evolves over time. Solution Tips Helpful tips have been accumulated for the 11 Solutions based on proof of concept and pilots executed over the course of the past 18 months. It is important to be aware of these tips for your future experience with a CoE. Note that some of these are required for participation in a particular CoE.

It actually happened in real life -- and to two of our own. Partner Chad Leopard, based in Dallas, and Manager Matt Hill, based in Washington, DC, both chose to spend the week of the firm shutdown in Haiti. Each traveled with their respective churches as volunteers for Mission of Hope, a group dedicated to supporting Haitians in the areas of health, infrastructure and spirituality. The two men did not know each other at the start of the trip; by happenstance, they met toward the end of the week in a way neither will forget. Political unrest in Haiti The week went as planned and was rewarding and productive for both men and their respective mission groups. They relished the chance to make a difference in the Haitian community by improving living conditions and providing guidance to Haitian youth to help the local churches better meet the needs of the villagers. But on Friday they learned of protests and demonstrations in Port-au-Prince, an hour and a half from where the Mission of Hope volunteers were staying. The cause: a dramatic spike in fuel taxes. “The Haitian government subsidizes fuel prices,” Chad explained, “so when these subsidies were lifted it prompted skyrocketing prices, making it unsustainable for the low-income inhabitants in this already cash-strapped nation.” While the increases were quickly suspended, it was too late to subdue the civil unrest that had already ensued. “It was intense,” said Matt. “We heard about barricades, looting and protestors blocking the streets.” “Mission of Hope assured everyone that we were safe inside the fully guarded compound, but it soon became clear that evacuation would be needed,” said Chad. Instant friends While waiting to evacuate, conversations among the group became the wellspring of critical connections. "During one such exchange, a woman from my group said that she just met another man from PwC on the trip,” said Chad. They became an instant team -- helping others as much as they could. "I also ran into the daughter and son of one of my best friends growing up in Alabama,” Chad said. “What are the odds? Their dad felt comforted that their kids knew someone else at the Mission at this time of crisis." The great escape: PwC to the rescue The plan was to leave for the airport at 4 a.m on Saturday. "But Mission of Hope couldn’t verify our safety in terms of whether the roads were clear of protestors or if the airport was even open,” said Matt. To help assist their respective groups, Matt and Chad began creating a contingency plan. “We called our airlines and US governmental officials for assistance,” said Chad. “And then I called my EA Glenda McDonald. She was actually at church at the time, but luckily answered her phone anyway.” Glenda contacted Partner Nikki Parham and Texas Market Managing Partner Scott Moore. “Scott contacted Director Tim Redding of PwC's Crisis Management and US Security team, who became the main contact for Matt and me,” said Chad. Tim provided a crisis team service representative at Amex travel to work on flight arrangements for both men. He also got in touch with US government officials in Haiti. In the midst of it all, Chad and Matt tried to help the rest of the volunteers in any way they could. The next big challenge was how to get to the airport safely. Armed guards, protestors, airport chaos They finally got the all-clear, and Chad’s group was the first to arrive at the airport in an armed bus caravan. The trip to the airport was stressful due to remnants of turmoil along the way, including road blockage, burned-out trucks and looters. “The airport was a total zoo; I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Chad. Amid the chaos, Chad had trouble getting his group through immigration and customs. PwC to the rescue once again. “Raquel from Amex worked her magic,” Chad said. “She got the airline to hold the flight until our group successfully checked in.” Chad was the last person to board the plane. “I held my breath until take off,” he said. “It was an overall harrowing and humbling experience.” Matt’s group made it out safely the next day. “With five minutes’ notice, we boarded a school bus to the airport, accompanied by armed guards, driving past protesters and barricades,” said Matt. Ultimately, all of the Mission of Hope volunteers and staff successfully evacuated Haiti. Home safely, thanks to teamwork Back on US soil, both men credit PwC for saving the day. “The response from the firm was instantaneous,” said Matt. “The help we received was very encouraging and comforting.” Chad agreed. “They were supportive and in touch with us constantly.” US Security’s Tim Redding said there were several ways his team helped. “We kept them aware of current news reports, shared solid intel and travel logistics, and reassured them that our government contacts in Haiti were ready to step in if necessary.” And when in doubt before, during or after a trip -- or for any reason -- feel free to call the PwC Emergency Hotline. “We provide consultation for any international trip, whether business or pleasure. We can tell you what to plan for and what to expect.” Chad and Matt agreed that being in constant contact with PwC really made a difference. We think Chad and Matt made a difference, too. They dedicated their week-long break to helping the Haitian community and then continued to help their fellow volunteers during a harrowing ordeal. ********************************************************************************************************************************************** To speak with a US Security team member, call the PwC Emergency Hotline at: 888-755-1515 (within the US) or 1-813-351-6460 (outside the US).

US Air Force uniform “We are IFS” focuses on inspiring stories from our IFS colleagues. Marie Reynaud, a senior associate based out of the Tampa office, can’t stop gushing about her love of the military. “It’s just in my blood,” she said. Her role as a recruiter on PwC’s Talent Acquisition team helps foster her devotion and involves representing the firm at local military organizations and US Air Force bases. “We love to recruit veterans and their spouses,” she said. “I’m proud to be with such a military-friendly firm.” Marie and her team are also dedicated to helping those with a military background transition to civilian careers. “When they join the firm, they need help learning the culture and typical office routines,” she said. “We help them do that -- and we also speak at local military events to spread the word that not only is PwC a great place to work, but a welcoming one for those coming from the military.” Recruiting for military veterans is a perfect match for Marie; she’s a veteran herself, having served in the Air Force for 20 years before coming to PwC in 2011. “The Air Force was my first job out of high school,” she said. “I served as a morse code operator, dental assistant, commander’s aid and photographer.” But it’s her last military role that stands out the most: She was the first female Air Force recruiter, a role she was in for 12 years. It’s no surprise she found her job at PwC while attending a recruiting event. “After serving three months as a contractor, I was hired as a full-time recruiting associate,” she said. “The firm appreciated my involvement with the military community and how that lifeline could support PwC’s goals of attracting veterans and their families.” It’s a family affair for Marie, too. “My husband Roy and I are ‘ambassadors’ for an organization of local military parents,” she explained. “My youngest son is in the Air Force; we like to give back.” Staying active in PwC’s Veterans Affinity Network (VAN) is another way Marie gives back. “We donate stocking stuffers to the military community at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa during the holidays and collect back-to-school supplies for their dependent children and care packages for the local troops, in addition to volunteering at local military career fairs,” she said. At VAN meetings, and on Veterans Day, Marie can be seen proudly wearing her uniform as she hands out flags and lunch tickets to our PwC vets. “My original uniform still fits!” Marie’s dedication extends beyond the military; she enjoys participating in the Reading Pals program through PwC’s Access Your Potential®, too. “I volunteer once a week,” she said. “Some of the kids couldn’t read when I first met them. There’s nothing better than seeing their faces light up the first time they finish a chapter on their own. It’s very rewarding.” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

The WEF and participants support international collaboration as a way of solving critical global challenges, with this year’s gathering focused on “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World.” Business leaders held strategy sessions on the hottest topics on the minds of CEOs today, from preparing the workforce for the jobs of the future to planning for risks like cybersecurity threats. Tim Ryan was on the ground to represent PwC US as our 21st annual Global CEO Survey was released. Watch this video for his three takeaways from the week, and read on below for a peek at his calendar, photos from a busy week in the Swiss Alps and insights you can share with your clients and network. On Monday, PwC launched its Annual Global CEO Survey. Tim Ryan, Global Chairman Bob Moritz and UK Chairman Kevin Ellis presented the results to World Economic Forum attendees in Davos. CEOs are the most optimistic they’ve been about the global economy since the 2008 recession. Here’s where you can access global survey findings:www.pwc.com/ceosurvey (download the PDF or Digital version) On Wednesday, PwC hosted a cocktail and dinner reception, where our leaders discussed the results of our CEO Survey with our clients and guests. You can be part of the conversation, too. Our 2018 Executive Dialogues Deck and talking points present US findings in an executive-level supplement that is easy to customize for meetings. (Visit our US CEO Survey on Spark for more resources.) Tim spoke on a Wall Street Journal Panel, “Business Over Bias” Tim spoke alongside business leaders from Procter &amp; Gamble and Microsoft about how to identify the sources of bias and prevent it. Tim found time to share his thoughts in 2 blog pieces Tim covers some of the key topics that came up at Davos -- and advocates for US organizations to invest in people and digital, backing his call with findings from the 21st CEO Survey. He also wrote about US infrastructure improvements on the WEF Blog. It was a busy week for our leaders at Davos. The only thing that could top the incredible discussions they had is this view.

But stepping away from the screen to prioritize well-being is a habit they’ve been implementing for quite some time. Two years ago, senior associate Kate Baron started an office kickball team and joined a local league. The idea was met with enthusiasm by her colleagues. “Everyone was excited to network outside the office while engaging in a healthy activity,” said Kate. “We were quickly able to create a One Firm team of 20 people with varying skill levels. Even some of our clients joined.” After one season, the team took a lengthy hiatus. But last year, Lindsey Haynes was inspired by Be well, work well to reunite the team. Despite a less-than-stellar record, the team had such a great time they continued to play and even ventured into dodgeball and flag football. They set up practice sessions on the weekends to prepare for games. “We may be in the midst of a losing streak,” Kate joked. “But it’s all about the bonding experience. Being able to disengage from work and connect with colleagues has made a noticeable difference in everyone's energy.” In addition to playing sports to boost energy, the team engages in various Digital Upskilling challenges, like PowerUp! and Learn2earn. “We’re a competitive bunch,” Lindsey admitted. “Everyone wants to win PowerUp! Some of our teammates have already completed the first two Digital Quests and leveraged bots in Digital Lab for the Learn2earn challenge.” Follow the Seattle Super Stars on Instagram to see how they keep up their well-being habits and Digital Upskilling. We hope their story inspires you to embody our Your Tomorrow strategy. Do you have a Be well, work well or Digital Upskilling story to share? Let us know!

As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The time is always right to do what is right.” Because you asked how PwC could do the right thing and be a leader, we’ve taken action to make our firm and communities places where we all feel a sense of belonging. And we’ve seen that when we ask others to join us, the impact is even greater. Last month, more than 150 companies followed our example and held Day of Understanding discussions about race and inclusion -- and the number of calls, texts and emails I’ve received from CEOs thanking us for our leadership has been inspiring. We also launched an amazing tech-enabled bus that is traveling the country and raising awareness of unconscious bias. And inside PwC, more than 15,000 of our directors and managers took part in training last month to help them be more inclusive leaders. These are great examples of what it means to be purpose-led and values-driven -- but while we can feel proud, we won’t stop trying to get better. As we observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, it’s a good time to think about how we continue to take steps that make a difference and inspire others to join us. As individuals, we can do something right now by taking the I Act On pledge. This effort, led by CEO Action for Diversity and InclusionTM, encourages individuals to pledge to check their unconscious biases, speak up for others and show up for all. We can also put our commitment into action by learning more through ourOutsmarting Human Minds podcast, getting involved in our Inclusion Networks with PwC, or continuing to have open conversations with others around us. You have my commitment that we’ll continue to work hard as a firm to become even more inclusive. Following up on the sessions for our managers and directors, we’ll continue the conversation around inclusive leadership with the rest of our team in the months ahead. Whether we’re talking to our client or our friends, we can also share with pride what our firm is doing and how we’re making a difference and driving real change in society. Even if our clients are not part of CEO Action, they can benefit from the ideas and resources of the CEO Action site and take part in the I Act On pledge. Thank you for doing what is right and making a positive impact with our colleagues and our communities as you go about your work. I’m proud of this team and how we bring our values and those of Dr. King to life each day.

As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors, and IFS directors with five or more years of service, are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to unwind, recharge and truly focus on their well-being through Be well, work well -- a key component of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Sometimes it’s the simplest things in life that are the best. Just ask senior manager Robyn Hunter, who recently took a sabbatical that was the opposite of radical. Instead, it was a simple and rewarding experience. “Ever since I became a working mother six years ago, I never had an extended period of uninterrupted time with my family,” Robyn reflected. “I was constantly multitasking between work and home. A staycation sabbatical was an opportunity to be fully immersed in my personal life.” Robyn intentionally chose to take her sabbatical at home. Spending quality time with her husband and children allowed her to make the most of the experience. Most importantly, Robyn was able to renew her energy. “My mental state significantly improved during the sabbatical,” she explained. “I was able to focus on one thing at a time and learned the valuable lesson that multitasking truly is a myth.” The time off had an impact on her family, as well. “Toward the end of my sabbatical I realized the positive impact it had on my mental state,” she said. “My interactions with family members were so much better. I was living in the moment. They noticed the difference, and it meant something to me.” Robyn has advice for those planning a sabbatical -- regardless of what they decide to do with the time: “I selected a quieter time in our fiscal year (August). Communicate your plans with your clients and team, and make sure everyone is comfortable and aware of expectations. That will also reduce the likelihood that they'll need to contact you when you're away.” Visit our Rewards Strategy site to read more about sabbaticals and learn about PwC's Career Milestone program.

Here’s how some PwCers are making a difference with Digital Lab From binders to bots: As members of the Quantitative Solutions &amp; Technologies group, Managing Director Tyler Whately and Manager Jarrod Mead are delivering national trainings to support the adoption of workflow and visualization tools by staff and clients. Despite their traditional tax accounting backgrounds, they recognize that how they look at and analyze data has significantly changed. “When I started with the firm in 2013, we were still using paper binders,” said Jarrod. “That wasn’t that long ago. Today, I’m helping clients see the value of using workflows, visualizations and bots in engagements.” They’re encouraging peers to learn the latest technologies by demonstrating bots can save time. “We take them through something that they traditionally do through our T&amp;E system and show how using a bot can improve the process,” said Tyler. “It’s all about demystifying the technology and helping others to see the possibilities.” Automating Workday reporting: Over her 18 years with the firm, Tracy Vinson has recognized &amp; helped teams improve countless processes. Our teams have always wanted to make things better -- they just didn't always have the skills to make it happen on their own. With Your Tomorrow and digital upskilling, that is changing”; “now everyone can do this and feel confident about it.” Just recently, when her Talent partner expressed a pain point for our Talent consultants -- who regularly had to pull four separate Workday reports and manually copy information from each -- Tracy took the time to interview the team about the issue, goal, best case solution and end goal, created the ‘Workday HC Reporting - Enhancing &amp; Managing Worker Detail’ solution and brought it back for testing and refinement and finally uploaded it to Digital Lab. “The solution is targeted to our 400+ Talent consultants, so it hasn’t been downloaded too much, but everybody has a different need. That is what is great about Digital Lab -- you can look at numerous solutions (even if outside your area), learn from them and customize them for your needs.” Tracy’s advice? “There is so much opportunity for everyone now to upskill. Outside of Digital Accelerators, you can access self-service options. Don't wait for someone to train you, empower yourself!” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/35636.html</url><pwc_title>7 tools to help you prepare for a more efficient busy season</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:41:45</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:Assurance|source:Assurance</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-12-06 10:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>Assurance</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>7 tools to help you prepare for a more efficient busy season 7 tools to help you prepare for a more efficient busy season Assurance Dec. 6, 2018 Year-end is almost here.

Good thing PwC’s EyeMed Vision Care Plan benefits help make it easy. See the signs Your eyes are always changing (more than you notice) and they might be under more strain now — especially during our busiest times. Plus, health problems like diabetes or high blood pressure can show signs through your eyes — signs an eye exam may help you spot.* Put your PwC benefits to work If you’re enrolled in PwC’s Vision Care Plan, consider scheduling an exam. You’re eligible for one each plan year (July 1-June 30). Pick an eye doctor with the location and hours that work for you. You’ll pay a $10 exam copay when you visit a network provider. If you use an out-of-network provider, you’ll pay 100% and EyeMed will reimburse you up to $35 toward the cost of care.** If you need glasses or contacts, your cost ranges based upon your needs and the options you choose. Remember, you’ll experience the greatest cost savings when you use in-network providers. If you’re not currently enrolled in the Vision Care Plan, you will have an opportunity to elect coverage during this year’s Annual Enrollment period, May 1-15, for coverage effective July 1. Earn Well-Being Rewards points The Well-Being Rewards Program provides an added incentive for having your routine eye exam.

Phoenix, our new One Firm, cloud-based, tech-enabled workflow platform will eventually connect you more seamlessly to our service delivery teams -- like our Service Delivery Centers and Centers of Excellence and even digital labor (e.g., robotics) in the future. That means you can spend less time managing the workflow and more time delivering enhanced quality and more value to our clients, from the office or on the go. In July, select US engagement teams began piloting the first version of Phoenix -- the basic version of the platform that will be enhanced and further developed throughout FY19. We’ll add more teams and features to further standardize and digitize the global delivery experience. Here are a few enhancements to look for: Making Phoenix mobile-ready Automating resource assignment (for delivery teams) Building in issue-escalation capabilities Making it easier to provide feedback Enhancing the dashboards and reporting capabilities to be more like a virtual PMO We will also further streamline the experience by integrating with LoS tools like Aura, Tax Engagement Center and DMS. These changes will also provide better transparency into the status of work. Finally, as part of our continuous improvement and simplification promises to you, we will sunset our legacy Envoy system next summer. If you’re part of the first Phoenix pilot, you already should have heard from us and received training. If you’re not part of the first wave, stay tuned for updates in PwC Inside.

While the Brokerage Simplification Program (BSP) can help you avoid exceptions to the five-day rule, it does not pre-clear and cannot prevent you from making an investment that is impermissible to you. It’s just that simple — before you purchase an investment, pre-clear it in Independence Checkpoint. BSP won’t do it for you.

In addition to the Leadership Development Experience/CRT reminders shared earlier this week, here are additional considerations for Tax to help you make the most of this time to review your progress and talk about your career goals: Preparing for your mid-year coaching conversation Mid-year coaching conversations are an opportunity to step back with your Development Team and reflect on your progress against the PwC Professional framework, development needs and impact so far this performance year. Capture your impact and cover 80% of your hours in Snapshots. Be thoughtful in the “Please describe your role in the work included in this Snapshot” field -- this is a great place to highlight your specific impact -- especially hours saved from your P5M contributions and other digitization efforts. (Here’s additional guidance and examples for this part of your Snapshots.) If this is a potential promotion year for you, discuss your progress toward and plan for completing the promotion requirements, including Blindspot training, Tax Foundation Milestones, credentialing and Quality &amp; Risk Management courses. Looking ahead to year-end Career Roundtable discussions, what factors into compensation, promotion and tier decisions? While mid-year coaching conversations are more informal, it’s not too soon to think about actions you can take to influence Career Roundtables. As our Tax strategy and expectations have evolved, what impact looks like has also evolved. With Your Tomorrow, Project 5 Million there are opportunities to show your impact beyond our traditional metrics, and it’s important to understand what your Relationship Leader will discuss in CRTs to assess your performance for the year: Progression: How you are progressing against the five dimensions of the PwC Professional Framework Annual Performance Tier: Performance Impact -- differentiated performance impact as described in Snapshot Performance Differentiators LOS Performance Metrics as outlined in our FY19 Expectations Placemats (goals are updated annually and vary by staff level -- digitization is a critical component this year) Commitment to P5M digitization strategy -- contributions to P5M as demonstrated through Snapshots; the Your Tomorrow, Project 5 Million Hour Tracker; Digital adoption with available metrics reflecting usage of tools (e.g., Alteryx, Tableau, bots, Digital Lab, etc.); and active incorporation of technology into engagement planning and execution Our firm and Tax strategies are designed to promote the development, career progression and success of our Tax professionals. Own your role in the process -- connect with your Development Team throughout the year.

Before you read about the what, I want to remind you of the why. Our clients are telling us they want more value, a digital experience and a lower cost. All of you want to be part of a firm with great opportunities to grow and make a difference -- and we're responding! Each of these changes has a digital element and moves us closer to being a truly tech-enabled firm. Because these changes reduce manual work, we’ll have more time to spend in ways that add value -- focusing on our clients, coaching each other, or caring for ourselves, families or friends. Plus, when we're more efficient, we can invest in our business and all of you through Your Tomorrow. So my ask for you is simple: Use these new platforms and tools. We’re not only creating a better experience for you, we’re also taking steps that add up to a firm that is relevant, ready for the future -- and a great place for you Risk-related issues? The One Firm Risk Organization is here to help What’s in it for you: An easier, faster, One Firm way to navigate risk-related decisions and move to market. The scoop: Need help with client acceptance, risk management, contracting or Independence issues? Our new One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) can help. OFRO specialists are organized by service offering (not LoS or business unit), which means your first point of contact will bring in the right subject matter specialists to address your issue. No more navigating multiple groups! Plus, the new OFRO portal offers a wealth of resources on risk-related matters, and new tools like Rapid Engage, Create and DocuSign (read on!) further simplify the client and engagement startup process. Easy as pie: Rapid Engage delivers engagement startup faster and easier What’s in it for you: Go from opportunity identification to WBS code release faster. The scoop: Do you spend a lot of time getting engagements set up and codes opened? Help is on the way! Rapid Engage is a desktop and mobile tool that provides a transparent, dashboard overview of the process and streamlines startup for US engagements. (Think of those “pizza trackers” that allow customers to watch their pizza status as it moves from order, to oven, and out for delivery.) The tool overlays our existing client and engagement acceptance systems (including A&amp;C, AFS, engagement contracts, myEngage and others), providing one interface that helps you complete required process steps and track your progress. Rapid Engage will roll out in a phased approach throughout August; look for more information from your line of service. Watch a preview video. Having two work phone numbers is so FY18. Welcome to Mobile Only What’s in it for you: Just one phone number, one voicemail to manage and one point of contact for your clients and colleagues. The scoop: We’re on our way to becoming a Mobile Only workplace -- that means retiring individual office “landline” phone numbers in favor of mobile phones, and significantly reducing phones in all offices. Whether you're in the office or on the move, you’ll simply use your mobile phone, Google Meet or WebEx to connect and collaborate. We’ll still have speakerphones in enclosed spaces like offices and conference rooms. Become an early adopter by voluntarily retiring your number now; the office-by-office rollout will start this November and conclude in March 2020. Here’s how. Phoenix takes flight: An easier way to work with our Service Delivery Centers What’s in it for you: An easier, more efficient way to work with our service delivery teams. And goodbye, Envoy! The scoop: In July the first teams began using the initial version of Phoenix, our new workflow platform to request, receive and manage services from service delivery teams (e.g., SDCs and CoEs, and in the future third parties and digital). Phoenix digitizes interactions with our delivery teams, standardizes processes, and eventually will streamline the experience by integrating with Google and existing LoS tools like Aura, Engagement Center and DMS.

If so, have you considered whet Do you work on multinational clients? If so, have you considered whether the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) 6 affects them? One Firm Risk Organization April 25, 2019 Working with multinational clients can present some unique risks, as there is a need to understand how non-US laws may influence projects you undertake with your client. Understanding the DAC6 reporting requirements, effectively communicating those requirements to your clients, and considering the costs associated with compliance when formulating engagement budgets, can avert engagement surprises and dissatisfied clients. What is DAC6? In brief, it's a new directive adopted by the European Union (EU) that requires reporting of certain cross-border arrangements if the arrangement affects at least one entity in an EU Member State and is determined to include one or more defined “hallmarks”, which are broadly defined characteristics identified as potentially indicating aggressive tax planning. (Hallmarks) Reporting of such cross-border arrangements will apply to arrangements after June 25, 2018. However, reporting is not expected until July of 2020. The goal of DAC6 is to provide tax authorities of Member States with more information on tax planning transactions so the tax authorities in the Member States can assess whether such transactions facilitate tax evasion or avoidance. In general, the mandatory reporting requirements apply to “Intermediaries,” which are defined broadly to include tax advisors, accountants, lawyers, banks, financial advisors, etc. who design or market reportable cross-border tax-planning arrangements with an EU cross-border element for their clients. Those who provide assistance and advice on the tax aspects of such arrangements may also be considered Intermediaries. Where no Intermediary exists or has a reporting obligation, the obligation to make the required disclosure falls to the taxpayer. While we generally do not believe the US firm will be an Intermediary under DAC6, if you work with a PwC network member firm located in the EU, the PwC network member may be an Intermediary for reporting purposes. This means they’ll look to you for information regarding the mandatory reporting. If there is no Intermediary, your client will look to you to provide insight and assistance in meeting its reporting obligation. Begin the DAC6 dialog Make sure you know the basics of DAC6 so you can effectively communicate them to your client and retain the appropriate documentation to support any reporting requirement. For more information on this emerging reporting requirement, see the DAC6 talking points (internal only). You can also watch this short video: DAC6 in 90 seconds- Key elements of the new EU cross-border tax directive and share it with your clients. Still have questions on DAC6?

Through their soup kitchen, food pantry and various programs catered for senior citizens, Food Bank NYC provides more than 100,000 free meals each month and over 1.2 billion to date. On the morning of November 6th, half of our PwC volunteers worked together to chop fresh salads, cook pasta and meatballs, bake an apple dessert, and serve the nutritious lunch to over 200 senior citizens. The other volunteers had the opportunity to assist local residents, some with families of up to 8 people, shop through the Food Bank’s pantry ranging from fresh produce to meats, grains and more. One of our volunteers, Carlos Fidalgo, using his fluency in Spanish, was able to speak to over 50 families over the phone and deliver the news that they would be receiving a turkey for Thanksgiving. Carlos, in reflecting on this experience, shared,“It was incredibly fulfilling to help these local families in need. When being notified that they were receiving a turkey for Thanksgiving, people began to cheer and you could hear the sheer joy in their voices. These experiences make you truly appreciate the things we sometimes take for granted.” In this humbling experience, the PwC team was able to get to know the senior citizens community better and create a positive impact on society by helping those less fortunate. Moreover, our group of 25 individuals, grew their personal and professional network, strengthening the PwC brand in sharing this experience with one another. Chris Scarpati, Capital Markets Practice Leader, who has now championed this initiative for the past 2 years commented, “These events are always a great chance to give back to the community, help those who are less fortunate and be reminded to be thankful for all that we have. It’s been wonderful to see how this program has grown. Last year we started out with one session, this year we expanded it to two in order to help out more families and our PwC community responded, filling all those spots. I’m sincerely appreciative of the team's time and willingness to volunteer and am hopeful that we can continue this promising trend in the coming years.” The Food Bank team shared their gratitude for the time and enthusiasm that our volunteers were able to give that day noting that efforts like PwC’s are truly the “life-line of the Food Bank and help make their organization possible”. Showing you care about others, making a difference through your actions, and working together with diverse peoples are core pillars of PwC values that came to life at the NYC Food Bank. The team looks forward to its next rewarding volunteer experience! Interested in getting your PwC Team involved at the NYC Food Bank? Please contact John Giannotto for more information.

Between PowerUp!, Tech While You Trek, Learning Bursts, Digital Quests and more, 36,000+ of us have accessed at least one Digital Upskilling learning channel! This impressive statistic says we’re excited about investing in ourselves and building our digital skills — and that we’re well on our way to meeting our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal: all partners and staff earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30, 2019. This is a credential that’s ours to keep and take with us, wherever our careers may lead. Digital Quests Everyone’s upskilling journey is personal and will proceed individually. There’s one requirement we all share, however: to complete the four Digital Quests. The first, the SquadFuel project, launched Nov. 6. Many of you have already completed it and have found it to be challenging, informative and rewarding. Haven’t gotten to the first Digital Quest yet? Here are three ways to prepare: Play PowerUp! Listen to Tech While You Trek in the Digital Hub Complete Learning Bursts Need inspiration? Meet these three learners who approach upskilling in different ways, and learn how they’re choosing their own digital adventures. You can also find learning resources on the “Digital Quest” page of the Digital Hub. What’s next? The second Digital Quest, The BankSure Project, will launch Dec. 20. There is no expectation that you complete the second Digital Quest during the firmwide shutdown. Please take that time to relax, unwind and recharge with friends and family so you can come back refreshed and ready to tackle the second Digital Quest in January. Look for the third and fourth Digital Quests by mid-March 2019. When you complete all four Digital Quests, you will earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. So, in the meantime, get in the game! Continue to build the critical digital skills that will help us work more efficiently and provide even better quality and value to our clients. The digital knowledge we’re all gaining will help us inside and outside of PwC, now and in the future.

Where does your clie Cyber trailblazers are outperforming their peers. Where does your client stand? Advisory - test May 31, 2019 “Digital trailblazers” -- or organizations that take a business-driven cybersecurity approach to their digital initiatives -- are achieving better outcomes than their peers in digital initiatives and security overall. How can your client become one of them? Introduce them to PwC’s second Digital Trust Insights survey: Cyber trailblazers reframe security, driving business growth. This global study of over 3000+ respondents uncovered that digital trailblazers -- the top 25% of respondent organizations -- are: More proactive, preemptive and responsive than their peers, minimizing the operational impacts of cyber threats More likely to be credited with adding significant value to their organizations More optimistic about the potential for growth in revenue and profit margin More likely to embed their cybersecurity teams within the business to support strategic goals Trailblazers stand out in how they connect with the business: On strategy -- 65% of trailblazers strongly agree their cybersecurity team is embedded in the business, conversant in the organization’s business strategy and has a cybersecurity strategy that supports business imperatives (vs. 15% of others). On a risk-based approach -- 89% of trailblazers say their cybersecurity teams are consistently involved in managing the risks inherent in the organization’s business transformation or digital initiatives (vs. 41% of others). In execution -- 77% of trailblazers strongly agree their cybersecurity team has sufficient interaction with senior leaders to develop an understanding of the company’s risk appetite around core business practices (vs. 22% of others). The findings also explore who the trailblazers are -- looking across industries and regions to identify those who excel in aligning their business and cybersecurity strategies, take a risk-based approach, and coordinate among teams that monitor and manage risks. What you can take to your clients Clients have the opportunity to discover what sets trailblazers apart from the rest of the pack, and how to follow their example. Clients can also engage with the data through a series of interactive charts, filtering by region, industry, or company size. The findings can support client conversations around digital business trust. In addition, PwC’s Digital Trust Insights has a roadmap of where companies can focus attention on closing cybersecurity gaps.

Get resources to use in One Firm conversations and preview the findings below. This year’s report, titled “The Anxious Optimist in the Corner Office,” finds CEO sentiment to be at a post-recession high. A majority of US CEOs (52%) are “very confident” in revenue growth in 2018. That upturn in sentiment was building even before the overhaul to the US corporate tax system became law. Our findings are based on the views of nearly 1,300 CEOs in 85 countries (including more than 100 US CEOs), interviewed from Oct. 3 – Nov. 20, 2017.

The full report is available at www.pwc.com/usceosurvey. Driving growth in 2018: CEOs tell us they’ll work on many fronts to drive revenue and profitability this year. Most plan to strengthen the top line (79% global CEOs, 95% US CEOs). Acquisitions are also part of the growth playbook for more US CEOs this year (69%), far more than for their global peers (42%) and a significant jump from the 55% of US CEOs who were planning on new M&amp;A this time last year. Upskilling the workforce: US CEOs are in expansion mode, with 63% expecting headcount in their organization to increase this year. They’re also saying it’s more difficult to find qualified workers. CEOs are investing in continuous learning initiatives (39% US CEOs) to reduce employee churn and provide development paths for employees to add skills. The findings show that companies using robots and artificial intelligence to improve customer experience are more likely to invest in digital reskilling and development programs. Threats that are not abating in a faster-growth world: More US CEOs report high-level concern over cyberthreats (63%) and geopolitical uncertainty (50%) than last year. More US CEOs also believe we’re headed for a new round of global tax competition compared to their peers in priority international markets.

How we can help each other unplug -- and win a little ca Summer plans? How we can help each other unplug -- and win a little cash, too! Tim Ryan May 20, 2019 Team, I’m asking you to do something for yourself this week -- and that's to plan for a break! If you already have time off on your calendar -- thank you! When we take care of ourselves we’re better at work and in everything we do. There's another piece to my ask -- and that's to sit down with your team or put your plans on the agenda for your next catch up. Talk with your team about how you can protect the time so you can disconnect and recharge and then help your teammates do the same. I'm often asked to share my advice. One thing I've learned over the course of my career is that it's important to be disciplined about planning for and taking the time away. This is something I wish I had done better earlier in my career but I've learned! I have my time off blocked on my calendar this summer and I'm looking forward to it. With Be well, work well, we are committed to creating the culture and environment where we can take care of ourselves and manage our energy. And booking your time off is a key way to do that. To add to the fun, we're going to have a contest. From now until Sept. 17, plan and take your break, snap a photo and share on social media using #pwctakesabreak (in keeping with the spirit of things, you should do this before or after your time off -- not during!). You’ll be included in a drawing for money you can use to make your next break even more fun. Read the details here. Team, our commitment to Be well, work well is essential to who we are as a firm -- and disconnecting from work is part of taking care of ourselves. Many of you have told me how excited you are for our upcoming July 4th break and the “guilt-free” time off -- I am too! I hope you'll take this gift of time and enjoy it -- and try to plan for some additional vacation too. Success is a team sport at PwC -- and that includes being successful at unplugging and getting away. What you do is up to you, but I hope you’ll book the time, plan for it and take it.

Take 5 with Beth Fish: A PwCer since high school! IFS June 6, 2018 Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. 1. Name, rank, serial number? Beth Fish, a director in National Office Services. I’m responsible for space management operations, including the team that provides the US offices with meeting and workspace support and all of the supporting technology. I'm based in Cincinnati and have been with the firm for 35 years. 2. What’s a typical day for you? I'm 100% virtual, so I spend a lot of time on conference calls! I collaborate closely with our Space Concierge team in Tampa, helping make sure they’re equipped to support our people across the US with their office and meeting space needs. Just last year they completed over 56,000 tickets! I’m also working on some exciting technology projects: we’re preparing to upgrade our meeting room and workstation booking platforms over the next year to make the user experience more flexible and responsive to people’s changing day-to-day needs. It’s really fun helping PwC’s staff be more mobile and digital. 3. How did your journey lead you to this role? I joined PwC in 1982 as a part-time word processor, participating in a "co-op" program in my senior year of high school. After high school graduation I was offered a full-time position in Office Services ordering office supplies, delivering mail and answering phones. My journey led me through various roles including receptionist, accounting and Human Resources, where I scheduled client engagement teams and supported local recruiting efforts. What followed was a combined Office Services and Human Resources role managing IFS staff in various offices, including operations. I had the pleasure of serving as director and Market Admin Leader for Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, and ultimately moved to my current position in National Office Services four years ago. I also studied at night along the way, receiving my B.S. in Accounting and my MBA -- while working full time. 4. How does your team bring value to PwC? We help make PwC a best-in-class, mobile, hoteling office environment. We work closely with National Real Estate and IT to optimize the way we use space and bring all our people a One Firm office experience. 5. What keeps you busy outside of work? I enjoy volunteering at my church. My family and I serve on many different volunteer committees. We really look forward to a yearly event where our church members help with hundreds of volunteer projects throughout the community -- from helping the elderly to assisting those with special needs to painting schools and even handling landscaping and other chores for those in need. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

It’s not the red carpet, but it’s still a big deal. For the past two years, manager Julie Womack and senior manager Edd Beese, both on the Creative Team, have served as judges for the Telly Awards, an organization that honors the best video work from advertising agencies, corporations, TV stations and production companies around the world. “I’m wowed by the talent out there,” says Julie. “Judging provides a good source of inspiration for what we do every day,” shares Edd. How did they get selected to be judges? “It’s a combination of PwC’s great relationship with the Telly Awards and that the Creative Team has consistently won many of these awards over the years,” says Julie. “They seek credentialed representatives from organizations with a solid reputation in the creative services field, and we’re honored to represent the firm,” adds Edd. Award entries typically include campaigns, commercials and product and service launches. “There are funny ones, too,” says Julie. “It’s less Hollywood and more corporate, but it’s just as thrilling for us,” says Edd. Both agree the thrill includes seeing their names on the official Tellys website. And, while all 200 judges are listed on that site, there’s no interaction between them. “We don’t know who judges what; it’s pretty hush-hush,” says Julie. “But I would love to see how my opinion matches up with theirs,” adds Edd. Julie describes the process: “Right after the entry deadline, we’re assigned submissions according to our specialty; I judge animations and Edd judges the video category. It takes two or three days to go through them all; we get about 60 each and watch them from start to finish.” Edd adds that “it’s all online so we can do it from the comfort of our own homes.” Each entry is judged against specific criteria, spanning over 100 categories, including a section for recommendations and feedback. There are also submissions from PwC’s Creative Team. “But we don’t see those, so there’s never a conflict of interest,” says Julie. Sometimes they spot a commercial on TV and notice it was one that they judged. “We love being part of the process,” gushes Julie. “The caliber of what we see is inspiring. I enjoy comparing what we do every day to our industry peers and being able to set the bar by having a voice in what’s considered the industry standard.” Edd agrees. “I like the fresh ideas and exposure to new trends. We’re always looking for new ways to deliver what we do. Judging provides a great benchmark for us.” They also share in the anticipation when the winners are announced each May. “It’s the highlight of my year,” says Julie. Edd emphasizes that it’s purely voluntary. “We don’t get paid; we do it for the glory! It’s such a privilege. When I view the material I often think to myself ‘the work we do at PwC is just as good!’” If your project requires creative video services, you can start a conversation with the Creative Team by filling out a request. The team provides a wide range of high quality, PwC branded services like studio and on-location filming, animation and video editing. Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

The OFRO Tax self-study series is required for Associates, Senior Associates and Managers and should be completed the earlier of 12 months of the courses being posted to your Vantage account or promotion to the next staff level. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the OFRO Tax expectation is for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility.

A data breach can expose personal data like payment information and passwords. Here are some actions to help you stay safe if your data has been compromised. Change your password -- By changing your password with the affected organization, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your data. You should also change the passwords on accounts that share login details. Check your financial statements and accounts -- If card or payment information has been part of the breach, review your statements to verify that no unauthorized payments have been made. If you notice unusual transactions or are otherwise concerned, contact your provider and follow their advice. You should also check your credit bureau reports annually to confirm accuracy. Watch out for unsolicited calls and messages -- If your contact information has been compromised, you may see an increase in unsolicited emails, calls or text messages. Stay vigilant, never provide personal information if you can’t verify the source, and report any suspicious emails — here's what to look for. Try the new “phish” button in your Google Mail side panel to report it. Be aware of what you say -- PwC serves many organizations. As a representative of our firm, you should be cautious about posting anything on social media or speaking publicly about specific breaches. This could damage relationships or otherwise reflect negatively on the firm. See the US Public Communications and Social Media Policy for more details. At PwC, we take the protection of information we hold extremely seriously. Advanced security measures and specialist security teams monitor our network and systems around the clock to safeguard data.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m My Tran, senior manager and learning architect in Learning &amp; Development. I’m based in San Francisco and have been with the firm for nine years. What’s a typical day like for you? I’m always designing or building something! As a learning architect, I create learning solutions for our people. I love how interactive my job is; lots of problem-solving keeps things interesting! From tactical design to technology solutions, finding ways to create programs that enhance the knowledge and development of our people is my passion. I’m like any other architect: I work closely with internal teams to build a “blueprint” of the program design, then confirm that the plans are structurally sound before building the final product. For the past year I’ve spent a lot of time with my team designing the PwC Digital Badge Program*, which is part of Digital Upskilling under Your Tomorrow. How did your journey lead you to this role? As a campus hire, I began as an auditor in Assurance. The firm’s commitment to flexibility and infinite learning was a real draw for me; I received my master’s degree in industrial organizational psychology while working full time. A constant desire to try new things led me to the Learning &amp; Development team. I was excited for a way to bring my master’s degree to life as a learning consultant to our people, which ultimately led to designing and delivering learning solutions around the country. In my current role, I focus on solving complex business problems, including helping to create our first PwC Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Coursera, an online library of courses that are globally available to our people, for free. It’s been a natural progression; each role has led to the next one. Working with my team to help others has always been the best part of my career journey! How does your team bring value to PwC? We love finding ways to transform a creative vision into a reality to solve important problems. Imagine creating a wish list and finding ways to achieve everything on the list. Digital badges are a great example: They tell the digital story of our people, allowing us to be recognized as infinite learners both inside and outside the firm. The beauty of digital badges is they are yours; you can take them with you even if you leave the firm. They show your commitment to your development journey in today’s data-driven culture. We’re so excited to provide a way to tell our digital stories and highlight the skills we acquire throughout our careers. We’re pretty proud of that! What would people be surprised to know about you? I end each week with yoga. Whether indoors or out, yoga is my go-to for relaxing, recharging and reflecting on the day. Another way I recharge is by doing home renovations with my husband. We just completed a two-year overhaul of our house; we gutted everything and rebuilt it from the frame up. So I guess building and design really is in my blood! * Currently the Digital Acumen knowledge badge is available firmwide to partners and staff who complete all four Digital Quests by June 30, 2019. While the full digital badge program is currently only available to Digital Accelerators, it will be rolled out firmwide in FY20. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

I want others to know about the important work we do, and I also want talented people who share our values and sense of purpose to learn more about our profession, so I wrote about this on LinkedIn this week. I understand that there’s always room for continued improvement and vigilance in carrying out our role in financial reporting. And it’s human nature to focus on the times when things don’t go as they should. But -- as an optimist -- I think we should spend time looking at everything that goes right because of the hard work, courage and discipline of people in our profession. Quality financial reporting provides a foundation for millions of people who invest their money to consider as they save for a home, for their kids’ education, and for retirement. Our role in the financial reporting profession is a noble and important one. Next week, on Sept. 27, we’re once again joining with others in our profession to let people know we’re #auditorproud. See PwC Inside for resources and details on how to participate if you want to be part of this special day to celebrate the audit profession -- and all of us are invited to share our pride. Even though our work is quiet and behind the scenes -- our impact is big. If you’ve got anyone in your life who wonders just what it is that auditors do, I hope you’ll share this with them and do it with pride!

For some, it’s about hitting the gym to take a yoga class or leaving early to see a child’s soccer game. But for Simona Codreaunu and Armando Moss it’s an opportunity to reunite with loved ones in their hometowns: Simona Codreaunu: With tears in her eyes and a heart full of hope, Simona said goodbye to family and friends in 2005. She left Romania, her native country, to launch a career with PwC in Boston. “It was difficult to leave my home and travel halfway across the globe,” Simona said. “But I was excited to start a new chapter in my life. The opportunity to join PwC right out of college was too good to pass up and made the move worth it.” Simona regularly used her vacation time to visit her family in Romania. When the firm began its journey to a more flexible culture in 2011, she had an idea. “I would typically take a two-week vacation every year for my trips back home. With flexibility, I proposed to extend the trip to four weeks by working for two and vacationing the other two,” she said. Simona’s team and clients supported the plan, and soon her July trip to Romania became an annual tradition. Thanks to our tech-enabled firm and culture of flexibility, Simona is able to deliver quality service from halfway across the globe. And every year, she returns to Boston rejuvenated and happy. “The key is communicating with your team,” she said. “Some people are reluctant or scared to ask for flexibility. But there’s no need to feel that way. Speak up if that’s what you want, and your team will support you.” Simona hopes her flexibility story will inspire others to seek the right work/life balance that fulfils them and allows them to be their best self at work. Armando Moss: A member of the Bahamas National Swim Team, Armando travels from Cincinnati to his native island twice a year for competitions and to reconnect with family. Recently, an urgent personal matter came up that required him to remain there for an extended period of time. “I had an up-front and honest conversation with my manager,” Armando recalled. “I proposed a solution that combined vacation with flexibility. I assured my team that the flexibility would be used to get my work done and not to relax on a beach or hang out with family. The team trusted me and fully supported my proposal.” Armando connected with a Talent Consultant at PwC’s Bahamas office to see if he could work out of the local office. “They welcomed me with open arms,” he said. “I remember walking in on the first day. My laptop immediately connected to the network and I thought, ‘Wow, PwC is truly embracing a One Firm approach and global mindset.’” Armando was greeted by another pleasant surprise on his first day: “A Human Capital manager sent an email to the entire office introducing me and encouraging people to make me feel at home. It was an incredible feeling,” he said. Armando returned to his Cincinnati office feeling empowered to ask for flexibility, grateful for it and happy to know that he can continue to carry the Team Bahamas’ flag from country to country while pursuing a career at PwC. Clearly, flexibility is not a “one size fits all” concept, and it’s up to teams and individuals working together to define it for themselves. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: The firm must manage a variety of risks when a flexibility arrangement involves cross-border travel. For example, your travel must comply with immigration laws and you will be personally responsible for personal tax implications that may arise.

When new hires join PwC, a lot is riding on one component: the ambassador. These are people who self-nominate as the go-to person to help new joiners get acclimated. They’re ready to answer questions about all aspects of the firm, such as: “What should I wear on my first day?” “How is the firm organized?” “How do I track my time?” “What’s a Snapshot?” Navigating PwC is not always easy. Having an ambassador helps new joiners learn the firm and feel confident in their new roles -- and help them know where to go for help if they need it. Our onboarding program is market-based, which helps new joiners connect with their teams and their offices right away. Following this design, ambassadors are matched whenever possible with new joiners who are in their line of service, city and same staff level. This matching rubric helps ensure maximum connectivity between the ambassador and the new joiner. Want to help new joiners acclimate to the firm? Self-nominate today! “My ambassador was invaluable to me as I started with PwC,” said Nancy Geery, a senior associate on the Talent ID team. “She helped me assimilate and understand our culture. I felt comfortable to ask her anything and knew she would get right back to me.” Nancy’s ambassador, Manager Sheila Robinson agrees. “The way we onboard new joiners now by connecting people to their home offices is really smart,” she said. “Giving each new joiner an ambassador is a great way to help them get to the stage where they can take the training wheels off.” Putting herself in her new joiner’s shoes helped Barbora Silovska, an experienced associate. “I wanted to help her ease into her first week and make sure she knew there was someone there to answer questions.” The time commitment expected of ambassadors is manageable. In general, it’s a total of three to five hours over the new joiner’s first six months. During the new joiner’s first week, ambassadors take their new joiners out to lunch so they can get to know each other. After that, new joiners will reach out when they need help, and ambassadors will check in periodically to see how things are going. Experienced associate Ayodele Adefila summed it up well: “The ambassador program is a differentiator for PwC to help people feel on solid ground from the beginning. I saw first hand how important it is.” Associate ambassadors needed soon! Starting in January 2019, the ambassador program will expand to new campus and entry level hires, so we’ll be calling on hundreds of associates throughout the firm to self-nominate and serve as ambassadors at that time.

Partners and staff connected, collaborated and enriched each other’s Agile &amp; DevOps practices at this two-day, One Firm summit Agile &amp; DevOps methodologies have revolutionized the software development process and allowed organizations to provide their customers with digital products and services in less time. Our people are using Agile &amp; DevOps to transform organizational culture, practices and processes by leveraging lean thinking and automation. At the recent summit, participants from 13 countries engaged in group discussions about what our clients are looking for in this space and shared their experiences and capabilities. One of the participants, Advisory Senior Manager Linda Visser, reflects, “What I loved most was the chance to connect with colleagues from different countries and lines of service, who all brought different perspectives. It was helpful to hear about and learn from their experiences.” The summit culminated with a Shark Tank-style session where participants identified six strategic initiatives that will make a difference for our firm and clients. Participants plan to build on their momentum and reconvene next year in Europe. The Agile &amp; DevOps Global Leadership Summit is just one way our firm is working to continuously improve and how our people are coming together as One Firm to better serve our clients and grow our careers. Check out this short video to view highlights from this year’s summit. Notes: Visit Vantage to learn more about Agile &amp; DevOps methodologies.

With the help of our Well-Being Rewards program through Virgin Pulse, you can eat, drink, be merry and take care of yourself this season. One Dallas cybersecurity team is already getting a head start. “We’re a competitive 10-person group,” said team member Steven Son. “Since the app’s launch, we’ve created a bunch of five-day step challenges. It’s fun to see everyone vying for first place with nothing but pride on the line. It definitely increased the amount we move each day. I’ve even seen people walk in place or take the long route to meetings just to increase their steps.” To give themselves a competitive advantage, some members wait until the end of the day to sync their steps, leaving others to guess the amount they need to beat. One member went out for a late run on the final day of the challenge, to beat the top scorer. And a few people have happily reported achieving their weight loss goals as a result of their step challenges. To keep things interesting, the team changes up the challenges. “We’ve used the traditional step challenge -- who has the most steps in five days -- and we’ve also developed creative challenges,” said Steven. Among the competitions: be the first person to hit 50,000 steps, and beat the previous week’s top scorer. Taking thousands of steps each week has not only helped members rack up reward points, but it’s also led them to become more health conscious and encourage other healthy habits. Steven said the experience has brought the team closer together and improved morale at the office. “I encourage other teams to take advantage of the app, especially during busy season or the holidays when it’s easy to get distracted from things like exercise.” Haven’t joined the new Well-Being Rewards Program yet?

Protection of confidential data is part of our One Firm disciplined approach to how we provision, store, secure, use, expose and access data. This is an increasingly sensitive area for our clients, and this change is being made to enhance our data-protection controls. Data governance is at the heart of the firm’s strategy and is an underpinning of digital enablement. What’s changing? Saving files to any sort of removable media device, including firm-issued encrypted USB drives, will no longer be permitted. You will be able to transfer files from an encrypted device to your PC; however, changes cannot be saved back to the device from your PC. Note that you cannot edit a file on the removable media and then save it to your laptop. You will have to copy or move a file to your laptop first, then you may edit. How will this impact my work? We anticipate minimal impact to partners, staff and contractors. Several engagement teams are already using secure sites within their line of service or client-specific web applications to share data. Here is a list in Spark of preferred methods of data transmittal and collaboration tools. What if a client gives me a USB flash drive? Many clients are also moving away from the use of removable media devices. However, if you do need to access data from a client-issued USB, you will be able to save files from the encrypted device to your PC. What if my PC is not big enough to hold all of my files? Our new Windows 10 PCs have far more storage space than our previous PCs. You should review your files at the end of each engagement or project, save all documentation to the appropriate system of record and dispose of any files that are not subject to retention. What if there is an urgent situation, and I absolutely need to use removable media? While we expect that these instances will be rare, there may be situations in which a removable media device is the only solution. To request temporary permission, review policy guidance and submit a security exception request with appropriate approval. How do I submit a security exception request? Details about the Exception Request Process are available on Spark. What if my team already had an exception? You will not be impacted. Partners, staff and contractors that currently have exceptions will be granted exceptions on day one. What other information protection changes are taking place? The Information Protection Principles (IPP) have been updated to reflect the security measures around removable media devices. We’ve also added information to help you understand highly confidential information and the steps you need to take to help protect it. You can review the IPPs and a summary of recent updates here.
