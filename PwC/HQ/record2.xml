through the low clouds, the scenery reveals its vibrancy, as the waves reflect a translucent cyan blue before crashing loudly onto white sand. Wetsuits dried and ready, fresh wax coat on the surfboards. Tents are inspected, every seam scrutinized.

How do you get started with artificial intelligence? Do you have the right AI talent? How will tax reform affect investment in AI development? From the boardroom to the breakroom, AI is becoming part of every business conversation. We know it’s on our clients’ minds — and our new report, “AI Predictions in 2018,” takes a look at the big picture, putting a stake in the ground on the most important AI issues businesses will face in 2018. More than two dozen PwC leaders from across the US and UK firms weighed in on what AI means, and the results are relevant regardless of your line, sector or market. Here’s what those leaders see collectively in the crystal ball — and what businesses need to know in the coming months: Are the robots really coming for jobs? How do you get started with artificial intelligence? Do you have the right AI talent? How will tax reform affect investment in AI development? From the boardroom to the breakroom, AI is becoming part of every business conversation. We know it’s on our clients’ minds — and our new report, “AI Predictions in 2018,” takes a look at the big picture, putting a stake in the ground on the most important AI issues businesses will face in 2018. More than two dozen PwC leaders from across the US and UK firms weighed in on what AI means, and the results are relevant regardless of your line, sector or market. Here’s what those leaders see collectively in the crystal ball — and what businesses need to know in the coming months: AI will impact employers before it impacts employment. AI will hardly ruffle the job market in 2018. But since it demands new structures, enterprises will feel pressure to retool. AI will come down to earth — and get to work. It may not make a good science fiction film, but AI is ready to automate complex processes, identify trends to create business value, and provide forward-looking intelligence. AI will help answer the big question about data. AI isn’t the only answer to the ROI question about data integration and technology initiatives, but it’s an answer that comes with business cases. Functional specialists, not techies, will decide the AI talent race. Computer scientists are important, but domain experts with the skills to work with AI — and AI experts — are crucial for enterprise success. Cyberattacks will be more powerful because of AI — but so will cyberdefense. One job where AI has already shown clear superiority over human beings? Hacking. And now it will be crucial to your cybersecurity strategy. Opening AI’s black box will become a priority. A risk of AI: We won’t understand why it does what it does. The lack of trust will hurt adoption — but solutions are coming. Nations will spar over AI. It’s not a trade war but a research, investment and talent war, and China is moving fast. Pressure for responsible AI won’t just be on tech companies. A global consensus is emerging around principles for responsible AI to safeguard organizations and drive business value.

You may need to update your BSP account Changes in your personal life? You may need to update your BSP account Ethics &amp; Compliance June 12, 2019 Tagged News Maintaining your securities in the firm’s Brokerage Simplification Program (BSP) is an ongoing responsibility for anyone required to maintain an Independence Checkpoint portfolio -- for you and your family. If you don’t use Independence Checkpoint, this doesn’t apply to you. Stay mindful of events that can affect your independence and require you to manually update BSP account information, including: Changes to your brokerage account, or if you or someone in your immediate family opens a new brokerage account. If your spouse changes jobs, they’ll need to roll over their 401(k) or other employee benefit plan into an IRA or to their new employer’s plan. Getting married or moving in with a significant other (“spouse equivalent”), meaning their brokerage accounts also need to be recorded in Independence Checkpoint. BSP will not automatically account for these types of changes, so you’ll need to record any new accounts and update revised account numbers to maintain your personal independence. Rollovers must be completed within 90 days, and any new accounts or account number changes must be registered in Independence Checkpoint as soon as possible. Our Ethics &amp; Compliance BSP team is here to help. If you have questions visit BSP on Spark or reach out to the Compliance Resource Center (CRC) -- click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option 5.

Investing in developing our teams and ourselves is one way we can make a difference. Ask yourself: Am I supporting an environment of Real-time development (RTD) within my team? Model the behavior of giving and receiving feedback with your teams and make it a daily habit. Not only will you feel good, but it fuels our emotional well-being, which positively impacts our performance. And be sure to celebrate successes and show appreciation along the way. Download the new RTD Engagement Team Toolkit from PwC’s App Store. The toolkit includes in-the-moment actions you can take at the start, middle and end of an engagement/project. Take this quiz to get a real-time reality check. Am I regularly initiating and acknowledging Snapshots? The mobile Snapshot app is designed to be initiated easily and quickly for on-the-go professionals. Your Snapshots should cover work done to-date and 80% of your hours at any point during the year. Keep your TalentLink profile up to date. As a reviewer, have I completed the Snapshots I’ve received? Open the menu (upper-left corner in the Snapshot app) where the "Snapshots to Complete" item will indicate how many Snapshots need to be completed. Consider setting up time with your reviewer or reviewee to complete a Snapshot together.

2 Firm strategy homepage | Your Tomorrow Your Tomorrow is how we’re energizing and digitizing our business. We’re not academic about disruption. We’re embracing it and evolving rapidly so we stay in control of our destiny and secure the firm for today and for many years into the future. Where we are going We want to be the first to bring together -- at scale -- the energy and talent in Assurance, Advisory, Tax and Internal Firm Services with technologies to drive even more quality, greater efficiencies, and deeper insights -- as well as imagine new services -- with four components: Standardize: Before we can get the full benefit of the technology we’re introducing into the firm and our engagements, we need to have a common way of doing things Automate: After we standardize our processes, we’ll automate them. That helps us continue to drive up quality, operate more efficiently and reduce manual work -- a better experience for us and for our clients. Harness data: We want to be known as a firm that's world-class at putting data to work for the benefit of both our clients and the firm. We are building a world-class data platform so it will be faster and easier for us to harness the power of data -- to acquire and work with data more securely and efficiently to drive quality and uncover insights that add value for our clients. Upskill: We can’t digitize the firm without the best technology. And we can’t put technology to work without people who know how to use the tools. We’re not aware of any other organization that is upskilling its people at this scale and speed. This is a two-way commitment: Citizen-led innovation is all of us reimagining the possible and innovating how we deliver quality work each and every day. This starts with Digital Upskilling so we can put technology to work to add quality and value for our clients. Business-led meets citizen-led in the Digital Lab, an online community that will be introduced to the entire firm in November. With Digital Lab, the output of our citizen-led innovation is democratized, with solutions shared between PwCers. It will also be the place where business-led innovations reside so that we can access them in one place.

VN-812_Margin_AP it intentionally shared no code with NCSA Mosaic. The internal codename for the company's browser was Mozilla, a portmanteau of "Mosaic and Godzilla".[15] The first version of the Web browser, Mosaic Netscape 0.9, was released in late 1994. Within four months it had already taken three-quarters of the browser market and became the main web browser for the 1990s. To avoid trademark ownership problems with the NCSA, the browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator in the same year, and the company took the name Netscape Communications. Netscape Communications realized that the Web needed to become more dynamic. Marc Andreessen, the founder of the company, believed that HTML needed a "glue language" that was easy to use by Web designers and part-time programmers to assemble components such as images and plugins, where the code could be written directly in the Web page markup Related topic areas: We are adding new attribute market to personalize field and it is mentioned it will map to level 2 in market tag structure so does office attribute(it has base path same as market). Is there any difference between these two attributes other than the corresponding value to be picked from user profile?For example : currently office is mapped to workLocation.workLocationCd property of user profile where market is to be mapped with marketcode property.

We’re introducing four new compost bins on the 3rd and 4th floors for a 12-week pilot program this summer. Collection will happen on a daily basis with the food waste recycled off-site and turned into nutrient-rich compost for local farms and schools across Massachusetts. To make this program successful, we need you.

We recently connected with 4 Digital Accelerators to get a better sense of their digital journey - reimagining the possible, client impact, and DA advice. Reimagining the possible... Ethan Aronson is a Tax Digital Accelerator from the International Tax practice, who started with the firm in July 2018. After only 7 months with the firm, Ethan picked up a project from the Exempt Organizations Tax Services practice here in Boston (part of WNTS - National practice for PwC). At a high level, the practice manually prepares a high volume of state returns via SuperForms that took up to 40 hours per entity to complete. After an interview and walk through of the current process with the engagement team, Ethan was able to build a bot via UiPath that completes all of these forms in about 30 minutes per entity -- 98% reduction in hours. Due to its impact in the NE, the practice rolled out Ethan’s Bot nationally via Digital Lab and expects to save over 10,000 hours annually. Words of wisdom from Ethan - “Take advantage of the DA community. There is such a broad base of knowledge amongst the DAs and utilizing this group, the internal UiPath and Alteryx forums, and networking at DA events can really help you realize what is possible”. Client Impact… What are clients saying about our Digital focus? Emily Nolte, Advisory Senior Manager, shared that she has been able to have conversations with her clients about how PwC is leveraging automation and how we can help them do the same. Emily added that “It's been really neat to share our journey with clients I have known for years. We are helping them rethink how they can do 'business as usual' through digital solutions”. Insights &amp; DA Advice… Jenn Healey-Anderson, IFS Director in Partner Affairs, offered insight into how the transformation has not only changed how she works but how she feels about the firm. She shared the following - “Make the time for yourself to learn. What you will learn will make your job easier and more efficient. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, but break your task list into smaller tasks and just focus on one at a time. I look at what I have learned this year (Alteryx, Tableau, UiPath, Google App Scripts, SQL) and am simply humbled I have had this amazing year. I cannot thank the firm enough for investing in me the way they have”. Madeline Denoncourt, Assurance Director, added “What surprised me the most is how much the DA program is central to the Firm's Your Tomorrow Strategy and the Firm has gone all in on the investment in its people to digitally upskill in order to transform what we and our clients do." Also...in the spirit of re-imagining the possible we are always open to hearing your feedback and ideas on ways to bring our Your Tomorrow Strategy to life in the Northeast market.

The Pittsburgh office is going Mobile Only! Midwest Market Aug. 12, 2019 As of September 23, 2019, the Pittsburgh office will be a Mobile Only workplace! But that doesn’t mean we won’t have phones anymore. Here’s what you need to know -- and what we all need to do to get ready. What to expect when we go Mobile Only ● As of September 23, 2019 your office landline number will be retired. Callers will reach a general PwC greeting, which states the number is not accepting calls, plus an option to reach the receptionist. ● You’ll use your mobile phone, Google Meet or WebEx. We’ll no longer use Jabber Softphone. ● Phones will be removed from open workstations. However, there will still be plenty of landline phones in the office should you need one. ● Enclosed offices will continue to have landline speaker phones; they will have local generic extensions (similar to a conference room) and can be used for incoming, outgoing and international calls. ● Conference rooms will have speakerphones and our Workplace Collaboration Suite. What do you need to do? ● Spread the word starting now: Update your outgoing office voicemail to inform callers. Start notifying contacts; update external listings. Update your email signature and Spark profile. ● Make sure your mobile device is ready: Record a professional outgoing message for your mobile phone. If you don’t have a PwC mobile phone, order one— nearly all staff are now eligible for our eMobility program. (Be on the lookout for a special code so you can purchase a discounted headset.) ● Connect your mobile phone to PwC’s network via MobileIron. Enable WiFi calling so you can talk and text over PwC WiFi. Our WiFi and cell coverage will be able to meet our needs. ● If you use business cards, plan to update your contact info when you order new cards. If you have any questions, please visit Mobile Only on Spark or contact John Duchnowski. Note: If you have a special circumstance that requires you to retain your office phone number, please complete this exception request form prior to August 16, 2019 to submit your business case. While all requests will be considered by senior leadership, exceptions will be rare.

Each year, the tournament is hosted by a different IBT participant country. This year’s tournament was held in Ljubljana, Slovenia - or as it is referred to by the locals, ‘the jewel of Slovenia’. Arriving in Ljubljana and meeting the team was a strangely familiar moment. Although we talked as a team over the phone every week for the previous 3 months leading up to the tournament, we had never all met in person due to our differing geographical locations. However, due to our comfort with one another, we immediately bonded. The tournament began with an opening ceremony hosted by the Slovenian firm where all of the participating countries gathered for a night of networking and reacquainting. At the ceremony, 3, five team pools were established by random drawing for the following day. Team USA landed in Pool ‘C’ along with Lithuania, Cypress, Poland and Slovenia. The following day on Friday, pool play began. After 4 hard fought games, team USA emerged from pool ‘C’ undefeated and earned the number 1 seed going into the tournament. As any former IBT participant will tell you, team USA is always the antagonist of this tournament. Due to our record of winning in tournament history, we are always the team to beat and as such, everyone roots against us. As we advanced through the tournament beating Poland in round 1, Lithuania in round 2 and Serbia in round 3, we found ourselves in the championship against Italy. After rallying from an 11-point deficit in the first half, team USA emerged victorious, bringing home the gold as the winners of the IBT. Winning the IBT was truly an accomplishment, however the most rewarding experience of the entire trip was the networking and relationships I was able to build in such a short period of time. Not only did the team and coaches from the US firm build lasting connections, but we all established relationships with members of the international firms as well. I have already been able to chat with some of my international colleagues since returning home about everything from potential vacation destinations to international assignments. PwC and the IBT gave me a unique opportunity to expand my global acumen, cultivate meaningful relationships, and shoot a few jumpshots to tie it all together.

The Rochester office is going Mobile Only! Midwest Market June 10, 2019 As of August 19, 2019, the Rochester office will be a Mobile Only workplace! But that doesn’t mean we won’t have phones anymore. Here’s what you need to know -- and what we all need to do to get ready. What to expect when we go Mobile Only As of August 19, 2019, your office landline number will be retired. Callers will reach a general PwC greeting, which states the number is not accepting calls, plus an option to reach the receptionist. You’ll use your mobile phone, Google Meet or WebEx. We’ll no longer use Jabber Softphone. Phones will be removed from open workstations. However, there will still be plenty of landline phones in the office should you need one. Enclosed offices will continue to have landline speaker phones; they will have local generic extensions (similar to a conference room) and can be used for incoming, outgoing and international calls. Conference rooms will have speakerphones and our Workplace Collaboration Suite. What do you need to do? Spread the word starting now: Update your outgoing office voicemail to inform callers. Start notifying contacts; update external listings. Update your email signature and Spark profile. Make sure your mobile device is ready: Record a professional outgoing message for your mobile phone. If you don’t have a PwC mobile phone, order one— nearly all staff are now eligible for our eMobility program. (Be on the lookout for a special gift card code so you can purchase a discounted headset.) Connect your mobile phone to PwC’s network via MobileIron. Enable WiFi calling so you can talk and text over PwC WiFi. Our WiFi and cell coverage will be able to meet our needs. If you use business cards, plan to update your contact info when you order new cards. If you have any questions, please visit Mobile Only on Spark or contact John Duchnowski. Note: If you have a special circumstance that requires you to retain your office phone number, Please complete this exception request form prior to June 28, 2019 to submit your business case. While all requests will be considered by senior leadership, exceptions will be rare.

The Building Cafe will open on Monday, August 5th, with breakfast being served from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and lunch from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Grab-and-go and coffee services will also be provided from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. During the transition on Thursday, August 1st and Friday, August 2nd, there will be pop-ups in the 2nd floor Conference Center Michigan Ballroom from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. for breakfast and 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. for lunch. The building would like us to fill out the following survey. This gives us the opportunity to have an impact on what type of food, caterers, vendors etc in the Cafe. If you have preferences for certain restaurants, different foods, coffee, etc., please let them know by taking this survey. They would find it very helpful and of course being a large tenant in the building probably would bring some "weight" to some of the decisions. The more feedback the better. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/OneNorthWacker If there are any questions, please reach out to Jan Williams, OSM Contact: jan.m.williams@pwc.com Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/markets/central/Gympass_is_coming_onsite_save_the_date.html</url><pwc_title>Gympass is coming onsite!

But are you aware of the impact your efforts are already having on our business? Hard work is paying off. In our most recent FeeTV podcast, Tax Pricing Leader Ethan Williams interviews US Tax CFO Michelle Spratt to discuss the financial impact of Smart Pricing: what we’re seeing now, what we hope to see in the future, and what it means to you. In addition to providing valuable tips about how we can maximize the impact of Smart Pricing, Michelle also reflects on the role of the client CFO -- and how we can best address the needs of this type of a stakeholder while framing the value we deliver. Listen to the podcast now to hear Michelle’s perspective on good engagement economics, how Smart Pricing contributes to our growth goals, the exciting functionality in the works for the Smart Pricing Tool... and much more. Want to take the next step? Lead with value: it’s easy to get hung up on talking about our business -- how we’re staffing a project, the solutions we’re using, how the sausage gets made -- but we should be talking to the client about their business -- what’s the value they’re looking for and how we can we articulate our impact. Clearly define the scope: When we articulate the value we’ll deliver and the outcomes we’ll drive for the client, we’re in the best position to tightly define the scope. With a clearly defined scope, it will be easier later on to draw the line, and show the client how additional work should be subject to a change order / additional fee / new scope of work. Use the Smart Pricing Tool: this valuable resources can help us get to an answer on pricing -- in minutes! -- so we can be confident we’re pricing in line with our strategy. Change up how you present MSAs and rate cards: classify staff according to role on the project, not their staff level. For additional guidance, check out this video. Managers and up can learn more about these elements of our Smart Pricing strategy -- and much more -- on our Tax Smart Pricing microsite.

Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” As a Relationship Leader, San-Juan based Director Johnny Garcia always tells his assignees, “Help me help you.” And he means it. “At PwC, our assets are our people. As RLs, our responsibility is to make sure we are developing the best professionals...the more we get it right, the better we are able to represent our brand in the market. If RLs don’t have the right connection points with our people, we are simply not taking care of our assets.” Johnny has been with the firm for 12 years, with the last 9 years in SALT AWM -- and his dedication to the RL role is one of his most powerful contributions to PwC. One of his assignees shares, “Having Johnny as my RL has been a great journey. He is committed to helping me reach my personal and professional goals, and I can always count on him to have a candid conversation about whatever topic I have in mind”. Johnny’s Top 5 Best Practices for Relationship Leaders: Honor your mentors. Think about what your partners and mentors did for you when you were coming up in the firm. Your goal should be to turn around and do the exact same for those that you are leading and developing. Quick sprints. Rather than scheduling large blocks of time only a few times a year, focus on connecting for a few minutes more frequently. Those frequent conversations lead to more real-time coaching and help you feel connected to your assignee(s). Communicate, communicate, communicate. Whether or not you work with your assignees on an account, communication is important. Share information often and openly. It’s a two-way street. Lay out expectations about how you will work with assignees up front, and make sure your assignee feels empowered to tell you what they need from you to be successful. A mile in your own shoes. Don’t forget that you are in the shoes of your assignees when you sit at the table with your RL. You should put the same energy and excitement into your relationships with your own assignees. And what about advice for staff? Johnny says, “Be in the driver's seat of your career and advocate for yourself. Your Relationship Leader is there to help position you for success, identify the opportunity and help you execute the plan - but you are the owner of your career.” Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

She’s lived in three countries (China, New Zealand and the United States), and from an early age her life has been shaped by learning about different cultures and developing relationships with people from a variety of backgrounds. When she started school in New Zealand, she was still learning English. It was a challenging experience, but made easier due to the support she received by others within her community. “To this day, I remember a girl in my class who offered to read story books during lunch time to help me improve my English,” said Cecilia. The process of adapting to new environments, coupled with a sense of belonging and being embraced by the people around her, helped Cecilia develop an appreciation for the impact D&amp;I efforts can have in the lives of others. It’s a thread she’s woven into her life at PwC. Supporting diversity and inclusion within PwC Cecilia is a D&amp;I champion for the Value D&amp;I Initiative, hosting lunch and learns and participating in discussions on topics like gender perceptions and unconscious bias -- and in the process, bringing her passion to her peers within the firm. Cecilia was inspired to get involved in driving Inclusion at the firm last year after attending PwC’s Accelerate program, a three-day leadership development experience for Pan-Asian experienced associates where participants explore how to build strong relationships, communicate effectively and bridge cultural differences. Through the Accelerate program she met and connected with Tax Partner Margie Dhunjishah. They had the opportunity to get to know each other, share their views and practice building cultural dexterity within the firm. Margie continues to serve as a mentor to Cecilia and they have developed their friendship since they met at the conference. “It’s wonderful to see Cecilia’s growth and commitment to supporting D&amp;I efforts,” said Margie, “She’s purposeful in her intent and actions to create awareness with others. She’s living our values.” Check out Tax in 10 and explore diversity and inclusion with Margie Dhunjishah and Cecilia Chen Get more.

Here's how Want to find your edit history in Mapper? Here's how Tax June 11, 2019 Mapper allows users to see the Edit History for an Account Map, including what changed, who made the change, and when the change was made. How can I tell if a team member edited the Account Map? Towards the top of the Account Maps page, from the “Actions” drop down menu, when you select “Account map history,” a modal (similar to a pop up window) will appear. (Refer to the screenshot below). This modal, known as the History for Account Maps, will detail the history of all changes to your account map including the mapping change (what the item was before and after the update), the user that made the change, and the date when the change was made. This listing can also be exported to Excel for your use. See below to gain a quick understanding of what else you should know and can do with your Account Maps: What is an Account Map? The Account Map shows the taxonomies to which each of your client’s accounts are assigned. Mapper uses machine learning to map your client’s Chart of Accounts to PwC standard taxonomies to create your Account Map. Can I edit my Account Map? Yes, you can edit the taxonomy that an account is mapped to by double clicking on the taxonomy. A drop down menu will appear for you to select the taxonomy you need. You can also use type-ahead search by typing all or part of the taxonomy code or any part of the description to narrow the list or find the exact one you want even faster. Can I edit multiple times at once? Yes, the “Bulk Edit” feature, allows you to make edits to multiple items. Upon selecting the “Bulk Edit” button towards the top right of the Account Maps screen, your screen will change to look similar to Excel. Within the “Taxonomy” column, you can double click a cell to select a different taxonomy and use copy/paste shortcuts (ctrl + c and ctrl + v) or drag a cell up or down sequential cells to quickly update multiple items. Within the Preparer &amp; Reviewer Sign Off columns, you can also copy/paste and drag to sign off on multiple items. When you’re done making updates, select the “Exit Bulk Edit” button on the top right of the page. Did you know there are 1,821 users of Mapper across 1,289 engagements? Want to become one of them?

Just ask Tyler Whately and Jarrod Mead: As members of the Quantitative Solutions &amp; Technologies group in Tax, they’re reimagining the possible and training others to do the same. The goal: Work smarter, not harder. Training themselves on digital tools like workflows and visualizations helped them analyze large amounts of data to do their tax calculations, and quickly apply the lessons learned to client work. In the end, they streamlined processes and increased productivity. Now they’re helping others to see the potential when you embrace digitization tools. Where’d my paper binder go? Staff and clients need to see the potential of the digital tools and foster an environment where individuals will learn to adapt, automate and create efficiencies. “When I started with the firm, back in 2013, we were still using paper binders,” said Jarrod. “That wasn’t that long ago. Today, I’m helping clients see the value we deliver by using workflows, visualizations and bots in engagements.” Tyler and Jarrod have traditional tax accounting backgrounds, but recognize that how they look at and analyze data has significantly changed. Another benefit they’ve seen from having their teams digitally upskilled is the diversity of ideas brought to the table to solve problems. “We’re getting different perspectives. We need and want that,” said Tyler. Bring on the bots Tyler hosted a training on bot technology to encourage peers to learn the latest technologies and see what’s available on Digital Lab. As part of that training he showed participants how to use the T&amp;E bot: “We take them through something that they would traditionally do through our T&amp;E system and show how using a bot can improve the process,” said Tyler. “It’s all about demystifying the process and helping others to see the possibilities.” Listen to Tyler and Jarrod talk about their “binder-to-bots” journey here!

And how are we scaling automation adoption? With the help of the Tax Automation Center of Enablement (CoE). This team, co-lead by Scott Stein and Scott Skarda, is developing new digital tools to advance our Your Tomorrow - P5M strategic priorities. Two years ago, the Automation CoE started with a team of around 20 people. Today, there are close to 100 people supporting all of Tax. “We scaled the team pretty quickly,” said Kristen, “It was great to have the support of leadership behind us.” And that support has led to some great contributions to the: team’s recent extension automation bot streamlined the prep and printing of over 115 jurisdictions/forms for extensions, saving between 15-20 minutes per form. As a result compliance business units in the partnership and corporate space used this bot to achieve an estimated time savings of 70,000 hours this year. Focusing on high-impact The CoE initially focused on smaller achievements and addressed “low hanging fruit” automations. Many lessons were learned and those early experiences have laid the foundation for the CoE to broaden its focus to even higher-impact automations. “Following a similar approach to our extension bot project, we have a handful of high-impact automations underway, including eFile, Tax Notice Manager, Time Capture Automation and Estimates,” said Scott. In addition to bots, data visualizations and workflows, the Automation CoE is utilizing AI technologies like natural language processing and machine learning with the newer projects. They’re helping business units fill the gaps between the citizen-led work, with the assistance of Digital Accelerators and others on the ground who are promoting automation under enterprise-led initiatives. “We’re constantly focused on results. We’re looking at hours saved and the impact on our people to see what’s the best investment of our time,” said Kristen. Want more? Check out Scott and Kristen on Tax in 10. Listen here.

Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” If you’re looking for a role model who demonstrates the PwC value of “Care,” Chicago International Tax Services (ITS) Manager Angie Unzueta will show you how to go above and beyond. -In November, she led a fundraising effort in her market that raised over $5,000 for the St. Baldrick’s Foundation, focused on childhood cancer research. She also shaved her head to help promote the cause. -When Chicago Partner Ed Bodnam suddenly passed away earlier this year from a heart attack, Partners Barbra Bukovac and Sherry Grabow asked Angie if she’d be interested in helping organize participation in the American Heart Walk taking place in September. Not only is Angie building awareness and managing a team to honor Ed’s memory, but she has also led the group to raise over $13,500 so far. (Interested in joining or supporting the team? Here’s their fundraising page.) -Angie has served as a co-leader for our Latino Inclusion Network (LIN) in Chicago. In the last three years, she has served as the advisor for LIN. “I enjoy coaching — I want to make a difference in our diversity space, help others succeed and contribute to PwC’s inclusive culture” said Angie. “Within LIN, we try to identify what’s important to our diverse staff and the specific challenges they face to then provide them the support to continue succeeding at PwC. People have helped me get to where I am, and I want to do the same by giving back to others.” Angie has been with the firm for seven years in the ITS team, where she started as an intern. “She’s an amazing contributor to our PwC Central Market community,” said Tax Partner Barb Bukovac. “Not only is she interested in helping others through her volunteer efforts, she’s also a really great advocate and coach, especially for our diverse staff.” As for the recognition, Angie says: “I’m flattered! I admire that our Real-time Recognition tool includes ‘Care’ as an area where we provide recognition. It shows PwC truly values caring, and being recognized for that says ‘we value what you’re doing in your community.’” Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I'm Anne Donovan, Managing Director and US People Experience Leader, based out of the Los Angeles office. I’ve been with the firm for 34 years; I’m retiring in January 2020. What's a typical day for you? I travel 60% of the time; when I’m home you can find me on the phone, wearing sweats or PJs, under the watchful gaze of Margaret, my Labradoodle, who is basically a PwC employee at this point. We take lots of walking meetings together. I’m either discussing Be well, work well with our external clients who want to bring it to their organizations, or taking the pulse of our staff to understand how our People initiatives are resonating with them. Engaging with our people by asking how they are feeling about their life at the firm and how we can help them is my main focus every day. How did your journey lead you to this role? I joined client service right out of college, spending two years in Assurance as an auditor before joining Tax for three years and then the Tax Human Capital team, which was called Personnel at the time. From that point onward it’s been total Human Capital immersion! I got involved with anything that fell under the Human Capital umbrella -- whether from a local, regional or xLoS standpoint. My role just kept evolving! A Human Capital strategy role in Assurance led to working on Transformation and now here I am. How does your team bring value to PwC? Through listening to what our people need! Ten years ago, thanks to focus groups and interviews throughout the firm, we learned that our people had a burning desire for a more flexible work environment. The firm took that feedback and ran with it, ultimately changing our culture to be more flexibility friendly -- think jeans, flex days and Virgin Plus rewards! Our team is relentless; whenever the firm goes through a cultural change, like launching Be well, work well, we figure out how it will affect everyone, including what works and what doesn’t. We want to know what our people are thinking and feeling to create a better and more consistent experience. Programs like Be well, work well are changing how we work every day! What are your plans for retirement? Two words: road trip! As soon as I retire I’m taking my siblings on a trip from California to Nova Scotia -- and all spots in between! Thanks to extensive firm travel I’ve seen a lot -- but mostly hotel rooms, airports and meeting rooms. Soon I’ll have time to see the sights and spend it with my family -- I’m so excited! I told my siblings it’s going to be like a “hop on, hop off” bus -- and if we see a town we like we can stay for awhile – maybe even for a few months.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m My Tran, senior manager and learning architect in Learning &amp; Development. I’m based in San Francisco and have been with the firm for nine years. What’s a typical day like for you? I’m always designing or building something! As a learning architect, I create learning solutions for our people. I love how interactive my job is; lots of problem-solving keeps things interesting! From tactical design to technology solutions, finding ways to create programs that enhance the knowledge and development of our people is my passion. I’m like any other architect: I work closely with internal teams to build a “blueprint” of the program design, then confirm that the plans are structurally sound before building the final product. For the past year I’ve spent a lot of time with my team designing the PwC Digital Badge Program*, which is part of Digital Upskilling under Your Tomorrow. How did your journey lead you to this role? As a campus hire, I began as an auditor in Assurance. The firm’s commitment to flexibility and infinite learning was a real draw for me; I received my master’s degree in industrial organizational psychology while working full time. A constant desire to try new things led me to the Learning &amp; Development team. I was excited for a way to bring my master’s degree to life as a learning consultant to our people, which ultimately led to designing and delivering learning solutions around the country. In my current role, I focus on solving complex business problems, including helping to create our first PwC Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Coursera, an online library of courses that are globally available to our people, for free. It’s been a natural progression; each role has led to the next one. Working with my team to help others has always been the best part of my career journey! How does your team bring value to PwC? We love finding ways to transform a creative vision into a reality to solve important problems. Imagine creating a wish list and finding ways to achieve everything on the list. Digital badges are a great example: They tell the digital story of our people, allowing us to be recognized as infinite learners both inside and outside the firm. The beauty of digital badges is they are yours; you can take them with you even if you leave the firm. They show your commitment to your development journey in today’s data-driven culture. We’re so excited to provide a way to tell our digital stories and highlight the skills we acquire throughout our careers. We’re pretty proud of that! What would people be surprised to know about you? I end each week with yoga. Whether indoors or out, yoga is my go-to for relaxing, recharging and reflecting on the day. Another way I recharge is by doing home renovations with my husband. We just completed a two-year overhaul of our house; we gutted everything and rebuilt it from the frame up. So I guess building and design really is in my blood! * Currently the Digital Acumen knowledge badge is available firmwide to partners and staff who complete all four Digital Quests by June 30, 2019. While the full digital badge program is currently only available to Digital Accelerators, it will be rolled out firmwide in FY20.

A few weeks ago, a group of our IFS leaders got together in New York with Tim Ryan and dedicated a full day to thinking about how IFS will continue to think big and reimagine the possible. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for more about our IFS FY20 strategy, how we’ll continue to team across IFS and the firm to enhance our client service, and the role you’ll play in making it all happen. A recurring theme in that meeting was recognition that our IFS teams are already an integral part of driving success and transformative change at our firm. I want you to know how proud I am of the role IFS plays in driving our strategy. Our leaders don’t take for granted the value our IFS teams bring at every turn. A few reminders as we near the end of the fiscal year: As part of our commitment to creating an inclusive culture where all of our people feel a sense of belonging and are valued, this year we rolled out new diversity and inclusion learning experiences across PwC. As our next step, I’m pleased to share that our specialists and administrative professionals across the firm will be invited to an Inclusive Leadership and Belonging webcast. Watch your email for more details after the break. As we all prepare for the firmwide shutdown, remember there are still a few more days to meet our FY19 Digital Upskilling goal. If you haven’t already earned your Digital Acumen knowledge badge, please make every effort to complete your four Digital Quests by June 30. You can access them through the Digital Hub. Speaking of the shutdown — have you packed your bags yet? As part of our commitment to Be well, work well, we need to disconnect from work and take care of ourselves. Plan and take your break, snap a photo and share on social media using #pwctakesabreak. Make sure to have your full name on your profile so you can be included in a random drawing — July 16, Aug. 13 and Sept. 10 — for money you can use to make your next break even more fun. The contest runs through August 20 - read the details here. Before I close, I want to share an example of a team that’s gone above and beyond in living our firm values by caring for others. In case you missed it, our Southeast Market Client Strategy team (KINDa_Contagious) was the IFS grand prize winner of the Habit Refresher Challenge. The team fueled their emotional well-being by paying it forward with small acts of kindness. Then they took it a step further by donating the $10,000 award to schoolchildren in need and encouraging others to join them in spreading kindness. If you have a few minutes, check out the recap video the team produced. I hope you find it as inspiring as I did! Enjoy your time off and thank you, again, for all you’re doing to help drive our success.

Please read the PwC Inside article announcing this change and familiarize yourself with the details of this new policy. And, if you haven’t already, start a conversation with your team about putting processes in place for managing data. PwC is moving away from a “keep everything, forever” mindset, and we each have a responsibility to prepare and adapt to our new ways of working. What does this mean for me, in IFS? In IFS, we create a variety of materials that are critical to firm operations. It’s up to each of us, on our teams and as individuals, to think critically about what’s important to keep, what’s not and for how long — and to make educated decisions to ensure that what should be kept is managed appropriately. Guidelines for data retention in IFS: If you haven’t modified a file in 36 months and it lives in your My Drive, it is very unlikely that it falls into the category of “must keep.” Our business changes rapidly and, generally speaking, we should not be using materials that haven’t been refreshed in over three years. Updating a file — as we should be doing periodically — will “reset” the last modified date for the retention period. You do not need to worry about losing files if you are updating them regularly. Many teams in IFS already have established their own appropriate retention periods, processes and systems for storing business critical records. Consult with your team to make sure you’re following established protocols — or work together to create them as necessary. If your team needs help thinking through and creating the right processes to support your data management needs, please reach out to the Chief Data Office and request a team briefing and consultation. Business critical materials should not be housed in your My Drive or email. If it’s not business critical, you can feel comfortable letting things go in the timeframes outlined in the Google data retention policy. The new policy is in place to automate the process for releasing the data we don’t need and was established in line with best practice industry standards for data retention. We all have a responsibility to be active participants in managing the data lifecycle. That means getting comfortable thinking critically about what’s important for us to keep and what’s not — and ensuring we have the right processes in place to support those decisions. * Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold or part of an exception group.

Update: Since this writing, Jessica has taken up charcoal drawing in addition to oil painting. She enjoys exploring her talent using different mediums and subject matter. Her process time has significantly shortened — from two years to just over two months — to complete a piece. Take another look at Jessica’s inspiring story! Artistic endeavors, no matter the medium, can be great fuel for our mental well-being. Jessica Hosmer, a Geo Marketing manager based in Detroit, took her love of art — and a new interest in painting — and ran with it. All the way to a gallery exhibition. Jessica’s oil painting, titled "Together," was featured at Detroit’s Northville Art House this past January. Jessica was one of only a few students chosen to be part of the show. "It was my first oil painting and it took me two years to complete," she said. The painting, which features Jessica's mother and her best friend working together to tie up the back of her wedding dress, was a labor of love, with significance. "The strings represent my husband and me joining together in marriage on our wedding day, and how the support of my mother and best friend were integral to that day," she said. Jessica’s intricate painting process took two years. She had to paint the piece four separate times, on the same canvas, to hit all of the required nuances. "It was a good life lesson in the end; my passion led me to achieve something — even though I did not know where the journey would lead. I learned to be open and trust my instructors to coach me to achieve my ultimate vision," she said. When art permeates life Jessica’s joy of painting has helped her push through hard times and address issues with perfectionism. "Being chosen as a student to show in exhibitions made me realize I was as good as anyone else — and helped me overcome my mental challenges of whether or not I can succeed," she said. She also painted throughout her recent maternity leave. “Staying close to my passion for art allowed me to prioritize self-care during a time of great change in my life,” she said. “As a working mom, I love that I’m able to follow my dreams, both in my career and in my personal life.” Thanks to recommitting to her love of art — she’s already working on her second oil painting — Jessica feels she’s more centered at work. "It's really about choosing to prioritize and nurture your passion, whatever it is,” she said. “When I learn how to overcome a challenge in painting, I liken it to overcoming a hurdle at work. Focusing on my craft helps me restore a sense of calm, which can really help in hectic times.” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way? Help us tell their #TeamPwC story!

Who’s inspiring you in a unique way? Help us tell their #TeamPwC story! Reach out with your “We are IFS” story ideas. Finance’s Controller Operations team loves to volunteer — in fact, they make it a priority. They dedicate a committee on their Staff Advisory Council to finding worthwhile volunteer opportunities for team members to select from throughout the year. “We open it up to anyone in the Tampa office who wants to join us,” explains Senior Manager Alison Heigel. “We take a very organized approach to volunteering and really get excited about it!” Alison is one of five leaders on the team’s Staff Advisory Council Community Committee who select and organize events for the team. With a wide range of volunteer opportunities to choose from, the Controller Operations team sees a high percentage of participation from many people across the organization. “Sometimes we even get competitive,” says Alison. For “Feeding Tampa Bay,” a local food drive, the team wagered a friendly competition to see who could get the most food donations. “We raised three tons of food in just three weeks,” says Alison. “That’s six carloads of food!” Digital upskilling also played a part. “We even found a fun way to promote our efforts by creating a data visualization of our food drive’s impact,” says Alison. Decorating local foster care facilities for the holidays, making crafts and playing basketball with the kids are other ways they make a difference in the community. In keeping with the holiday spirit, the underserved community in Tampa gets to shop each year at “Holiday Lane,” a special store brimming with toys, books, housewares and clothing. What makes it special? “Everything is free!” explains Alison. “PwCers volunteer as personal shoppers, working in shifts over a two-week period, helping our assigned shoppers select their gifts. The shoppers are so appreciative; we really enjoy seeing the impact we make.” Staying environmentally conscious is another driving force for the team. “Our volunteers have collected trash on several beaches, cleaning up after some major holidays,” says Alison. Working out counts, too. “Each year we run a Be well, work well event where participants take an exercise class of some kind, take a percentage of the fee we contribute and donate it to a charity of our choice.” The team also enjoys volunteering at Junior Achievement events, helping students understand the power of finance and budgeting. “Each year we try new things,” says Alison, “We’ve even raised donations for animal shelters. We look for where we can make the most impact.” Giving back to the community goes hand-in-hand with making meaningful connections with colleagues. “These events allow us to expand our horizons within Finance and beyond,” says Alison. “It’s a wonderful boost for relationships and team building. Plus, it’s an important part of helping us feel like a cohesive work family.” Contact: lu.ann.vispoli@pwc.com Below: Tampa office volunteers get ready to participate in a local charity event.

Communications July 23, 2019 A modest start to 5G adoption The conversation about 5G is heating up as more markets come online. Select customers in select cities have access to 5G and announcements are breaking weekly. How far has 5G come? With what velocity will the rollout continue? PwC’s US 5G Mobile Index is here! PwC’s US telecom industry panel provides its estimate for 5G progress to date and six months into the future. We will update figures periodically as 5G devices become available and more markets come online. Our analysis conducted as of July 1, 2019 finds we are just off the starting block. Less than 1% of the US population has 5G coverage available at their home or business. And less than 0.5% of mobile devices in use are 5G enabled. It is the intersection of these two data points that reflect the US 5G marketplace. The road ahead is a very long one and in many ways more complex than it was for prior mobile generations. As we look out six months to January 1, 2020, we predict 10% of the US population will have access to 5G network coverage and 2% of devices will be 5G enabled. What’s the hold up to adoption? Building a 5G network is different from 4G because of the inherent specifications of the technology. It requires a higher density network that has regulatory, cost and operational challenges, including the installation of hundreds of thousands of small cells across the country. It requires large bands of spectrum that are not currently available. Deploying 5G is immensely costly and at the moment consumers aren’t demanding (or willing to pay much more for it). And, 5G devices aren’t yet widely available. 5G promises to supercharge the connectivity experience, and upend the way we digest media, purchase products and services, and even operate our homes and businesses. But the use cases are far from real and wireless operators have work to do to make 5G pay. Industry collaboration among value chain players is uncomfortable for many and presents yet another impediment to innovation. Why it matters As the 4th Industrial Revolution comes of age, enterprise users of 5G are beginning to question what 5G means for their business. The answer varies -- for some companies, very little, for others, a whole lot. Companies who are taking a customer-led, experience-driven approach to business transformation may find the challenges they face today and the innovation they aspire toward for tomorrow do not depend on 5G, which is a good thing. Because one thing is certain, the tipping point for 5G is a ways out. According to SNS Telecom &amp; IT, around the year 2026, small cell shipments for 4G/LTE shipments start to decline year-over-year, and 5G continues to grow rapidly. And by 2030, it reaches a tipping point when 5G shipments is expected to exceed 4G/LTE small cell shipments*. For wireless operators, 5G presents an opportunity to devise new business models, as well as improve their operating efficiency.

Check out the internal and external communities below for answers to your burning questions and to advance your skills. Please remember that client-specific information should never be shared in internal or external communities. How do I sign up for a virtual one-on-one session? 1. Decide which digital tool/topic you need help with (data wrangling, data visualization, or intelligent process automation). 2. Select the appropriate calendar shown below. 3. Select a date and time that is available and works for you. Appointments that already have someone's name assigned in the calendar are not available. Select another date and time. 4. Click on the appointment you want to sign up for in the calendar. 5. Click on "copy to my calendar". This will save the session on your calendar with the meeting information included. 6. Fill out the request form to secure the session and share more about your digital support needs.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/vn-904-naveen-test.html</url><pwc_title>VN-904 Naveen Test</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-11-19 02:42:59</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>news-type:Firmwide</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-10-24 00:19:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time>2019-10-23 23:59:00</pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>VN-904 Naveen Test VN-904 Naveen Test Oct. 23, 2019 Top News Key Dates</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/vn-829-accordiantest.html</url><pwc_title>VN-829 AccordianTest</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-09-16 23:26:59</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>VN-829 AccordianTest VN-829 AccordianTest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/padding.html</url><pwc_title>Padding</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-08-27 01:46:30</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:Tax</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-08-27 01:18:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Padding Padding Aug. 26, 2019 A smile costs nothing, but gives a lot. It enriches those who receive it without making poorer those who give it. A smile takes only a moment, but the memory of it can last forever. No one is so rich, or so mighty, that they can get a long without a smile. And no one is so poor that they cannot be made richer by a smile. A smile creates happiness in the home, fosters goodwill in business and is the counter sign of friendship. A smile brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad and is nature’s best cure for trouble Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen for it is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give a smile so give them one of yours as no one needs a smile so much as he who has no more of his own to give.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/tagdriven_assurance.html</url><pwc_title>TagDriven_Assurance</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-07-24 22:48:53</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:Assurance</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-07-24 22:48:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>TagDriven_Assurance TagDriven_Assurance July 24, 2019</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/vn---753-personalized-news-feed---sector-and-los-and-sublos2--.html</url><pwc_title>VN -

People magazine recognized PwC in its annual “50 Companies That Care” list, and we’re No. 6 , up from No. 42 last year! To identify Companies That Care, People partnered with Great Place to Work®. Rankings are based on surveys representing over 4.5 million employees’ experiences of how their workplaces have made a difference in their lives and in their communities. Rankings also reflect Great Place to Work's assessment of the generosity of each organization's benefits, philanthropic and community support, with particular focus on activities occurring in the last year. Our continued investment on diversity and inclusion, well-being and Responsible Business Leadership, and Digital Upskilling through Your Tomorrow — reinforced by our purpose and values — underscores our commitment to create a place where everyone is supported and encouraged to become the best version of themselves. Through the survey responses, here’s what was heard: We offer generous benefits and wellness perks. We provide generous leave policies and an innovative phased return-to-work program. We offer an unprescribed number of sick days for eligible staff, to take time off for their own illness or injury. We support our people in times of need. The PwC Charitable Foundation, Inc. makes contributions to our people and their immediate families in times of unexpected financial hardship. It also helps fund charitable organizations where our people volunteer. We listen and build trust. We’ve held hundreds of Inclusive Leadership and Belonging sessions. They are helping us learn what we can do to make the experience for every person at PwC even better. We continue to lead the way on this and are doing our part as individuals and a firm through the CEO Action “I Act On” pledge to personally commit to support inclusion and driving action at PwC and in our communities. We make flexibility and well-being work … every day. We know that flexibility is good for both our people and our business. Our people have the flexibility they need where, when and how they work. And we’re committed to a focus on well-being through Be well, work well, as part of our caring culture. Volunteerism is at the heart of our giving culture. As part of our Responsible Business Leadership strategy, we encourage our people to volunteer for activities that are important to them. We couldn’t have earned this recognition without building an exceptional culture together — one that inspires all of us to deliver our best. We’re excited to see our contributions have an impact, and that we’re making a difference for our clients, our communities and one another.

Is your client asking about information security? Network Information Security June 7, 2019 We all work with information every day — and we each play a role in protecting the information entrusted to PwC, whether it belongs to our clients, our business or our people. The Information Security Policy (ISP) Controls Standard outlines the minimum security baselines with which all partners and staff must comply. This short ISP Training video provides a quick overview. The ISP is designed to help protect PwC from threats by safeguarding and maintaining the integrity of PwC and client information, meeting relevant legal, professional and regulatory obligations, and ensuring the PwC brand is protected. It also includes supporting standards and guidance that help us understand how our day-to-day responsibilities contribute to keeping our client and firm information safe.

Together, these changes will drive value, efficiency and a more digital and consistent experience for our partners and staff. On June 21 we held a 30 minute Q&amp;A webcast for Tax staff to hear more and ask questions about Workday. Watch the replay here, or check out the Workday FAQs for additional information. What is Workday? At the firmwide town hall on May 21, we shared that we’re reintroducing upward and peer feedback functionality through Workday, our new global, mobile and cloud-based human capital system. In addition, our introduction of “Development Teams” -- comprised of a Career Coach, Relationship Leader, and, for client service associates and senior associates, Connectivity Partner -- will forge stronger connections that support growth and development.

Please begin submitting your Tax GDM reservations for all of calendar year 2019 into Phoenix now. All reservations should be submitted by Friday, November 30. This will be our first year utilizing Phoenix, and there are several time saving changes to the submission process, which are detailed below. You do not need to have new WBS codes or current engagement letters in place to set up your reservations. Reservations are now a one-step process, and you no longer have to await approval of your engagement to move forward with planning your hours. Also, as part of our more simplified approach to managing restrictions, when your engagement letter includes (or will include) the standard template language regarding the use of subcontractors or offshore resources, please mark ‘YES’ to the 7216 question. In those instances where the language has been or is expected to be modified, you should select “NO,” and you may receive a follow-up email to provide a copy of your Engagement Letter. Within the forecasting section of reservation/engagement creation, you will notice we provide options for auto populating your spread of hours. When you add your service(s) you will need to differentiate between the Review Level requested by adding additional rows under the service (i.e., if you are requesting both preparation and Senior Review for a service, a line with corresponding hours for each should be added separately). Providing this detail is crucial to managing your engagement with the SDC: failing to update this detail may cause delays in starting your engagement. This information may need to be updated throughout the life of your engagement if details change. Helpful reminders: You need to create new engagement/reservations for each Tax year. The custom engagement name should begin with the Tax year such as ‘2018 Federal Compliance.’ Future enhancements will allow you to roll over your Engagements year to year minimizing input! When creating your Engagement within Phoenix please use the Client and Engagement name exactly as recorded in FlexForecast. When adding Team Members to the engagement, ensure your Engagement Partner is added to the “Engagement Partner” role during creation. This facilitates the timely capture of hours against the partner’s GDM projections. Separate Engagement/reservations are needed for each Engagement Partner within a client. Make sure to complete the forecasting with your best estimate of the weekly hours when you need SDC resources. Your reservations cannot be allocated to an SDC without this. The hours reserved should tie in total to those included as GDM hours in FlexForecast. Number of items is not required at time of reservation, but will be required prior to requesting any services to be performed. As the details regarding the work request (timing, forecast, budgeting, etc.) change throughout the engagement, please update Phoenix accordingly and notify your delivery team via email or call. Please note, the Engagement/reservation will remain unable to be edited until a supervisor is assigned and the Engagement becomes “active”. Until then, the status will show as “under review.” GDM Information reporting work will now be reserved with your core Tax reservations using the practice areas of AWM and GIR as appropriate. We will no longer be using the Information Reporting Database. For PCS and PFS work please look for further guidance regarding how to utilize the Engagement Center Workflow integration for forecast submission. If you are interested in discussing more about what GDM can do for your team, please reach out to Katherine Totah (AWM), David Saracino (Corp), Laura Abadie (PCS), Melody Nundy (SALT) and Joseph Frey (any other services) for more details, or visit our TaxSource page. Tax GDM is excited to work with your team as we deliver our future together! You can also visit the Tax Global Delivery Model Tax Source site for information on SDC Activities, Phoenix Resources, FAQs, Key Contacts, and more.

Visit Real-time recognition today A new way to give kudos. Visit Real-time recognition today People Team Oct. 25, 2018 Thanks to everyone who recognized a colleague (monetary or non-monetary), downloaded the Globoforce app from PwC’s App Store and congratulated someone on the Recognition activity feed by Oct. 8. These individuals are not only living our values, but were also entered into a random drawing to win a $350 Real-time recognition award -- here are the 10 lucky winners. ◆ George Mantas - Chicago ◆ Rian Oosthuizen - Atlanta ◆ Kelly Groark - Seattle ◆ Ryan Wheeler - New York ◆ Koren D'Angelo - Chicago ◆ Stella Bleikhman - New York ◆ Mandy Junge - Phoenix ◆ Trevor Roberts - Atlanta ◆ Michelle Klieman - Chicago ◆ Valerie Thannisch - Dallas Since Real-time recognition launched nearly a month ago, you’ve sent out ~14,000 recognition awards. Keep it going and make gratitude part of your daily routine. You can access Real-time recognition today via myKcurve, the “PwC External Links” worklet in Workday, and in PwC’s App Store via the Globoforce mobile app. Tips for making the most of your recognition experience: Budget (if eligible): To promote more-frequent recognition, annual budgets were split into two periods for the performance year -- your budget will replenish on Jan. 17, 2019, so you’ll need to use your current balance by Jan. 16. You cannot borrow against the second budget during this first spend period. Spending balance: View your balance via PC during the recognition process. After clicking “Recognize,” search for the colleague you wish to award, then select the award reason and you’ll see your spending balance. (This feature is not yet available in the app -- but is on the roadmap of enhancements with our vendor.) Privacy settings: You can change your Recognition default privacy setting if you’d prefer it not to appear on the recognition activity feed (the “social feed”). Simply go to My dashboard → My settings, and scroll to the bottom to modify your privacy. Please note: Once an award is made private it cannot be changed to shared. However, a shared award can always be changed to private. Please do not share client names or confidential information in your recognition message or congratulatory message in the Recognition activity feed. If client names are included, the administrators will make the award private. Have additional questions? Visit the Real-time recognition site.

Good news! Rapid Engage will make your life easier — entering similar information across multiple systems, confusion about next steps and uncertainty about the timing of code release are things of the past. Rapid Engage is available to everyone, so access the tool now. Simply search for any opportunity name in the tool, and you’ll be able to see the status of your engagement startup and help keep the processes moving. What is Rapid Engage? Rapid Engage is designed to help you get from opportunity identification to WBS code release faster. Think of those “pizza trackers” that allow customers to watch their pizza status as it moves from order, to oven and out for delivery. Rapid Engage is designed with that transparency — and ease of use — in mind. The tool overlays our existing client acceptance and engagement start-up systems (including A&amp;C, AFS, engagement contracts, budget tools, myEngage and others), providing one interface that helps you complete required process steps and track your progress. How does it work? Rapid Engage doesn’t change our existing client acceptance policies and procedures — it just makes the entire process easier and more streamlined for you. Once you're in the tool, check out the detailed tutorial video below to learn more about how it works. Once an opportunity moves beyond the Target stage in Salesforce, it automatically displays on the Rapid Engage landing page for all opportunity team members listed in Salesforce and any additional team members added in the Engagement Details tab. Once an opportunity is in Rapid Engage, one of your first steps should be to provide basic information about the engagement and team in the “Engagement Details.” Rapid Engage will then go into action, triggering the remaining engagement start-up steps for you. (You should no longer launch your own Engagement Acceptance or Authorization for Services forms.) The additional beauty of Rapid Engage is that you can work on multiple engagement start-up steps at the same time. Note: For new clients, the client acceptance steps will also have to be marked as complete for Rapid Engage to kick off remaining steps. (Check out our Rapid Engage FAQs for more on these steps.) Clicking on an individual opportunity takes you to the Client Details tab, where all required client and engagement start-up steps are outlined based on the client type, restriction status and proposed service. The tool auto-initiates forms and pre-populates some required fields based on the information you’ve already provided, and continues to guide you all the way through code creation and release.

Wince-proof your profile with the Are you guilty of LinkedIn cringers? Wince-proof your profile with these 7 tips People Team July 16, 2018 As we begin our new performance year, take a few minutes to update your LinkedIn profile with your latest skills, experiences and interests. Be sure your profile is the best reflection of who you are and the value you deliver to the firm. With over 350 million professionals on LinkedIn, it’s important to have a strong profile that stands out. Try these seven tips to strengthen your profile. 1. Name and headline: Include your full name and title. This is not the place for nicknames or humorous references to job titles (such as “audit allstar” or “communications ninja”). The 120-character limit is the most important aspect of your profile. Be succinct, creative, and include key terms that make it easy for others to understand your industry and your role. 2. Customized URL: On your profile page, find your unique URL in the light-grey box below your name. Click the edit button and revise. 3. Profile photo: First impressions matter. That goes for business meetings and profile pictures. And research shows that a professional photo on your LinkedIn profile can result in 14x more profile views. Use a professional photographer, look personable, use most of the frame, and choose a familiar picture. Remember: LinkedIn is not Facebook. 4. Background and summary: Write a succinct description, including your business ambitions. Add other points of contact, including mobile number, Twitter URL, email address, etc. Also, adding media to the summary supports credibility. Provide links to slides, videos, podcasts, blog posts and more. Be precise in describing past and current job descriptions. Keep it positive, and highlight your skills and accomplishments. 5. Connections and groups: Try to make (at least) 300 connections -- but fewer than 3,000. Be strategic in making connections with coworkers, peers in your industry, and present and past clients and customers. Join groups to maximize LinkedIn’s networking potential, and utilize the ability to contact other group members. 6. Ask for and give recommendations: Almost 60% of people consult friends and family for purchasing decisions. More recommendations equals more business. Add more credibility to your profile by asking your most important, notable colleagues and employers to write a recommendation. LinkedIn will display the two most recent recommendations received. 7. Make sure your profile is 100% complete: Only 51% of LinkedIn users have 100% completed profiles. But users with complete profiles are 40x more likely to receive opportunities through LinkedIn. That’s because LinkedIn’s search algorithm seeks and displays results by profile completeness first. For more information, check out our LinkedIn One Stop Shop where you’ll find trainings, tools and tips to create an effective profile and build your network.

As you read in Tim Ryan’s article in today’s PwC Inside, our business is strong and Your Tomorrow is coming to life across the firm. As we head into the second half of our fiscal year, we in IFS have important milestones to celebrate -- and more opportunities than ever to develop professionally and to contribute to the firm’s success. On that note, please join me in congratulating our 294 IFS colleagues who were promoted to the next staff level during Q1 and Q2. Let’s wish them all the best as they take on new roles and responsibilities. We’re making excellent progress toward our goal of becoming a truly digital organization and upskilling ourselves personally. Let’s keep the excitement and momentum going by taking advantage of all the resources available below. As Tim said, “The more time we invest, the more skilled we become!” Thank you to each of you for all you’re doing to make a difference for IFS and our firm. In FY19, PwC will realize our goal of becoming a truly digital organization -- and you play an important role. Let’s keep our focus on these three areas: Your work to embed One Firm behaviors and thinking across IFS and the firm continues to make a difference. Let’s keep breaking down silos and working together to tackle challenges in new and innovative ways. Consider all lines of service and IFS in your planning, and promote the use of One Firm tools whenever possible. And if you haven’t yet, take a few minutes to explore our IFS site to better connect across IFS teams. Thanks to all of our IFS team members who have been involved in launching continuous improvement efforts across the firm this year. Some recent examples include new and enhanced tools that are making it easier to build your professional brand online, to share our digital journey with clients and to activate our PwC brand in the market. Our reimagined Social Central (powered by Dynamic Signal) lets you easily share timely, PwC-approved content with your social networks, while our simplified brand guidelines make it a snap to work with our visual elements in today’s mobile-first, digital environment. We’re also sharing our Digital Story with clients, allowing them to customize the content they receive from us through our new preference center, and embedding more digital assets into our proposal process through the Proposal Center of Excellence. During our IFS All Hands webcast last month, we focused on the specifics of how we’re digitizing the firm and upskilling ourselves through Your Tomorrow. IFS has embraced these opportunities with enthusiasm and we’re in a great position to go even further in the second half of FY19. Digital Upskilling: More than 1,300 of us in IFS have already completed the second Digital Quest, the BankSure Project, now live in the Digital Hub. Don’t delay in getting started on this one! You’ve got extra incentive -- up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition -- with the Learn2earn challenge if you complete all four Digital Quests, and earn 150 points in Digital Lab, by April 30. And don’t worry, our deadline to complete all four Digital Quests and earn your Digital Acumen knowledge badge is still June 30 -- Learn2earn just provides a little extra incentive to get it done early! If you need a refresher on the Digital Upskilling resources available to help you prepare for the Digital Quests, check out this helpful guide to Digital Quests, Digital Hub, Digital Lab, Digital Academies and more. Don’t miss the top 5 most popular Digital Lab automations for IFS and catch up with the IFS team that keeps Digital Lab running. Finally, a few reminders: You can start planning for the return of the July 4 week firmwide shutdown. You told us last year that you loved having the time off and that the only thing that could make it even better was more time to plan -- so we’re letting you know now! You’ve still got a few days to show your appreciation with the first half of your annual Real-time recognition budget. Use your balance by Jan. 16, or you will lose it. Managers to managing directors who were unable to attend an in-office Inclusive Leadership and Belonging at PwC session can now access those sessions virtually. February 4-6: IFS team members promoted to manager and above in FY18 will gather in Orlando for our inaugural IFS Leadership Milestone Experience.

For instance, a handy map or weather app could be tracking your location. Additionally, app developers can collect and monetize personal information (in addition to just your location) and sell it to unknown third parties. If those apps are unsecure or experience a data breach, your data can end up in cybercriminals’ hands. Where and how you live, work, shop and more could be used for malicious purposes. At PwC, restrictions on our Google accounts protect our data. For example, external digital assistants (like Siri or Alexa) can’t connect to your PwC account. However, depending on your device settings, your personal data could be exposed. 3 things you can do today to protect your privacy on your mobile device 1. Disable app location services or set location tracking for only when the app is being used: o Adjust location services and GPS for specific applications on iOS devices. o Manage your location settings and choose which apps use your location for Android. 2. Select if (or when) apps can use your phone’s microphone: o iOS users, go to Settings → Privacy → Microphone to disable. o Android users, go to Settings → Apps &amp; notifications → App permissions. 3. Review an app’s terms of agreement and/or privacy notice on what information is collected and how it is used.

Later that night the doctor told him he blew out his knee. Little did he know, the worst was yet to come. “The injury I sustained on the football field was life altering in a lot of ways,” Dustin reflected. “My leg became seriously infected and it took 13 surgeries over two years to save my life and recover fully. I went from pep rallies to being homeschooled. My aspirations to play collegiate sports came to an abrupt end.” While many things in Dustin’s life changed during this tumultuous time, his eating habits did not. “Even though the injury kept me on the sidelines, I was still acting in some ways as if I were an active athlete. As a result, some unhealthy habits followed me throughout college.” Then in 2008, he joined PwC. About eight months into his first year with the firm, Dustin scheduled an Executive Health Exam (EHE). Following his appointment, Dustin had a revelation: “I was living to work versus working to live. That needed to change. Even when I got away from work, I didn’t have any energy left in the tank to enjoy my time off,” he said. Dustin began to work out early in the morning at his client’s site. Slowly, he adopted healthy habits and changed his lifestyle. To date, Dustin has lost 130 pounds! After learning a few things the hard way, Dustin is paying it forward by sharing tips to help others Be well, work well and bring their best selves to work. As a Talent Acquisition Leader, Dustin makes it a point to talk about well-being with prospective hires. “It’s created a buzz on campuses,” he said. “Entry-level talent says our focus on well-being is a differentiator and is an example of how we live our PwC values every day.” Dustin uses the Habit Bank to keep health and well-being a top priority -- and he’s also seen a difference in the energy level of his own team. He calls their energy “contagious” and says it generates a multiplier effect. For those still struggling to adopt healthy habits, Dustin offered this advice, “Life is a rollercoaster, but try to find balance one week at a time. Be stronger than your excuse -- make yourself a priority.” Check out Dustin’s blog post on LinkedIn to learn more about his inspirational story and well-being tips. We wish Dustin continued success! #Bewellworkwell Partners, staff and their spouse/domestic partner with primary coverage under the PwC UnitedHealthcare medical plan can use EHE for an annual preventive exam at no cost (10 months must elapse between EHE exams).

While driving efficiency to reduce our absolute carbon impact, we’re committing to offsetting air travel emissions from FY19, sourcing 100% renewables for our electricity consumption, and offsetting residual energy use by FY22. These actions encompass what we’re doing in the US -- building on many years of action here and in other territories. We’re proud that Access Your Potential, our $320 million investment to teach 10 million underserved students the tech and money skills they need to succeed, is an essential piece of the global community ambition. You can be a part of it by helping students develop these critical skills at an upcoming Access Your Potential event — find one near you here by zip code search. On the environment side, we are well on our way. We’ve been sourcing 100% of our electricity consumption with renewable energy since 2015, and we will be offsetting 100% of air travel emissions starting this fiscal year.

You need to know about changes to the process One Firm Risk Organization April 1, 2019 As we begin our e-filing season, new state e-file requirements related to application software updates will impact our internal e-file process. This requirement mandates that once an e-file has been created, you have 10 business days after the next software release to submit. This requirement, which has been adopted by most states, applies to every tax software vendor (CCH, Thomson, Corptax, etc). Its purpose is to reduce the error rate of returns filed without the latest updates and ensures a more consistent standard throughout the software industry. What this means to you If you calculate a return on one release, you have 10 business days after the next release to transmit the return to the IRS. Once those 10 business days have passed, the return has "expired," and will not be transmitted. (See list of which states can expire for electronic filing due to the 10 Business Day Rule for State electronic filing.) Any e-file not transmitted within this window will need to be re-created before submitting. For Thomson users, e-files submitted after this window will receive an Error Not Submitted message with specific diagnostic message. To resolve, simply re-create and re-submit the e-file. CCH will have similar diagnostic errors and process to re-create the e-file. Consider this example timeline: February 3: An Alabama e-file is created on version 18-2.3 February 8: Version 18-3 of the software is released. February 11: The Alabama return is reviewed and Form 8879 is sent for signature. February 15: Form 8879 signed is received and e-file is submitted. Since the return was filed within 10 business days of the subsequent release, it will be accepted given it passes all e-file rules/rejects. February 25: All e-file returns created on version 18-2.3 must be regenerated prior to e-filing. This is 10 business days after the release date on February 8 because Monday, February 18 is an official holiday. Excluded States The states below are excluded, as they do not have this requirement stated in their Letter of Intent for E-file. This list is subject to change based on the state’s requirements. As a reminder, only state returns are impacted, not federal. 1040 1120 1065 1041 California Alaska Alaska California Indiana California California Michigan Michigan Florida Indiana Minnesota Minnesota Indiana Michigan New Mexico New Mexico Michigan Minnesota New York New York Minnesota New Mexico Philadelphia NPT New York City New Mexico New York Ohio Generic City New York New York City Ohio RITA City New York City Ohio RITA City Philadelphia NPT Philadelphia BRT Philadelphia BRT Questions?

Check out our 2018 Global D Looking for a formula for digital success? Check out our 2018 Global Digital IQ Survey Advisory Nov. 15, 2018 Since 2007, we’ve surveyed executives from around the world on their organization’s digital acumen. When we started, digital and IT were synonymous. Today, just like with Your Tomorrow here at PwC, digital has taken on a much more powerful definition. This year we surveyed over 2,200 business, experience and technology executives in 60 countries to measure their digital acumen and find out how they’re investing and delivering on digital. What did we learn? Executives had four different aspirations for digital -- from redefining an entire company to wringing efficiencies. But when it comes to what makes them successful, the top performing companies* identified shared clear commonalities: More than half of the top performers said their leadership is digitally savvy and helps the workforce think in a new way. 91 percent have an executive in charge of digital employee experience. Almost two-thirds regularly expose employees to new cross-functional teams to increase their digital skills and knowledge. About three-quarters said their digital investments have paid off in combatting new industry entrants. What does this tell us? Doing digital right means different things for different companies. But, across the board, it does mean companies may need to adopt new ways of working. What trends make companies successful? Here are a few: Their leaders not only embrace digital in words, but also in actions and behaviors. They've invested both money and thought into how they recruit, train and retain talent and into how their employees work with each other. They place a high value on digital experience -- for employees and for customers. They're aware of the ripples of disruption all around them and use data, analytics and new ways of innovating to keep ahead of it. These findings also show that our investments in digital upskilling to drive our Your Tomorrow strategy have the potential to benefit the firm and align with what our customers need from us in the future.

One recent example: Transfer Pricing partner Kevin Daly, customs director Mathew Mermigousis and associate Cody Kahrs in the Detroit office identified publicly available customs data for their client, a major automotive supplier, and using the Benchmark Tool from Digital Lab created a graphic illustrating how US tariffs on Chinese and European imports were affecting the company. When they flashed the data visualization onscreen, the graphic caught the Chief Financial Officer’s attention, and he immediately wanted to know more about customs and how they were affecting the company’s bottom line. In no time, Advisory joined in, adding the supply chain angle, and specialists from the Risk &amp; Regulation platform brought their customs knowledge. Kevin, Mathew and Cody say creating the data visualization took ten minutes but reinvented the way they approach their transfer pricing clients. They -- and their global trade teammates -- have started using this approach with other non-audit clients across the firm. Not only does that story reflect our strategy in action — One Firm, Your Tomorrow, P5M and Platforms — it also demonstrates how cool it is to work at PwC. No matter your staff level, when you lean in, you can make a difference. In this season of self-Snapshots, Career Roundtables and Outlook discussions, it’s a good time to reflect on how the firm can help you learn new things and how you, in turn, can contribute to our future. Speaking of making a difference, I’d like to congratulate the following Tax partners who have taken on new roles to help our teams execute on the Your Tomorrow - P5M strategy and deliver the Client Experience. Thank you for your innovation, dedication, and the care you show each other and our clients -- you truly inspire me to live our PwC values.

Salesforce offers big advantages in every competitive proposal. Managers and above: use Chatter to team more effectively in discussing potential opportunities. Running our business While the Tax practice was under budget this quarter, revenue is growing at 6% over prior year. We need strong growth in the 4th quarter to finish FY19 on budget. Fun fact: Competitive proposals supported by NPT result in wins almost 60% of the time — almost twice the rate of all other competitive Tax proposals. Let’s finish the fiscal year strong by logging every opportunity in Salesforce and reaching out to the National Pursuit Team (NPT) for help. If you just finished busy season, now is a great time to make sure our work is documented in DMS, your WIPs are billed and invoices are collected. If you are doing (or already did) extra work related to Tax Reform, don’t forget to review your engagement letter or SOW (executing an addendum to cover the additional out-of-scope work if necessary) and bill accordingly to capture that additional effort.

Please plan to attend a 60 minute training on April 26 at 1:30 p.m. ET as we discuss improvements and expectations for how to use the site. This training has been added to your calendar (or click here April 26). Please note: CPE is offered for those who attend the live webcast. A recording will be made available for those unable to attend live (CPE not available). Each market’s DC/PM Driver will also host a 30 minute in-person training as a follow-up to this webcast. Invitations will come from your local market team.

IFS Team, We had another fantastic turnout for Tuesday’s IFS All Hands webcast -- over 4,000 of you joined! If you missed it, please take time to watch the *replay and read on for a recap of webcast highlights and links to all the helpful resources discussed. We’ve also shared below the video that played at the beginning of the event. As we heard Tuesday, Your Tomorrow is about digitizing our firm -- and that means creating opportunities for you to learn, grow and succeed so we can deliver the experience our clients want. Making digital upskilling and automation work for you, no matter your role or title, is a journey worth taking. It can take many different forms, as our panelists shared. I also hope you were as inspired as I was by our segment on creating an inclusive culture in IFS and the strategies we all can use in our everyday lives. (See below for links and resources.) As we heard during the webcast, it’s not just about inviting others to the party; it’s about asking them to dance! As we approach the end of our fiscal year, a few requests. Take some time to make the I Act On pledge and tap into the many Diversity &amp; Inclusion resources available. Work with your coach and Relationship Leader to map your own digital upskilling journey. And, take all four Digital Quests to earn your Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30. (Even better, complete your Quests by April 30, along with earning 150 points in Digital Lab, for a chance at $1,000 in Real-time Recognition -- 1 in 7 will win!) Our IFS team is critical to helping PwC execute against our strategy and continues to be a key driver of PwC’s success. Thank you for your enthusiasm and dedication! More to know In a segment on Your Tomorrow, Alex Chen, managing director for Global Delivery Model Services, drove home how digital upskilling provides us with the opportunity to reach our potential in a world that’s not slowing down. Alex interviewed Dmitriy Meleshko, Fabiola Nuñez and Bryant Pena who shared helpful lessons learned from their own digital upskilling efforts and brought to life specific examples of how automation impacts their day-to-day work by saving time and improving processes. Check out all the resources Alex and team referenced: Visit the Digital Hub, get to know Digital Lab, and work with your Coach and Relationship Leader to plan your own digital upskilling journey, including goals for FY20.

As you’ll read in the updates below, we are successfully executing for our clients, our teams, and our firm in more ways than one. We’re bringing the power of One Firm and Advisory 2.0 initiatives -- whether it be digital upskilling, BXT, Integrated Solutions -- and we’re making a lasting impact. While I know that there are a lot of moving pieces, what I want to reinforce is that this is all about reshaping how we work so that we’re prepared for the future, along with what our markets and clients demand. Each part of our strategy connects back to working differently -- evolving our capabilities so that we are the best consultants in the profession. With each step we take, we’re reaching a significant milestone that either enhances what we deliver to our clients, empowers our people to bring their ideas to life, or increases our position against the competition. And you all are making that possible -- THANK YOU! We’ll be talking more about our accomplishments, performance year-end, and what comes next at our Q4 Advisory All Hands next month. I’ll be following up in the next couple of weeks with an invitation so stay tuned for more details. In the meantime, please feel free to reach out with your thoughts and questions. Once again, thank you for all you’re doing for our practice and I look forward to catching up with you all soon, ● Delivering as One Firm: The Scheduler Bot ○ Scheduling meetings sucks up too much time that we could be spending to create more value for clients, the firm, or put back into ourselves. TMT Advisory Manager, Kevin Batista and Experienced Tax Associate, Travis Mercante recognized this problem, built a solution, and have unlocked $82K in savings, or +1.7% in margin for a 12-month project. They’re also answering the call from our clients who are challenging us to show them our value in new ways, and giving back time to their colleagues...all because of an idea. Kevin uploaded a problem statement about scheduling meetings to the Digital Lab and Travis took on the challenge to automate. In less than two hours, The Scheduler was developed -- a UiPath based solution that automates the steps required to draft or send multiple meeting invites, using Native MS Outlook functionality. It’s now being used on a $4.9M project by one of our Comcast project teams. Prior to the bot, an associate spent an average of 8 hours scheduling meetings each week. With this automation, that associate populates the required data fields in a spreadsheet and the bot takes care of the rest. ● Supporting our practice: As we work to execute on our One Firm and Advisory 2.0 strategies, we’ve made updates to our GEP, APP and Advisory Leadership teams. ● Delivering Q3 results: Q3 FYTD, total Advisory ACM was favorable to budget by $31.6M (+1.7%), as was engagement margin of 28.7% (3.0 pts above budget and 1.3 pts improved over prior year). Revenue of $4.2B was less than (1%) below budget, and client utilization is below budget by 1.0 pt at 67.9%. Let’s keep up the momentum this quarter to have a strong close to FY19. ● Investing in our business: ○ Our Integrated Solutions and focus on Platforms continue to drive significant impact on our Advisory business as our engagement teams bring our playbooks to our clients. In FY19, we’ve already generated $1.9B in wins from our Integrated Solutions, with a pipeline of $2.8B and a win rate that continues to grow. Need to see it in action? Check out how we partnered with Tax and others to help Microsoft prevent a $1B loss using our Finance Transformation Integrated Solution, a One Firm approach, and creating a Magic Moment. ● Investing in you: ○ BXT training is taking the markets by storm! Look out for communications from our BXT team as BXT Immersions and Incubators make their way to your home markets over the next few months. Click here for upcoming dates, locations and details. ○ Integrated Solutions training is available -- take advantage of these materials to learn how we’re differentiating ourselves in the market, and the Integrated Solutions that align with your teams. ● Attending Digital Academies: 84% of Advisory staff have attended a Digital Academy! Now that we’ve learned the basics, here’s what we need to do next to bring this to life on our Advisory engagements: ○ Bring the digital conversation to the start of your engagements and question whether your team can be more efficient by using automations. ○ Go into Digital Lab to find available automations that you might be able to use on your engagements, now that you have Academy training. ○ Think of ideas you can contribute to the Digital Lab -- what’s missing that we could really use today? ● Completing the Challenge: Don’t miss out! The Learn2earn challenge deadline is approaching: ○ Complete all four Digital Quests by April 30 (Note: Our goal as a firm is still to complete these quests and earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30). ○ Earn 150 points by April 30 as an active member of the Digital Lab community, by contributing to and/or using the resources of Digital Lab. Everyone who successfully completes the challenge will be entered into a raffle for up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win (you can read the contest rules here). ● Capturing your impact: Speaking of upskilling, as you complete your Snapshots by the April 30 deadline, make sure your efforts don’t go unnoticed: ○ Learn best practices to capture your digital upskilling efforts in your Snapshots. ○ Get an inside look at CRTs, Career Roundtables, and other performance year-end activities. ● A few additional reminders: ○ Don’t forget to use your Real-time recognition balance by June 27. ○ Check the credits you need to meet the June 30 CPE Deadline.

One Firm Risk Organization May 2, 2019 One of the important steps at the end of an engagement or project is to appropriately complete the documentation of the work that has been performed and securely store both hard and electronic copies of engagement information to be retained. Including the following steps in the engagement signoff process may save you time and could reduce the firm's risk: 1- Review any legal, regulatory or contractual requirements associated with your specific engagement (including any OGC Preservation Notices). Check the Retention Type for your engagement and ensure it correctly indicates the type of engagement. If you have any questions, review the U.S. firm's Records Management and Document Retention policy and the Tax Documentation policy. 2- Remove any electronic information for the engagement from places it may be stored, including email, laptop, shared drives, Google Drive, Team Drive, etc. and place in relevant document repositories (e.g., DMS, AURA and Map). 3- Review the DMS file and consider removing some of the staff’s access, if no longer required. See Confidentiality and DMS Access policy. 4- Promptly file in the Records Center hard copy work papers that cannot be scanned. 5- Properly secure information saved in electronic format and retained with physical work papers (e.g., encrypt or password protect electronic files and stored with physical work papers, storing passwords in a separate email or file section). 6- Return, to the entity or individual from whom the information was collected, any excess information that does not need to be kept for documentation purposes. Alternatively, if the information does not need to be retained or returned, destroy any hard copy information and delete any electronic information from all storage devices. 7- Redact or remove pieces of information (e.g., personal information, client names) that identify clients, companies or individuals, where applicable, from sample proposals and deliverables before posting information to internal resources, such as knowledge sharing repositories and websites. For additional information review Tax Data Security, Confidentiality and Your Responsibility and E&amp;C’s Information Protection Principles document for definitions of the above terms.

Liz at one of her book signing events What a difference a year makes. Last year we told you about Liz Sutherland, a senior associate in the Human Resources Shared Services Center (HR SSC) in Tampa, and the impact she’s making on her local community, including the Tampa office, as a product of the foster care system. After receiving an overwhelming response from people at PwC, Liz decided to share her story, and her strength, with an even broader audience by writing a book focused on helping others in the foster care community. “No Ordinary Liz: An Extraordinary Story of Life and Family” was published in May 2018, coinciding with Foster Awareness Month. “The impetus to write the book began with PwC -- they helped me find my purpose,” she said. Overwhelming response The book has since been circulated to foster kids and their families, as well as nonprofits and schools, to positive acclaim. Some readers have shared how the tips Liz offers in the book will help them in their daily lives when dealing with the foster care system. Others have been impressed with Liz’s strong will to not just survive, but thrive, and have thanked her for sharing her knowledge so others could benefit. Coworkers have also weighed in, asking for advice on foster parenting, navigating the adoption process and volunteering at nonprofits and agencies. And, many have expressed appreciation for her openness. “There are times when pouring your heart out is the best option; for me, it’s the only option,” said Liz. The book is also an extension of Liz’s volunteer work as a foster care advocate. “I represent foster children within the legal system because they need a voice,” she said. “They need to be represented by someone who has their best interests at heart.” The sky’s the limit With her authentic voice, Liz is certainly making an impact. She looks forward to the journey ahead and continuing to share her passion and insight. What’s next? “More collaboration with the school systems, adoption agencies and foster care organizations,” she said. “I want to continue to educate people and help them understand the full picture -- and change the general perception out there.” Go here to learn more about Liz and her book.

It’s easy to get started and usually takes less than 5 minutes to set up -- you choose the type of challenge and who you want to invite through the Well-Being Rewards platform. Choose your challenge There are many types of challenges to choose from. Challenge yourself, or add friends and colleagues. Step it up: Choose from the 1 Day Throwdown, Weekday Step-off or Weekend Rumble to get inspired to take more steps. Small changes can make a big difference: The platform offers a wide variety of challenges to help you make meaningful changes every day. From small behavior change challenges like expressing gratitude and limiting complaints, to financial challenges like saving your change or bringing your lunch, to environmentally friendly challenges like saving energy. You can personalize challenges to help you feel good and focus on behaviors that matter to you. Start your challenge To start your challenge via the desktop app, go to Well-Being Rewards and select “Challenges” from the menu across the top of the page, and then select the “+ Create Challenge” button at the top of the page. Then select the challenge that interests you from the pop-up box. When using the mobile app, select the “Home” tab and then “Challenges” from the menu, and tap on the “Create a Challenge” button at the bottom of the page. Earn points and rewards Challenges can help you earn lots of points: Create a personal challenge -- earn 50 points Add five PwC colleagues as friends -- earn 250 points Join a challenge -- earn 100 points Post a chat comment at least once a week for all weeks of the challenge -- earn 100 points Track steps at least once a week for all weeks of the challenge – earn 100 points (for activity/steps challenges only) You can earn up to $500 in rewards each plan year (July 1-June 30) through the Well-Being Rewards Program. You accumulate points toward four program levels each quarter for activities like tracking healthy habits, challenges, reviewing daily cards, financial to-dos and tracking steps. When you accumulate enough points to reach each level during the quarter, you earn the PulseCash associated with that level. For example, when you earn 2,000 points, you earn $10 PulseCash for achieving level one. Then, when you earn 3,000 more points (for a total of 5,000 points during the quarter), you earn the PulseCash associated with level two ($20 PulseCash). This applies to levels three and four too. When the quarter is over, your points will reset to zero and you’ll start fresh in the new quarter earning points toward levels and PulseCash rewards; you’ll keep whatever PulseCash you may have earned during the quarter. In addition, you can receive up to an additional $100 per year when you complete additional activities under the program, such as $50 for undergoing a routine preventive exam. PulseCash is considered taxable income at the time it is earned and posted in your Well-Being Rewards account. PulseCash can be redeemed for gift cards, merchandise, donated to charity, or the cash can be deposited to your bank account (via desktop only). Not registered for Well-Being Rewards yet?

That’s why Sakina Abdul Haqq is courageously stepping up to share her personal experience. She knows firsthand both the challenge and value of discussing mental health issues -- and she wants others to know they’re not alone. From the outside, everything in Sakina’s life appeared perfect in 2016. She’d given birth to her first child and transferred from PwC Dallas to Portland, Oregon. But on the inside, Sakina was hurting and didn’t know why. Seeking support “For the first time in my 13-year career with PwC, my performance was declining,” Sakina reflected. “I knew something was wrong but couldn’t explain it. So I decided to see a healthcare professional and discovered a mental health condition was affecting my performance.” Sakina was diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that’s related to changes in season. “Believing mental health was a taboo subject at work, I kept my condition a secret from colleagues,” she said. “Looking back, I wish I had reached out to my peers. Support would’ve made my road to recovery much smoother.” With exercise, meditation, a nutritionist and follow-up doctor visits, Sakina made lifestyle changes to manage stress and prevent future episodes. She credits firm benefits and resources like Live and Work Well, Be well, work well and the Well-Being Rewards Program for assisting in her recovery. Willingness to address mental health More importantly, she commends the firm’s willingness to address mental health. “I’m happy to see we’re creating a culture that encourages our people to talk openly about mental health,” she said. “People need to know that talking about their condition can assist in recovery.” Today, Sakina embraces the firm’s flexibility and takes advantage of resources like the Calm app -- available in PwC’s App Store -- for meditation. She also tracks daily health habits on Virgin Pulse and is working more flexibly with her team. She knows what it takes to Be well, work well and hopes her experience will encourage others to do the same. Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know! Resources to help you improve your mental well-being - Six free mental health visits: Our new LiveWell Resources program (access code: pwc) includes six free mental health visits -- in addition to the mental health coverage in the PwC medical plan -- per person/issue each medical plan year (July 1-June 30).

Acceleration Centers Core Team March 25, 2019 Why are we moving to Phoenix? Phoenix will improve the way we work by creating a centralized way to engage with our Delivery Centers, decreasing back and forth emails for efficiency and providing greater transparency for our interactions. Phoenix will also drive consistency, rendering longer term efficiencies and predictability for business forecasting, and ultimately improving quality. In line with our One Firm/Advisory 2.0 strategy, which includes differentiating how we deliver value to clients, we will continue to streamline processes and provide the ability to leverage our full Delivery Center capabilities on our client projects. What will teams need to do? Starting April 8, teams will use Phoenix to make the initial connection with our Delivery Centers during the pursuit process. Using Phoenix is easy - there is a simple form to fill out, and Phoenix will pull data from Salesforce, avoiding the need for duplicate data entry. But in case you need help, our Delivery Center Solutioning team will provide hands-on support to first time Phoenix users. We look forward to hearing your feedback on how the process goes, so we can continue to make updates to Phoenix in the coming months. This is all part of changing the way we work, resulting in transparency, predictability, and efficiencies.

You already know that it's important to eat right, exercise, take breaks and get a good night’s sleep, but have you considered these tips to help you manage and make the most of each day for yourself and others? Pause. Taking short moments throughout the day can help you find calm in the eye of the storm. Between meetings? Re-set yourself with 60 seconds of focused breathing. This helps you expand and contract your lungs bringing oxygen to your brain, lowering your heart rate and allowing you to feel more calm and regain focus. Feel your stress level rising? Learn some mindfulness techniques and download the Calm app from PwC’s App Store. The app offers guided meditations, sleep stories, breathing programs and relaxing music. And you can enjoy it all … on us (free to PwC partners and staff). Work in sprints. We know it’s a busy time, so please remember to plan for focused work sprints — setting aside a precise period to tackle a task with a clear start and stop time. Close all tabs and windows other than the one you are working directly in, turn off your notifications, and work single-mindedly for at least 25 minutes and no more than 90. You’ll get more work done during this sprint than at any other point in the day. Tackle your most challenging task for the day first thing in the morning when you are the most energized. The key to success is not to look at your email before you start! To channel your energy during a focused work sprint, consider playing focus music from the Calm app and learn more focus techniques on Vantage. Laugh. It's a great antidote for stress, helps build team camaraderie, and studies show it can even make you 10% more productive, so make it an integral part of your day. Start your mornings with a funny video, joke or photo and then share the humor (appropriately). Assign one team member each day to be responsible for infusing some daily fun and enjoyment. Check out this article on the benefits of laughing in the office. Pass it on. Positive energy is literally contagious, so shine the light on yourself and others. Celebrate big and small milestones with your colleagues and recognize them. (Tap into our Appreciation Bank to find alternative ways to appreciate others.) Keep a gratitude journal or incorporate a similar ritual into your daily routine — science tells us that just thinking about positive things helps to rewire our brain to see more of the upside. Extend a random act of kindness to someone — they will be inspired to share it with others! These are just a few techniques to help you renew and be at your best both at home and at work. Learn more via the Habit Bank and our Be well, work well site. And you can add habits to your daily routine through our Well-Being Rewards program in the Virgin Pulse app. Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/30741.html</url><pwc_title>DocuSign is here: Save the trees -- and your time -- with electronic signatures</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:23:20</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>news-type:Firmwide|source:One Firm Risk Organization</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-07-12 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:One Firm Risk Organization</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>DocuSign is here: Save the trees -- and your time -- with electronic s DocuSign is here: Save the trees -- and your time -- with electronic signatures One Firm Risk Organization July 12, 2018 Electronic signature technology is now available firmwide through the industry-leading DocuSign platform. Be sure to use our new e-signing platform for your next engagement letter, statement of work, or Assurance management representation letter. Instead of waiting for a physical copy of a letter, or having to download a letter manually and sign it, our clients can now use DocuSign’s cloud-based technology to sign on the go. You can easily sign letters sent through DocuSign on smartphones, tablets or desktop computers. And along with lower costs for the firm and our clients, the chance for errors is also reduced. Along with Create, our automated engagement letter creation system that also launches firmwide today), the shift underscores our firmwide strategy to simplify our internal process as well as become digital in all that we do as we improve the experience for our clients in these key contracting interactions. When and how can I start using DocuSign? DocuSign is now available to all staff for US xLoS engagement letters and Assurance management representation letters. If you’re in Tax, DocuSign is already incorporated into Create for Tax (see guidance for Tax on the Tax Engagement Letters microsite). DocuSign may not be used to sign opinions, or for personal correspondence. Our DocuSign site has all the materials you’ll need to get started, including FAQs, demo videos and quick reference guides. Be sure to review the User Guide resources (for sender, partner and client) before using DocuSign, so you can learn what’s coming next and help guide your client through the easy process. Is DocuSign mobile? You can access the DocuSign website via your PC, iPad and smartphone via our DocuSign site. For Tax users, DocuSign is already incorporated into Create for Tax, and you should refer to guidance on the tax microsite. For the best user experience, we recommend sending documents from a US firm PC using the DocuSign website; we’ve disabled the DocuSign mobile app for US firm-issued devices. Clients can still sign from their desktop or mobile device by clicking on the links in email prompts sent by DocuSign. What else should I tell my clients? Your clients will find signing our letters easier and more manageable using DocuSign (and many of them may already be familiar with the technology). Begin the conversation with them now that DocuSign is becoming the standard procedure for signing across our firm. You can share this 2-pager with clients for an easy overview of using DocuSign. Some clients may still prefer signing on paper, and that’s OK. But if you show them the benefits, speed and ease of DocuSign, they’ll likely want to join in, too. What else should I know (and share) about DocuSign? DocuSign follows industry-leading best practices for securing data and transactions. Each electronic signature is unique, documentable, encrypted and tamper-evident. DocuSign ensures the confidentiality of all transactions and maintains a comprehensive audit trail of signing events. Key benefits include: Speed - Electronic signing &amp; instant sharing reduces wait time Mobility - Sign documents anywhere, from any device Security - Encrypted electronic signing with audit trail Automatic reminders - Signers receive automated reminders Built-in functionality, and connection to other PwC systems, also allows you to: Set the “signing order” for receiving signatures Experience “smart” access to client engagement letters, based according to the document type and partners/staff attached to the client in A&amp;C Customize access with ease, allowing you to grant access to your document to anyone firmwide What’s next? Initially, Assurance and Advisory users will access DocuSign through a direct link, and manually load and tag letters for sending. (DocuSign is already incorporated into Create for Tax.) In a few months, DocuSign will integrate with Create, our new engagement letter creation system. Create makes drafting engagement letters, statements of work and other deliverables simpler, guiding you through questions and pulling in the right firm-approved language.

The scholarship recipients are among the highest-performing of all US high school students as assessed by the prestigious National Merit Scholarship Program for the 2018/2019 school year. This year’s Foundation scholars reflect the rich diversity of PwC people and offer a view into tomorrow’s workforce as they describe career interests ranging from AI and machine learning to biomolecular engineering and dentistry. Take a look: Julia Guo is majoring in computer science at Columbia University, where she developed an interest in machine learning during a summer study program. “I utilized logistic regression modeling and the R programming language to improve New York City's government-led Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise program,” said Julia, daughter of New York Advisory Manager Yunwei Guo. She is grateful for the Foundation scholarship because it lowers the financial burden of college, “lifting a weight off my parents’ shoulders and consequently mine. As first-generation immigrants from China, my parents have had to make endless sacrifices to give me a comfortable life and allow me to pursue my hopes and dreams through attaining a quality education.” Amanda Denning (center) is majoring in chemical engineering at Northwestern University in Chicago. “The scholarship will be a huge help to me in financing my education and ultimately doing what I want to do in life: Make a positive impact in the world by curing diseases,” said Amanda, daughter of Advisory Partner Brad Denning in Philadelphia. “I have a lot of school in front of me, and this scholarship will help me on my journey.” Jingyi Dai plans to study international relations at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. “This scholarship has decreased my financial burden, allowing me to focus on my education rather than its cost," said Jingyi, daughter of Tax Manager Wenjun Dai in Stamford. "By dedicating my time to studies rather than worrying about money, I will have a strong start to my college experience.” Chelsea Carver is majoring in biology at University of Pittsburgh, where she’s also accepted into the Honors Program and the Guaranteed Admissions Program for the School of Dental Medicine. “I chose this career path after becoming fascinated with the various dental procedures I experienced in my childhood," said Chelsea, daughter of Advisory Partner Thomas Carver in Pittsburgh. "I learned firsthand how dentists help improve their patients’ lives and the communities they serve.” Anmol Parande will major in electrical engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley. For Anmol, son of Chicago Advisory Partner Rajendra Parande, the scholarship “inspires me to continue working hard to build greater initiatives in the future.” Akshaya Venkata (in cap and gown) will major in chemical and biomolecular engineering at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. “This financial recognition gives me the morale boost to pursue my dream of finding a cure for cell-based degenerative diseases,” said Akshaya, daughter of IFS Director Venkata Thiagarajan in Tampa.

He recently completed a pro bono project with the San Francisco Police Department that brought our purpose -- to build trust in society and solve important problems -- into focus. Here’s more from Mukund: Tell us about this project and the problem you were trying to solve. The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD), like many around the country, is going through a lot of change as they work to build stronger relationships with the community they serve. They’re grappling with whether they have the right diverse makeup on their force, whether they’re applying the right principles of when to use force, how they are addressing issues of bias and challenges related to homelessness, etc. They went through a Department of Justice audit a year and a half ago, and the findings required some changes in policies and process, including the need for strategic planning, which hadn’t been done in more than 10 years. We were connected with the Department through CivicBridge, a program run jointly by the SF Mayor’s office for public/private partnerships and a PwC alumnus who worked in the Mayor’s office. It was a quick project -- three months for “Strategy 1.0” that would identify their strategic priorities for the next three to five years. PwC’s purpose was a part of our conversations from the beginning, as at its core, the problem SFPD is trying to solve is the need to build trust with its constituents while continuing to keep the city safe, at a time when police-community relations are becoming more and more strained. What about your work brings you a sense of fulfillment/pride? This project put all the things I love about being a consultant front and center. I do a lot of strategic planning, but this was different: sitting in focus groups with cops, and hearing about the types of problems they’re facing, was very real. I’ve never worked on something that impacted my own life so directly -- I live in San Francisco, as does much of the team, so doing something that directly makes my own community better was very different for me. The SFPD now has what they need to move forward and think through long-term strategy. Hopefully, everyone in San Francisco will see the benefit of that. What role does trust play in your relationships? As consultants, we come to listen, with no agenda. We establish trust by virtue of being neutral outsiders. Even though the core PwC team had no law enforcement background, the SFPD trusted us to help think through what they need and what their stakeholders are expecting of them. Our project governance structure also included an outside stakeholder group (members of the community), which was much more skeptical, so we worked hard to understand their perspective and, over time, built trust and allowed them to open up to the team with their concerns and priorities. We also relied on internal resources (e.g., PwC’s Safe and Smart Cities Initiative), as well a significant amount of external research, to bring an outside-in point of view. What aspects of your role do you enjoy most? Problem solving, for sure. I’m grateful for the kind of reach we have as a firm to get involved in these types of rare opportunities. Consulting as a model gives you the setup and PwC has the brand -- people want to hear from us on how to best approach their problems and that gives us access. It shows the level of trust people place in us and allows us to have greater, more meaningful impact. The PwC team who worked on this engagement included Igor Belokrinitsky, Kristin Centanni, Kristin Craig, Sierra Hawthorne, Elaine Liu, Keith Lucken, Ken Lund, Kendall McCarthy, Richa Mohan, Helen Petersen, Mukund Srirangapatnam and Martin Wan.

Penalty assessments can be costly. Know Filing a tax return extension? Penalty assessments can be costly. Know the deadlines One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 31, 2019 With tax filing season upon us, it remains important that engagement team members are aware of the changes in due dates for certain tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015 and how those due dates impact our clients. It is also important that we collaborate with our clients regarding the importance of obtaining timely extensions and filing their tax returns on time. This communication is being issued as part of an ongoing effort to remind engagement teams of the revised due dates for certain tax returns, now entering into the third filing season for which such due dates are applicable, and the steps you can take with clients to reduce the instances of penalties for late-filed returns, missed extension requests, etc. Clients may not be aware of the penalties for failure to file timely returns, or understand the time involved or the challenges associated with obtaining timely extensions. Clients also may not appreciate that penalty abatement is not automatic. Based on recent experience, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain abatement of penalties. To avoid the unpleasant, and potentially costly, surprise of a penalty notice, engagement teams should discuss with clients the importance of establishing clear responsibilities for obtaining timely extensions and, if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions, ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting the responsibilities with your clients before extensions are due is an important part of managing this important aspect of engagement execution. For additional information regarding changes in due dates, click here. PwC’s Tax Controversy and Regulatory Services (TCRS) group and OFRO Tax have published the guidance below regarding the importance of extensions and related best practices. Please read the guidance and continue to collaborate with your clients around this important aspect of our client service. If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact a member of TCRS or OFRO Tax. Thank you for your efforts in serving clients and representing the firm. * * * * * * OFRO Tax and PwC’s TCRS group continue to assist engagement teams with requests for abatement of penalties assessed on late-filed returns. While most extensions are timely e-filed or paper-filed, TCRS is seeing penalties assessed in part because: When preparing to e-file an extension, the person responsible for ascertaining that the extension is accepted by the IRS mistakenly believes the extension has been e-filed when, in fact, the final act of “sending” or “transmitting” the extension never took place (e.g., “pushing the button” did not take place) or the IRS did not accept the extension. Roles are not effectively communicated when PwC e-files some extensions and prepares a paper copy of other extensions for filing by the client. The client believes PwC has e-filed an extension when, in fact, PwC has sent a paper extension to the client for mailing to the taxing authority. When filing a paper extension by mail, the person submitting the extension believes that it is timely mailed by generating a mailing label using “SimpleCertifiedMail” or by merely dropping it off in the mail room, when extra steps should be taken to ensure it is processed timely to the U.S. Post Office so there is no risk that the extension would not be considered timely. For both new and existing clients, the party responsible for e-filing or paper filing the extension is not clearly identified before the due date for filing the extension. Lack of awareness regarding new due dates for certain tax returns. Recommendations Engagement teams should collaborate with our clients regarding extensions as part of the engagement process. Those discussions should include the importance of obtaining timely extensions and, if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions, engagement teams should ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting in writing the responsibilities with your clients before the due date for filing the extension is an important aspect of such client collaboration. To avoid the unpleasant surprise of an IRS penalty notice, clients and PwC engagement teams should make a concerted effort to discuss the following before the due date for filing the extension: Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for preparing the extension (does the engagement letter with the client discuss responsibility for preparing and submitting the extension?); Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for e-filing or paper filing the extension; Who at the client or at PwC will obtain proof of timely filing of the extension (g., an electronic confirmation from the IRS that the extension was accepted; a copy of the U.S. Certified Mail – return receipt form; or a tracking number from one of the private delivery services listed in IRS Notice 2016-30); and Who at the client or at PwC should provide proof to the other party of timely filing of the extension prior to the original due date? This step of providing proof of the filing of the various extensions prior to the original due date can be an essential step in helping to ensure that all extensions have been properly filed – like other aspects of engagement execution this process should have four-eyes review and appropriate partner involvement. No extension request should be considered as having been filed until proof of filing is obtained. The reviewer on the engagement should ensure that proof of filing on, or preferably before, the statutory deadline for timely filing an extension request (i.e., original due date of return) has been saved in the DMS tax file. Best Practice Suggestions Review the revised statutory due dates for certain tax returns. In light of changes to the due dates for certain tax returns, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015, familiarize yourself with the new due dates as they will impact the time period for requesting extensions. For additional information on the new due dates, click here. To the extent you have any questions about the new dates, please consult with a member of the TCRS group (for federal tax matters) or a SALT SMS (for state and local tax matters). Review the e-Filing Procedures With Your Team. We have heard from a number of engagement teams that, after receiving the extension communication in prior years, team members met to review the steps required for e-filing extension requests, and the procedures for confirming that the taxing authority accepts extension requests. We encourage you to consider discussing extensions and e-file procedures with your team members in an effort to mitigate the risk of missed extensions. Review the Extension Form. Review the extension form to ensure that all required information is included in the extension and that all questions and boxes have been appropriately addressed. Proof That an Extension Has Been Successfully e-Filed. After electronically transmitting the extension to the IRS or state tax agency, you should receive an acknowledgement showing the status of the extension. Typically, the software used to e-file an extension generates an “acceptance” receipt from the IRS. A receipt that contains the status as “Accepted” is proof that the IRS accepted the form. If the receipt contains the status as “Acknowledged,” it is not proof that the IRS accepted the form. Similarly, a spreadsheet that aggregates information on multiple extensions for a particular client is not proof that the IRS accepted a particular extension form. Please discuss with your compliance team the procedures to obtain verification that the electronic transmittal of the extension was “Accepted” and the timing for performance of these procedures. There is a similar process with those state revenue departments that require or permit e-filing. Proof That a Paper Extension Has Been Mailed Timely. In some cases, PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and is authorized by the client to mail the extension to the IRS or state tax agency on behalf of the client. Familiarize yourself with the mailroom’s delivery times. Where possible, time sensitive filings should be delivered directly to the U.S. Post Office main window so that proof of acceptance by the U.S. Post Office (e.g., Certified Mail receipt stamped by the U.S. Post Office) is obtained. If you are using SimpleCertifiedMail to create mailing labels, there is a risk that the non-USPS receipt may not be sufficient to establish timely filing. In order to avoid any risk, you should ensure that you have an acceptance scan from the U.S. Post Office on that same date. Although recent case law has allowed the use of a non-USPS receipt date to govern timely filing, there is still an added risk and the above guidelines should be followed. File an Extension Even If No Tax Due for Year. A tax return that reports a net operating loss, or no tax liability, can still lead to significant penalties being assessed if the return is not timely filed (e.g., returns filed late with Forms 5471, 5472, 8865, etc. attached). File an extension even if the return is expected to report no tax liability for the year. File Extensions Early. An extension can be filed any time after the end of the tax year and before the original due date of the return for that year. A calendar year taxpayer may file an extension as early as January 1 of the following year. An extension may be filed without a payment, so long as the tax liability for the year is stated on the extension correctly. A corporate taxpayer’s reasonably estimated tax liability, however, must be paid on or before the due date of the return, excluding extensions. When in Doubt, Call the IRS. The IRS does not notify taxpayers that an extension request has not been filed. If you are unsure of whether an extension is on file with the IRS, you may contact the IRS practitioner priority line at (866) 860-4259. You must have a Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, ready to fax to the IRS if your authorization is not already on file with the IRS. Due Date Has Passed and No Extension Was Filed. If the due date for filing the extension has passed, please consult with TCRS immediately. In the event that an extension was missed, a return was filed late, or penalties were assessed for the late filing of a return, please consult with TCRS and a Regional OFRO Tax Partner in accordance with our policy on Troublesome Practice Matters. Additional Discussion In various situations, our clients believe they, or PwC, filed a timely: Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns; Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return; or Form 8868, Application for Extension of Time To File an Exempt Organization Return. A client may have PwC assist with filing an extension in several ways, including: PwC is engaged to e-file the extension with the IRS on behalf of the client; PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension, and then mails the extension to the client for the client to file with the IRS; PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and mails the extension to the IRS on behalf of the client. If the IRS determines that the return is untimely because there is no extension on file with the IRS, penalties may be assessed under IRC sections 6651(a)(1) and 6651(a)(2) for failure to file a timely return and failure to pay tax timely. However, the largest penalty assessments TCRS is seeing are for late international information returns. Under an automated program, the IRS assesses: a $10,000 civil penalty for each late filed Form 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect To Certain Foreign Corporations; and a $25,000 civil penalty for each late filed Form 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business. Upon examination, the IRS may also assert additional delinquency penalties associated with other international information returns (e.g., Forms 8865, 8858, 926) that are not filed timely. States may impose similar penalties. These penalties are assessed whether or not the taxpayer has an income tax liability associated with the tax return. Additionally, late-filed original returns also may jeopardize the validity of tax elections that must be made on a timely filed original return.

Lab notes: Automate your Mobile Time — bot seriously! HQ News Jan. 28, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Time entry is tedious and time-consuming -- but also an important part of how we run our business. Thanks to Digital Lab, you can now enter your time in seconds. Tuan Nguyen, from the Automation Center of Excellence team, and others have developed a bot to eliminate the daily search for WBS codes and descriptions, saving time and stress around this everyday compliance. We talked to Tuan to learn more about the Mobile Time Entry bot. PwC Inside: How did you come up with the idea for the Mobile Time Entry bot? Tuan: I wasn’t familiar with technology like UiPath before I joined the firm. It was a hobby at first, since in compliance-heavy accounting, you never thought you could use bots. But now, being on the robotics team, I see what a great opportunity we have to be on the cutting edge. Entering time is a pain point. There are so many codes and it can take upwards of a half-hour of non-chargeable time per day. So, when UiPath came out, the Innovation team knew this was something we wanted to use bots to solve for. And now, even if you are only saving five minutes a day for one person, that’s 80,000 hours a year across the firm. What has the feedback been? We’ve already iterated several versions, based on feedback. The first version was based on code descriptions and took a while initially to set up, so we worked with others to build up the capabilities. You no longer have to enter in names and other fields -- you only need the code, and the bot will automatically pull in the other info. We also created a tutorial demo video, to provide foolproof instructions for getting started. And based on feedback from our colleagues in Mexico, we created a separate version for their time. Were there challenges? Even though entering time is a common task across the firm, we realized through Digital Lab that everyone completes their time differently. Some people have long lists of codes, some only have one or two; some people have to use descriptions, some have more specific codes to include as identifiers. After collecting feedback for all of these scenarios we had to solve for, we made improvements. But the personal challenge has been taking constructive criticism well. Automations become your baby. You get protective of changing them, but you always have to keep the end user in mind. If they aren’t happy using it, why did you make it? So, I value the one- or two-star ratings more than the five-star. Have you submitted anything else to Digital Lab? I am co-author on several submissions. I help teams with the initial process map and proof of concept while they get upskilled, and then they take on testing and making updates, which is really rewarding. Do you know how you will use your Digital Lab rewards? Anytime I get Real-time recognition or other rewards, it goes straight to my wife. So I guess it depends on what she wants.

While most of us can only yell at the screen, a few PwCers know what it’s like to experience the game as a player. Jordan Bond, Kyle Doughterty and Gabe Knutson played for the University of Louisville men's team, Villanova University women's team and Lehigh University men's team, respectively, and each made it to the NCAA tournament. Besides picking up expert dribbling and shooting skills, they all also say that playing competitive college sports has helped them develop skills that we all need to be successful. Time management Kyle, a senior associate, says the time management skills she picked up while balancing academics and athletics in college are incredibly helpful at work. “It’s important to have set times to focus on different things and to be able to transition between different activities,” she said. Gabe, also a senior associate, added that it’s crucial to “develop a balancing system that works for you.” What might work for one person will not necessarily work for someone else. Responding to feedback Jordan, an experienced associate, says being coachable has been helpful in his career. “Every day on the job I’ve found that I’m being coached. You kind of have to be a sponge and be receptive. You have to understand that you don’t know everything and can always learn more.” Teamwork and collaboration Teamwork and collaboration are critical on and off the court. Jordan points out that “you have to recognize everyone’s strengths and weaknesses and see where you can add value.” Part of this teamwork is self awareness, shares Kyle. She says it’s important to “know what you bring to the table and what you’re good and not so good at. The things you’re good at, you should take the initiative and lead, and learn from others regardless of what level they are.” Gabe, Kyle and Jordan have continued playing basketball since joining PwC — they’ve each been a part of the US team in the annual PwC international basketball tournament and have played on different recreational teams. As for their brackets, Gabe and Jordan are both rooting for Michigan State on the men’s side. Kyle is hoping the University of Connecticut wins the women’s trophy.

As more and more gets built into the tool, its performance has taken a hit and has not consistently operated at the level that we expect of a tool that is so critical to the management of our business. We understand the frustration from a user experience perspective, particularly for those of you who are budgeting and managing large, complex projects and we are working diligently to identify the root cause of these issues and resolve them as quickly as possible. Multiple fixes have been released over the past two weeks, so you should already be seeing improvements. A maintenance period will now be in place every night between 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. ET to help stabilize the system during the day. This is temporary, and we will continue to release additional updates as remaining issues are resolved. We ask for your patience as we get Flex operating again like the exceptional tool that it is. In the meantime, please reach out to your Tax PM Drivers with any questions or concerns.

The hubs structure and guide Advisory professionals’ development at their staff level. x-Advisory Development Hubs are currently available for associates and managers. Hubs for senior associates and directors will be available in January 2019. The x-Advisory Development Hub for Associates helps associates understand our business, expand their networks, develop the core consulting skills necessary for success and deepen their technical knowhow -- all building blocks to help establish them as PwC professionals. The x-Advisory Development Hub for Managers provides an easy place to find the critical information and helpful resources managers need to be successful. It has been ordered so that each section builds on the one before it, so it’s recommended that managers navigate the content in sequential order. (For managers who have attended, or are currently attending, the xLoS Leadership Pathways program for managers, the Advisory technical curriculum you receive is the same as the customized curriculum you will find in the hub. Whether you complete the training through the hub or Leadership Pathways, your completion will be recorded in both curriculums. ) Senior associates and directors, be on the lookout for information about your x-Advisory Development Hubs coming soon.

Yet this experience remains invisible to many of us. To help shed light on this dimension of diversity and learn ways we can all become allies for disability inclusion, our Professionals With Disabilities Network is hosting a panel discussion webcast Oct. 16 at 1 p.m. ET (Add to calendar). Moderated by Diversity and Inclusion Managing Director Jennifer Allyn, the discussion will include panelists Rob Rusch, Tax manager; Milan Shah, Assurance partner; and Julia Taylor Kennedy, co-author of the Center for Talent Innovation “Disabilities and Inclusion” research report. We believe bringing together people with diverse perspectives — including individuals with disabilities — is a business imperative to spur innovation, drive growth and help us solve important problems in new and creative ways. This commitment to building an inclusive team is part of the reason we’ve been recognized for our efforts by the National Organization on Disability as a Leading Disability Employer.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Update: Since this writing, Ed has worked with the Creative team to update the Digital Story site, and helped raise awareness of new Digital Lab features through live events in several offices. The team also provided eye-catching visuals to help us celebrate our New Partners and Promotion Day earlier this summer, and are working on FY20 Strategy priorities. Look for their award-winning visuals and videos on your devices and in the offices — and take another look at Ed’s interesting story! Name, rank, serial number? I'm Ed Trenn, a senior manager on the US Creative Team, based out of Washington, D.C. I’ve been with the firm for almost 27 years. What's a typical day for you? I work closely with our Marketing &amp; Sales, Internal Communications &amp; Change and External Communications teams on everything from videos to web pages to multimedia ad campaigns. As an account manager, I help them plan for every communication channel and suggest ways to achieve a “wow” factor. It’s very rewarding; they share their vision with me, then I get together with my colleagues on the Creative Team to figure out how to bring it to life! How did your journey lead you to this role? It’s certainly been an evolution! I was only the second graphic designer hired in the Washington, D.C., office. This was back before email and direct deposit! I designed printed proposals and oral presentations with 35mm slides, but got exposure to the internet and computer graphics when those were in their infancies. Within a few years, I moved to the group that later became Advisory and then to Brand as a project manager helping designers with content development. And now, account management for the US Creative Team. How does your team bring value to PwC? We listen to our customers. A good example of this is when we design the artwork and graphics for Promotion Day for all markets. We realize that every market differs in size and scope, and we dedicate ourselves to making sure there's proper scalability -- so every office feels like they are directly connected to the campaign. Making our clients happy is key; creating this year's emoji campaign brought a lot of smiles to a festive occasion! Overall, we're constantly learning and using new technologies and techniques for a wide variety of channels -- whether in a PwC office or at a sports arena. A good example of this is our Digital Story, which uses animation and web content to bring our journey to life. What might we be surprised to learn about you? I know American Sign Language. A deaf friend of mine moved to Washington, D.C., from Italy and needed help with his English while working on his Ph.D. I learned how to sign to better communicate with him. He's repaid my help with the use of his condo near Rome! Travel goes hand-in-hand with my love of old cars, too. I buy them, fix them up and go to car shows with my car club. So far we’ve been to events and museums in England, Holland and throughout the US. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story!

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Julie Huske, a director in the Chief Data Office. I’m based in Chicago and have been with the firm for eight years. What's a typical day for you? I lead a team that brings new technology to PwC and teaches our people how to use it. We drive innovation across the firm in data analytics and automation. We built the strategy and Digital Academy training programs that teach our people how to use today’s hottest tools to help their clients -- whether internal or external. You’ll often find me researching new tools, facilitating training sessions or connecting dots so those people we’ve trained can help train others. How did your journey lead you to this role? I began as a chemical engineer in the pharma industry and later joined PRTM as a consultant. Much to my surprise, PwC acquired PRTM in 2011! My team sits in the Chief Data Office, where we focus on connecting our people -- IFS and client service -- with their data through the use of tools like Alteryx, Tableau, PowerBI, UiPath, Digital Lab and DataRobot. My love for data allowed me to pilot the Data Analytics Academies and Data Ninja programs that are now being scaled through the Your Tomorrow Digital Academies, where we’re upskilling tech learning for anyone in the firm. I love making our people’s lives easier through innovative tools! How does your team bring value to PwC? We’re committed to helping PwC staff enhance their technical acumen so they can better navigate the new data-driven future, leveraging tools like Digital Hub for more resources and Digital Lab for ready-built applications. We help our people learn things like how to tell a story with data and how to make processes run more smoothly and save time. Teaching anyone who’s game to learn truly brings us joy -- and we stay connected with them as they continue along their knowledge journey. What role does teaming play in your success? We’re very supportive of one another, inside and outside the office. And we have a lot more in common than our mutual love for data! Everyone on our team has children -- one of us is even a grandmother. Our solid network empowers us to be leaders in what we do. We find ways to get the work done as a team, whether virtually or in person. Since we’re often traveling separately and working remotely, we use the Academies as a chance to connect in person to maximize the time we have together. I’m also a firm believer in having fun at work -- and our team certainly does! Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story!

Tampa-based IT Director Sean Boyette has been with PwC for 20 years -- and with the military, as a National Guardsman, for 26. He describes himself as having a dual dedication to both PwC and the military. "It's like having parallel careers; they really complement each other," he said. Sean's also one of only a few to achieve Lt. Colonel in the National Guard in the state of Florida. A born leader, he's overseen numerous military initiatives as well as IT teams here at PwC. He's found a way to blend the two distinct career paths by staying active in the firm's Veterans Affinity Network (VAN). "My interest in VAN began during one of my deployments," he explained. "The firm's VAN members sent care packages to my unit; I was very impressed." Along with his fellow VAN members, Sean supports charitable causes like Run for the Fallen, and places flags and wreaths on tombstones at local federal cemeteries each December for Wreaths Across America. "We look forward to that every year," he said. Sean is also passionate about helping VAN with recruiting. "We figure out how a veteran’s military skills can best converge with PwC,” he said. “And, once they're here, we help them translate their knowledge to a business mindset, in a way that's useful to them and the firm." He's also an advocate for impacting and supporting his local veteran community. "We hold lunches for our Florida VAN members and local veterans. It's a great way to reconnect, reminisce and meet new members." From Lt. Colonel to Colonel On August 3, members of VAN, along with his wife and three children, will be on hand to support Sean as he participates in a "Chain of Command" ceremony, an important step before promotion to Colonel. "I am fortunate,” he said. “I couldn’t have done it without the support of my PwC colleagues.” After Colonel he aspires to be promoted to General. To do that -- and there are only five Generals in the state of Florida -- he needs to achieve a certain level of education for a certification of eligibility; he's currently taking classes to reach that next goal. "At PwC, it's possible to have a parallel career if you are in the military, thanks to the firm's flexibility,” said Sean. “Not every organization offers such support. I appreciate the overwhelming encouragement I received from the moment I came here; I’m proud to serve my country and support PwC." Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

The SMART solution PwC’s SMART® increases the efficiency and effectiveness of inpatient and outpatient coding quality evaluation processes and ensures quality and compliance review. With 25+ years in the market, including clients like Ascension, Banner, and Northwell, SMART is built on decades of coding and billing process work resulting in the most extensive business rules in the market. The SMART difference SMART benefits 35% Avg. cases flagged for review 100% Cases evaluated 8-12% Diagnosis-related group (DRG) change rate $2000 Avg. net impact per case SMART was a critical component of process redesign that directly contributed to improving our Health Systems Healthgrades scores. By utilizing daily focused coding assessments and education, we also enhanced our overall coding and documentation practices.

Without a free lunch program, they may not have enough food; without a school building, they may not have a safe place to go; without a teacher’s guidance, they may not stay engaged in learning. The long break can lead to what’s known to educators as “summer brain drain.” This can most negatively impact students from underserved communities, who may not have access to additional help (tutors, after school programs, etc.) to catch up come September. According to the National Summer Learning Association, when the school year ends, children in high-poverty environments struggle not only with basic needs, but also with losing precious time during the summer months to continue their learning. The cumulative effect is a crisis in the making: By the fifth grade, summer learning loss can leave low-income students almost three years behind their peers. These are the kids we’re committed to supporting through Access Your Potential. So this summer, we’re making sure that fun and learning aren’t mutually exclusive by bringing our tech and money curriculum to where students will already be spending their summers. In Los Angeles, AYP volunteers are are working on an eight-week summer camp run by Girls, Inc., a nonprofit organization that supports, mentors and guides girls in an affirming, pro-girl environment. Partners and staff will have the opportunity to share their skills by facilitating our Access Your Potential curriculum as part of the camp’s focus on financial literacy, STEM and technology. In New York, they are setting up custom events with DREAM, a nonprofit that provides inner-city youth with opportunities to play, learn and grow using the power of teams. Students spend the mornings learning in a classroom, and afternoons are spent on the softball/baseball field, learning about teamwork and leadership. In Hartford, they brought in two local middle school robotics teams to the office to work with our PwCers to assemble small robots, gaining pieces of the robots by answering a series of math and critical thinking questions. When the robots were completed, the students took them back to their schools to share the robotics experience with other students in their schools. These are just a few examples of what’s going on around the country. Visit Impact Space to find an opportunity near you.

The move to Aura Online will provide many benefits, including a new team dashboard, integration with other Assurance tools, and the elimination of replication functionality that will cease to be supported by the vendor in 2020 and which has presented challenges and pain points. It’s one more step forward on our Your Tomorrow journey to digitally enable our practice and enhance your experience as practitioners. The next major release of Aura is expected in spring 2019, at which time all Aura functionality will be available in Aura Online. Local Aura replicas and the Navigator are planned to be sunset no later than spring 2020. What can you expect in the transition? Here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions. Why is Aura moving to an online platform? The vendor for replication services will cease support in mid 2020 which is in keeping with the industry shift to web-based solutions, in other words change is not optional. In a similar vein, all existing custom PwC Assurance tools, and those currently in development, are only available in an online platform. This on-line architecture also enables more rapid tool enhancements including continued investment in integrating with our other Assurance applications to drive greater efficiencies. What is the user experience expected to be in Aura Online? Are enhancements planned before the full transition? The core functionality of Aura Online will work very similarly to the existing local version of Aura, and all functionality will be available in Aura Online by spring 2019. In addition, a number of new enhancements are planned, including updates to the user interface, further performance improvements, and new features such as an integrated sampling app to help make sample selection easier. I have limited or no connectivity at the client site and/or travel frequently. How will my team use Aura Online? Good connectivity, specifically access to high-speed internet, is critical for having the best possible experience using Aura Online. Therefore, the Aura Implementation and US IT teams are working to identify and assist teams that have historically had limited network connectivity at client sites to prepare them for the move to online. This effort will continue this fall and through spring/summer 2019. If you know your team has or will have limited connectivity at a client site (or a situation where the client does not provide any network access) and your team has not yet heard from the US implementation team, please fill out this form and an implementation resource will reach out to you. Engaging with clients to implement remediation is often necessary, so getting started early is desirable. I travel frequently. Will I be able to work offline? Aura Offline will provide some offline capabilities, allowing you to check out (download) a number of EGAs and Document Library items for editing and review while disconnected from the PwC network. You will be able to use Aura Offline for example when traveling or commuting when getting connected is not possible or is subpar, or in situations where you have limited connectivity at the client site. However, we expect you will work online most of the time, and only work in Aura Offline for short periods when connectivity is not available. What can I be doing now to plan for this move? Review the full FAQs document for detailed information about the transition. Familiarise yourself with Aura Online and Aura Mobile with this video. Begin discussing these changes with your teams to raise awareness and identify concerns. Identify members of your team who are already using or can begin using Aura Online to complete their audits in order to gather feedback on the overall experience, as well as opportunities for improvement or best practices you’d like to share (click here to provide any feedback). Stay tuned for more to come in the spring of 2019.

Do you understand the Pricing Structures and Pricing Enablers that can further differentiate PwC in the market? And do you know how to bring our Smart Pricing strategy to life for your teams? We’ve made tremendous progress towards our Your Tomorrow - Project 5 Million goals, and it’s all thanks to your dedication to transforming how we deliver work, support our people and articulate our value in the market.

To assist teams on the journey, we’re laser-focused on providing the support and resources needed to successfully execute the strategy. To assist teams on the journey, we’re laser-focused on providing the support and resources needed to successfully execute the strategy. In this regard, we’ve expanded Smart Pricing xLoS to enable greater One Firm collaboration, released a One Firm Smart Pricing Tool to simplify the end-to-end pricing process, and launched the Smart Pricing Tax microsite for all managers and above. Our dedicated Tax section of the microsite features valuable resources for taking the next step on our Smart Pricing journey -- no matter where you stand right now. This site is also available as an app in PwC’s App Store. What you’ll find In addition to a wealth of One Firm Smart Pricing content, managers and above can access a variety of Tax-specific resources, customized to our business and the solutions we deliver, including the following: - Pricing with Purpose and FeeTV: Say goodbye to the email newsletters from last year.

Want a consultation for your engagement? Schedule a Help Desk call to speak with a pricing specialist today. How to use the Smart Pricing microsite (hint: remember to Pause, Reflect and Plan)… Our P5M and Smart Pricing strategies are deeply intertwined. As you consider how to digitize your engagement to drive greater value for your clients, we ask that you pause, reflect and thoughtfully plan your pricing approach. When we take the time to identify and communicate the value we deliver to our clients (i.e., co-develop an investment thesis), we can more effectively price in the context of the outcomes we deliver -- rather than rates and hours. In doing so, we will sustain the investments we’re making in our innovation and our people, differentiate PwC in the market, and deliver a deeper Client Experience.

As a firm that is purpose-led and values-driven, we do not tolerate inappropriate conduct at PwC. We already have strong policies and provide training to maintain a respectful workplace at PwC -- and we are committed to doing even more. We’re providing additional training for everyone and at all levels. We just rolled out training specifically for all partners in the US and Mexico. We just released training for supervisory staff in the US (available now on your My Compliance Dashboard). Seniors, managers, senior managers, directors and MDs must complete this training by Thursday, Sept. 6. US Partners will also take this training. For staff in the US below senior associate, information on training will follow this summer. We’re hosting conversations about respect in the workplace in our offices. This is a continuation of our open conversations on difficult issues. In February, the Washington, DC, office hosted our first event, and more than 100 people were part of a candid discussion about appropriate behavior in the workplace. In March, the Houston and Dallas offices, as well as our firmwide Forensics practice, engaged more than 600 partners and staff in three separate conversations. Based on the engagement and positive feedback, we’ll be hosting additional discussions in offices across the firm over the next year. We will keep you apprised of these sessions in PwC Inside and through your local market leaders. We’re unveiling “Candid Conversations: Respect in the Workplace” podcasts. Listen in while Jennifer Allyn, our Diversity Strategy Leader, interviews Denis Clarke, our Ethics &amp; Business Conduct Leader, about the #metoo movement and answers some questions we all have about how we handle these issues at PwC. Team, these trainings and brave conversations will help all of us recognize those moments when we need to take action and live our values. It comes down to each of us treating others with respect -- and each one of us understanding that if we see a situation that isn’t right, we speak up.

Here’s what you need to know about the updated Physical Inventory Observations policy Assurance Aug. 6, 2018 If you are an Assurance associate (in Core/PCS), it’s likely you are involved in inventory counts. So you’ll want to know that we’re updating our Physical Inventory Observations (PIO) policy for FY19, effective September 4. The new policy provides a consistent and streamlined approach to assigning inventory observations and scheduling PIOs for your engagements -- a more evenly spread out process. In addition, associates will now be able to plan ahead for upcoming inventory assignments and ensure their inventory observation requests are properly sourced. You can check out all of the updates on our PIO Spark Page, but here are some of the key enhancements: How PIO requests are assigned Assignment of responsibilities Weekend inventory reserve process &amp; timing Holiday/Year-End firm shut down inventory reserve process &amp; timing Before September 4, be sure to have your TalentLink schedule up-to-date and EMTs submitted to reflect the timing of work. This will help to provide the Deployment Enablement Team (DET) the ability to better align your availability to a PIO assignment.

Enroll in PwC’s specialization in Coursera: Data Analysis and Presentation Skills: The PwC Approach. The five courses in this specialization include roughly 10 to 15 hours of online learning content taught by PwC professionals. The courses comprise videos, reading and quizzes -- and they’re free for partners and staff. No prior knowledge of data and analytics is required. Upon completion, you’ll know how to use data and analytics to solve important problems and present data to others in engaging ways. You can complete each course at your own pace, taking just one -- or all -- of the five courses in the specialization. Present complex data with ease Prior to becoming a Digital Accelerator, Sylvia Binkley enrolled in the specialization to build her data analytics and presentation skills. “By setting aside time each workday, I was able to complete the specialization in less than six weeks,” Sylvia said. “The course was beneficial because I learned how to present complex data, which is something I wasn’t previously comfortable with.” As a Digital Accelerator, Sylvia has had to put her presentation skills to the test. “I was asked to meet with our local Market Council and explain the work Digital Accelerators have been doing,” she said. “My presentation provided a clear overview to the council and included our ask of them.” Everyone at the firm, regardless of their role, can benefit and discover tremendous value in completing the Coursera specialization. Reach your potential and position yourself to be relevant in a rapidly changing world, by enrolling in Coursera today! For more details, check out the Coursera Q&amp;A page.

PwC's CODE-E debuts in NYC Celebrity sighting! PwC's CODE-E debuts in NYC Responsible Business Leadership Dec. 10, 2018 Last week, our human-sized robot and the newest member of PwC’s Access Your Potential® (AYP) team showcased its talents with students in New York. CODE-E warmed up by hosting middle school students from New Alternatives for Children, one of New York Metro’s long-standing nonprofit collaborators (learn more here), at our 300 Madison office. The bot then inspired elementary and high school students across the city to innovate solutions to problems at their schools. With Access Your Potential, we’re helping bridge the gap between the digital skills that employers need and the shortage of qualified candidates by addressing the underlying causes — such as limited access to technology education, especially in underserved communities. CODE-E brings robots out of the realm of toys and sci-fi movies and into classrooms to show students robotics technology so they can see it, interact with it and ask questions about how it works in real life. To make sure kids’ interactions with CODE-E are meaningful, we’ve worked with educators to develop a special curriculum that prompts student discussions around emerging technology and personal innovation. So far, it’s a hit. Some students are even ready to take CODE-E home: “If I had CODE-E in my house, it would help me with my homework.” Interested in bringing CODE-E to your market to engage with students and clients? Request an appearance here. Find the latest Access Your Potential volunteer opportunities on Impact Space, including events that showcase CODE-E in your local market.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Derek Kaivani, a senior manager on the Client Experience team, based out of Atlanta. I've been with the firm for 20 years. After spending most of my career in client service, I made the switch to IFS last year. What's a typical day for you? I help spread the word about the client experience strategy, what it means and how it relates to all of us in our day-to-day lives -- no matter the LoS, or whether our clients are internal or external. I get to travel the globe to share this vision and help inspire engagement teams to "live" the client experience strategy -- not just talk the talk, but walk the walk. How did your journey lead you to this role? I joined the firm as a strategy consultant in Advisory, and later moved to internal audit where I helped rebuild and expand Advisory's operational services capabilities, including the internal audit framework. What followed was Project Edison, a firm initiative focused on delivering a more distinctive experience to our Assurance clients. I was able to see firsthand a significant shift in the firm's client experience strategy. A natural next step led to joining the PwC Experience team, which later became the Client Experience team, where I've been ever since. How does your team bring value to PwC? We want everyone to be as excited as we are about recognizing and achieving successful client experiences! We provide actionable ways to exceed client expectations, not only through the value of what we do, but in how we do it. We help our people strive to be more client-centric across the board. And by generating insights from customer analytics, we can also help our leaders drive loyalty and make customer-driven decisions. What might we be surprised to learn about you? As a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, I’m a four-time Pan-American champion and a Brazilian Nationals champion. My passion for helping others goes hand-in-hand with my love for this sport. I enjoy working with athletes of every level. There’s a lot of joy in teaching -- especially when I work with children and witness the power the sport has to transform their lives. I'm in awe of how it can improve not only their fitness level, but their overall self-confidence as well. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way?

Global Citizen hosts festivals with world leaders, business leaders, world renowned musicians and humanitarians to promote social action and engagement. Since 2011, millions of Global Citizens have taken over 19M actions that have helped raise $37.9 billion to date in commitments, set to affect over 2.25 billion lives. Key areas of focus include education, gender equality and diversity &amp; inclusion. PwC has been proudly supporting Global Citizen on a pro-bono basis since 2017. Our PwC team have defined Global Citizen’s Digital Accountability Strategy and automated the management and tracking of government and commerce commitments. PwC has also provided on ground support at Global Citizen Festivals around the world (Mumbai, New York and Hamburg) that have coincided with meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and G20. Last weekend, some of the PwC Global Citizen team supported the Global Citizen Festival in New York Central Park; over 2.1 million actions led to commitments over $7.75 billion, set to affect the lives of 254 million people.

As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors and IFS directors with five or more years of service are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to unwind, recharge and truly focus on their well-being through Be well, work well -- a key component of Your Tomorrow. San Diego-based Director Scott Dudzik always imagined his career milestone sabbatical would be spent playing golf or vacationing around the world with his wife. All that changed, though, when she announced they were pregnant with their first child. “Fatherhood changed my perspective on life,” Scott admits. “Finding a healthy balance between work and family became a priority. In the past, I took things like our firm’s flexibility for granted. Now I recognize the priceless value of working at a firm that supports its people in finding that balance.” Scott knew he would be able to take advantage of our eight weeks of parental leave. But to maximize his time with his family, Scott considered combining the leave with his sabbatical. “My client schedule doesn’t have a quiet period, given multiple off year-end audits,” Scott says. “So I wasn’t sure how my leadership teams would view my proposal for an extended leave, or if they would support it. Nonetheless, I thought it was worth having the conversation and am glad I did.” Scott’s partners and colleagues supported his request. Based on schedules, they decided it would be best to take the 13-week leave beginning in October, after his client filed at their year-end. The timing worked out beautifully for Scott’s family. “Baby Connor arrived on July 22,” Scott says. “My wife was able to spend her maternity leave with him and when it was time for her to go back to work, I stepped in.” Scott was able to build a special bond with his son and watch him develop. Scott cherishes the memory of his uninterrupted leave and is grateful for his team’s support. “Everyone was very respectful of my time away from work. I encourage others to communicate their needs or requests (such as asking for flexibility or protected time) with their teams. Don’t be afraid to ask. You’ll find people are understanding of what’s important to you and willing to support you.” Visit our Rewards Strategy site to learn more about sabbaticals and PwC's Career Milestone program.

Client problem Health Care Services Corporation (HCSC), a not-for-profit health insurance company, aimed to develop an industry-leading customer engagement platform to help improve member cost of care, health outcomes, and member experience. They wanted to empower customer advocates with critical member information such as care gaps and medical history, that would ultimately allow HCSC to not just compete in, but lead the new market of advocacy-driven solutions. We put the customer at the center of everything—and that’s how we stood out. We created a Magic Moment... Improving the lives of real people is core to what HCSC values, and that’s what inspired our change efforts. We put the customer center-stage and spotlighted every touchpoint area around them. Where were the critical care moments? How could we support those moments in the most standout of ways while meeting business needs and tying in the underlying technology seamlessly? We worked side by side with HCSC leaders at our Experience Center to re-imagine the care journey itself. We showed the client how they could save $600 million through our approach. The solution and value we brought Through BXT, we deployed our Strategy/Enterprise Resilience Integrated Solution, leading to an evolved operating model that upskilled and organized agents. Rather than simply replacing a desktop application, the new approach merges fragmented products and experiences across the enterprise. Customers will have greater access to self-service digital tools and high quality care, supported by increasingly personalized information. The new strategy will improve the health care experience for ~1.5M people in 2019 and 14M+ people by 2021, with over $600M projected total cost savings of the program.

This was originally scheduled to occur on May 25, but a few additional teams surfaced their need to be put on the exception list to ensure their compliance with client engagements outside of the US. For most partners and staff, you’ll be able to work entirely in Google. However, some types of emails may still be delivered to your Notes inbox. If this happens, you’ll receive a notification in your Google mailbox to alert you to any messages that are not forwarded. This may include: Mail from some exception clients and PwC China/Hong Kong PwC systems that rely on Notes applications Notes email messages that are over 25MB or encrypted. Answers to your burning questions ... I’ve been using Notes for years. What resources are available to learn about working in Google? A wealth of resources is available. Here are a few of our top recommendations to learn more: Ask Google. Just click on theicon in Google Mail to search for answers. (Hint: Search for “Gmail Essential Overview” for a great introduction.) Check out the Google@PwC Spark site. It’s filled with tips and tricks for using Google. There’s also a network of users to ask questions and share ideas with. View Connect ’n’ Learn training videos and materials to learn more. Will my Google mail now be filled with more spam? Any mail that you get in your Notes inbox today will be forwarded to Google including your End User Digest from PwCSpamCentre. You can block additional senders by visiting the PwCSpamCentre website (log in with your GUID and GUID Password). Additionally, you can mark an individual email in Google as spam by clicking on the “Report spam” icon in Google Mail. I work with a client on the Global Google Exception Client Registry. What do I need to do? PwC staff working with any client on the Global Google Exception Client Registry will need to continue to use Notes to avoid having information that is required to remain in Notes from being forwarded to Google. Any emails sent to your Notes account from Microsoft and Goldman Sachs will not be forwarded. For users that still have a Notes Calendar, we will not enable mail forwarding for you. I work with client(s) on the exception registry. Should I turn off the Notes Forwarding? Yes. If you work with any clients on the exception registry, you should turn off Notes Forwarding on June 11. I work with PwC China/Hong Kong. What will happen? Any emails from PwC colleagues in China/Hong Kong will be delivered to your Notes inbox. I need to route a specific email via Notes. Is that still possible? Yes. If you need to keep an email in Notes, you may still select "Route via Notes" in the email options. However, that option will need to be selected for every email you want to route via Notes; there is not an option to enable that setting for all Notes email. You should select the “Route via Notes” option when sending email that contains information about a client on the Exception Registry. I use a lot of Mail Rules in Notes, will those still work? Mail Rules in Notes will not transfer to Google; you will need to create mail filters in Google. Information about creating Google email filters is available here. If I send email from my mobile device, what will happen? Update your mobile device mail app settings: go to Settings, then Mail; change your Default Account to PwC Cloud. Google is now your default. You can still select Notes when sending an individual email via mobile, but it will be forced to stay in Notes: when composing an email, tap the From line twice and it will let you select you @us.pwc.com address instead of your @pwc.com address.

Although some apps are convenient to install or are familiar from your personal use, they may not provide the level of security needed to protect firm and client information. WhatsApp, WeChat, personal email and SMS text messaging are not permitted for business use. It is prohibited to conduct business or send communications containing confidential business information through personal emails, SMS text messages or other unauthorized applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram and others that come preinstalled on your device. This includes communications with partners, staff, clients or any other third parties. Additionally, the terms of use for some of these apps conflict with how PwC conducts business. For example, they do not guarantee that conversations or files exchanged are confidential. In addition, chats in these applications may not get erased -- often they are simply hidden and archived in the database of the app. These pose unacceptable information protection risks and are why such apps are not permitted for any business-related purposes. What messaging apps can I use for business? You may use the following secure messaging apps: Google Chat (get the hang of Google Chat) Google Hangouts Notes Sametime (for communicating with non-Google territories) Need help?

In situations where our clients ask us to perform additional Tax services or our services begin to expand (i.e., beyond those we were originally engaged to provide), judgment is required to evaluate whether the additional services represent a substantive change in the nature or scope of services (i.e., “scope creep”) warranting additional approvals. Tax engagement teams should monitor the nature or scope of services provided as their engagements progress, to ensure that the scope does not exceed what was pre-approved by the audit committee (if applicable) and approved by the Responsible Partner listed in Central Entity Service ("CES") through the Authorisation For Services ("AFS") process. Engagement teams should be proactive and discuss additional scope requests with the client and the CES Responsible Partner before performing any additional work. If the nature or scope of services changes or exceeds what has been approved in the original AFS, an additional AFS approval must be obtained from the CES Responsible Partner prior to being engaged to provide or performing the additional services. (Note, when providing certain Tax services, you may also need to obtain AFS approval from a Secondary Independence Reviewer by adding the “US AFSReview” as an Approver on the AFS – see link for more information.) Additionally, you should ensure that the CES Responsible Partner considers whether additional pre-approval by the audit committee is required. Examples of changes in the nature or scope of services requiring an additional AFS (and potentially additional audit committee pre-approval) may include: A change in the nature of the work requested - for example, changing a compliance engagement to include consulting services Changes in the facts and circumstances that may impact the evaluation of threats to independence (including those that impact materiality considerations) Changes in client management that impacts its ability to perform its proper management responsibilities A change such that the service is now being provided to a different affiliate(s) Complying with our independence requirements, including identifying and obtaining the appropriate approvals for “scope creep”, requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. For additional information regarding “scope creep”, see the Independence Policy, Section 4060.12 Scope "Creep". Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

But did you know that lifelong friendships can be formed at Discover? We recently sat down with a group of 2015 alum who developed long-lasting friendships with colleagues they met at Discover. Here’s what some of them had to say. Christopher Houseman Just before my trip to Discover, life was chaotic. Professionally, I was adjusting to a new job title and role at the firm. Personally, I became a father and the primary caretaker of my household. On top of that, I was studying for the CPA exam. While Discover didn’t make these stresses and responsibilities magically disappear, it did allow me to take a step back, reflect and learn sustainable habits to achieve long-lasting success. More so, it was an opportunity for nine uniquely different people to forge a friendship that continues to grow today. Rebecca Evans Discover couldn’t have happened at a better time in my life. I remember heading there filled with angst and heartache. As a French native, the 2015 Paris attacks had me concerned for my family and friends back home. Upon arrival, I was randomly placed on a team with eight other senior associates from different lines of service and parts of the country. Never did I think it was the beginning of a longtime friendship. Despite having very different career paths at PwC, we immediately clicked. The team had so much in common. We all expressed interest in traveling and living a Be well, work well lifestyle. More importantly, I realized everyone faces challenges. They may not be the same as mine, but we’re all in it together. Anna Khoma Our team coach Kym Ward Gaffney created an atmosphere where the nine of us felt comfortable to truly open up and talk about things we otherwise would rarely discuss with colleagues and strangers. Bonds quickly formed and we were inseparable that week, even during times we weren’t required to be together. We started a group text thread so that we could stay in contact while at Discover. To my pleasant surprise, the thread continues today. We regularly check in on each other. Sometimes to share exciting news like having a baby, getting promoted, getting married. Other times it’s to ask for career advice or assistance in navigating the firm. I recommend every team at Discover finds a way to keep the conversation going. Paul Dwaileebe I enjoy staying in touch with my Discover friends and helping them progress in their careers here. I recently shared that I was selected to be a Digital Accelerator, and a couple of them have reached out for advice on increasing their Digital IQ. Thanks to Discover, I was able to reflect on important matters in my life. It also humanized the people I work with. We all have similar goals and challenges. It’s through these similarities we came together and it’s through the differences that we continue learn from one another and grow. Reunion time! The group has not been together in person since Discover -- but they’re currently planning a reunion. And until then, they remain one text away. Note: Everyone at the firm, regardless of role, can experience Discover. Check out the Discover Toolkit for videos, a conversation guide, and best practices for supporting Discover in your market.

People Team April 26, 2019 Appreciating and acknowledging the impact and contributions of our people not only reaffirms our values and strengthens our relationships, it also encourages others to continue delivering their best work. To fuel your team’s motivation and emotional well-being, check out these three tech-enabled tools and training resources to help you express appreciation in meaningful ways. Real-time recognition: Provide immediate appreciation for noteworthy individual or team performance and shape our recognition culture by making in-the-moment gratitude part of your every day. Through Real-time recognition, monetary and non-monetary awards celebrate those who demonstrate the firm’s values and behaviors. Check out these effective recognition tips and recognize a deserving colleague today, especially before the performance year ends on April 30! Note for budget holders: The second spend period will close on June 27 at 5 p.m. ET — if you don’t use your spending balance by then, you’ll lose it. Appreciation Bank: We often know it’s important to thank someone, yet we struggle with how to meaningfully communicate our gratitude. Learn how to express the “five languages of appreciation” — words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, quality time and spontaneous celebration — to help build deeper relationships with colleagues and clients. You can view acts of gratitude from each of the five languages and filter them by audience (individual, team and client) and method (in-person and virtual). Motivating By Appreciation Inventory: Learning in a Box: This training and its corresponding activities help create an appreciative workplace culture, broaden perspectives and teach participants how to choose the most meaningful ways to express authentic gratitude. Learning in a Box provides step-by-step instructions to easily facilitate a 60-minute in-person or virtual training session. In fact, more than 95 sessions have already been facilitated for 1,455 partners and staff. Note: If you have questions or feedback about the Motivating By Appreciation Inventory: Learning in a Box, reach out to Nicole Wong. "This learning solution resonated with every person on my team and can do the same for any group of people. Everyone wants to be appreciated — and it can be a difficult thing to ask for, so I am happy that PwC is creating the space for our teams to discuss in a candid, but organized way.” — Stephanie Nowlen, Associate If you’re interested in gaining additional insights on how, when and why to express meaningful appreciation at work, check out these curated assets in Vantage.

This small Swiss village was transformed for the week as companies, countries and groups converted shops and storefronts into their home base. The WEF and participants support international collaboration as a way of solving critical global challenges. At any given time, countless sessions were being held and leaders were engaging around topics ranging from digitization to globalization, and inclusion to economics. This week Tim Ryan was on the ground, along with members of the Network Leadership Team, to represent PwC US as our 22nd annual Global CEO Survey was released. As the week wrapped up, Tim recorded a video message with his three biggest observations. Watch his video and read on below for a peek at his calendar from a busy week. On Monday, PwC launched our 22nd annual Global CEO Survey. PwC Global Chairman Bob Moritz presented the results to World Economic Forum attendees in Davos. Among the findings this year: CEOs are tempering their expectations and are more cautious, if not pessimistic, about global growth. To learn more and share with your clients, access survey findings at www.pwc.com/us/ceosurvey (or download the PDF). Throughout the week, Tim met with members of the media, including a discussion of 21st century leadership with Eric Gertler, Chairman of US News and World report. Our internal CEO Survey - Global site is the place to find client-ready decks (exec summary or full version). More resources will be added throughout spring 2019, including sector reports (see the release schedule). On Thursday, Tim and PwC Workforce of the Future leader Carrie Duarte joined a panel discussing why caring, purpose and equality at work matter in the digital age. The panel was hosted by the Female Quotient, an organization committed to advancing diversity in the workplace. We know from our own recently released report on purpose in the workplace, "Making work more meaningful," that employees want — and expect — to be fulfilled at work. Tim shared his thoughts on Twitter (@Timothy_F_Ryan) and reacted to the CEO Survey findings with a LinkedIn blog on how business can grow even as CEOs become more cautious. You can be part of the conversation on social, too. Sign up for Social Central(now powered by the Dynamic Signal platform) to share approved messages in one click and help spread the word with your networks.

CarVal Investors had three goals: Free employees from manually intensive, repetitive processes Enable employees to focus on more important work Drive productivity We brought together a mix of One Firm thought leaders and industry experts to create a distinctive proposal. Our focus: integrating robotic process automation (RPA). Targeting three processes with RPA, we saved the client a total of 110 minutes. That's a 77% savings, using only 2% of the bot's daily capacity -- all while reducing errors and freeing up capacity at high-value times. With the appropriate mix of One Firm thought leaders and industry experts, we created a distinctive proposal for the client. Joe Wiggins, Assurance partner, received the initial call from the CFO, and brought in Danielle Valkner, Advisory partner focused on Asset Management, and Kevin Kroen, Financial Services Intelligent Automation leader, to drive the pursuit and oversee the work. The work was led by Michael Berland and Basil Carr, and the team included Siva Pinisetty and Ryan Nealon from Financial Services Advisory. The client had heard of RPA -- software easily programmed to carry out basic rules-based, repetitive tasks -- but wasn’t sure how it could benefit them. At the same time, we worked with stakeholders across their firm to find processes ripe for automation By aligning the robotics program to CarVal’s three strategic objectives of growing the business, increasing productivity and improving employee engagement, we demonstrated the value of integrating RPA across their operations. We also provided them with a business case and demos so they can work with leadership to socialize RPA and demonstrate a broader case for change. Interested in learning more about RPA?

Our "Upskilling in Action" series celebrates the successes of some of your colleagues who are accelerating their digital skills and applying them on projects and with clients. As an Industry Tax Practice (ITP) Tax manager and Digital Accelerator based in Virginia, Megan Miller is no stranger to having technology at the forefront of her client work. In fact, many of her Tax clients themselves sit within the tech sector. Megan is currently working on a large team that is helping digitize their client’s compliance processes. During a recent brainstorming session, the team began to mull over areas for improvement. As is the case across so many compliance engagements, the team had been spending a significant amount of time performing manual Excel manipulations. As the team brainstormed ways to eliminate this manual work, Megan identified an opportunity to create a batch macro. Megan built a trial balance workflow to streamline the process of mapping multiple individual entity trial balances year over year. The key difference between this workflow and the other trial balance mapping workflows available is that this new workflow is a batch macro that can map the trial balances of multiples entities all at once. Work like this can sometimes be tedious, which is why these are exactly the kinds of repeatable processes that are exciting for PwCers to find ways to automate. “This workflow is great for clients who require customized accounts,” Megan said. “Using it will save our people and their clients a significant amount of time, especially clients that have many entities or large client footprints.” “When it comes to Digital Upskilling,” Megan continued, “we need to push ourselves to keep evolving just like the firm.” Her advice for others? “Don’t assume that it is someone else's responsibility to know technology and that you can simply continue on with your normal day-to-day role. Take an active interest in your career and get onboard!” Want to build your own digital skills? A great place to start is the Digital Hub, the home to all things Digital Upskilling — available on PC and mobile via the Digital Hub app in PwC’s App Store. You’ll find pre-reads to get ready for PowerUp! games, Learning Bursts, Tech While You Trek podcasts, Digital Quests and more, including excellent third party resources too. As you complete automations, visualizations and workflows, be sure to submit them to Digital Lab — if they're accepted, you'll be sharing your expertise with your colleagues and will be rewarded. And don’t forget our FY19 Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal for everyone at PwC — join the thousands of PwCers who have already earned the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests on or before June 30, 2019. As an added incentive, get an early start through Learn2earn by completing all four Digital Quests and earning a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points before April 30 and you’ll be entered for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — one in seven will win!

Over the past year we’ve rolled out a number of key “renovations”, or enhancements, to FlexForecast, our budgeting, pricing and estimate to complete (ETC) tool: We’ve integrated with TalentLink - a significant advancement in operational efficiencies - creating an automated connection between demand and supply and allowing insight into our staffing needs like never before. We’ve upgraded functionality for the budgeting and ETC screens for an enhanced user experience. We’ve implemented the ability to enter ETC hours and rates by person, allowing us a greater level of accuracy in our ability to forecast and manage the business. And we’ve been continuously designing new enhancements, as well as integrations with other firm systems to create an operationally efficient experience for you, our engagement teams - all while working to onboard the Assurance LoS to make Flex a truly xLoS tool. The speed at which we’ve made these enhancements has also presented some challenges. As more and more gets built into the tool, its performance has taken a hit and is not currently operating at the level that we expect of a tool that is so critical to the management of our business. We understand the frustration from a user experience, particularly for those of you trying to budget or manage larger, more complex projects, and are working diligently to identify the issues and resolve as quickly as possible. Multiple fixes have been released over the past few weeks, so you should already see some improvement, but we will continue to do more. So we ask for your patience while using Flex as we get it operating again like the exceptional tool that it is. Please reach out to your Vertical Finance Teams with any questions or concerns in the meantime.

For Chloe Timothy, the opportunity to increase focus on well-being helped her rediscover a passion for composing music. The result: her debut album of original compositions on piano, “Meditation Elasticity.” It’s no surprise that Chloe turned to music. An accomplished pianist who’s currently working on a memoir, Chloe was the first woman in her home country of South Africa to earn a degree in jazz performance. Today, in her role as an executive coach, Chloe shares the importance of well-being with her internal clients every day. But she realized she was ignoring her own advice. Embracing Be well, work well “It all began when I decided to embrace Be well, work well by taking a five-minute energy break and sat in front of my piano,” Chloe reflected. “These breaks became a daily habit. I’d play on the piano and allow my emotions to take over the moment.” These informal sessions soon turned into an entire meditation album that artistically taps into the four dimensions of energy. “I was so inspired that I composed an entire album of songs,” Chloe said. “I decided to record the music on my phone and share it with a handful of friends. The feedback was overwhelming. Many of them began using my music during their daily meditation. This inspired me to professionally record the album and make it publicly available.” ‘Meditation Elasticity’ The critically acclaimed “Meditation Elasticity” was released worldwide in April. Every song ties to a dimension of energy. For example, “Rem Dreaming” (physical), “Focal Projection” (mental), “Emotional Untangling” (emotional), and “Rewire for Purpose” (spiritual). “We get so caught up in work that we forget we have tools inside ourselves that help us overcome challenges,” Chloe said. “You have the answers within.

With HP facing increasing commoditization in its core personal computing and print businesses, the client engaged PwC to identify opportunities for big data and analytics to support their transformation from a product-focused transactional company to a customer-focused services company. What was our solution for HP? We wowed HP stakeholders with the “art of the possible” by illustrating how HP can drive competitive advantage using the insights generated through analytics use cases. As a part of the proposal process, we applied BxT principles to develop user stories that got the client excited about working with us and our vision for the future. We identified over 80 use cases and 20 user stories that brought analytics to life for the client and applied our analytics transformation framework across a holistic operating model to address more than just the typical technology issues. Leveraging the Analytics &amp; AI Transformation (AAIT) Integrated Solution and the Fit for Growth platform, we led our strategy with business aligned analytics which helped the client bridge the gap across business and IT stakeholders. What results will HP see using our solution? A clear strategy for big data &amp; analytics to decrease costs and maximize profitability in existing markets and create value in an entirely new ecosystem A holistic vision, architecture, and governance model driven by business issues and enabled through technology Accelerators from our AAIT integrated solution, including a catalog of business-driven use cases to incrementally mature HP’s analytics capabilities and promote data-driven decision making across the organization A prioritized set of use cases starting with customer segmentation, customer and partner profitability, partner segmentation, and inventory management to provide ~$7-$12M of benefit to HP Meet the team! The extended pursuit team and subject matter resources engaged during this project reflected a cross-competency team from Analytics, Strategy&amp;, Strategic Technologies, and HP account team members, including: Alex Blanter (Partner, Innovation &amp; IoT SMR) Anand Rao (Partner, AI SMR) Deborah Skorupka (Partner, HP GRP) Jasmin Young (Director, XaaS SMR) Joe Palladino (Partner, HP APP) John Simmons (Partner, Data &amp; Analytics SMR) Kevin Keegan (Partner, Supply Chain SMR) Louis Bouquet (Director, Customer Service SMR) Melissa Kaplan (HP CRE) Michael Spadea (MD, Privacy &amp; GDPR SMR) Michael Whitman (Partner, Supply Chain SMR) Ritesh Ramesh (Director, Data &amp; Analytics SMR) Ro Antao (Partner, Cloud SMR) Romit Dey (Partner, XaaS SMR) Ritesh Ramesh (Director, Data &amp; Analytics SMR) Tom Casey (Partner, Technology Strategy SMR) We know there are many more stories to tell.

What is the TEA Adoption Index? The TEA Adoption Index is a metric designed to show how engagement teams are taking action to deliver on our strategy. As we scale our digital agenda, we will add additional inputs to the metric. To start, we are tracking the use of digital tools. Teams earn points by using required tools (based on client applicability): Connect V3, Client Base/CAM, Count, Audit Explorer. The adoption index score is being used strictly for awareness and to encourage the use of tools that support our tech-enabled audit strategy; these data points do not impact the bonus pool at the market level. Learn more about the TEA Adoption Index from the Q&amp;A. Have questions or want to share your feedback? Visit the Tech-enabled Audit Spark page, go to our Questions and Feedback form and select "TEA Adoption Index" from the dropdown menu. EMT360 is now Engagement360: new name, new experience As we’ve added metrics to provide new insights into your engagement, we’ve updated the name -- and the experience -- to reflect the full range of information available to your team. You can now select from a menu to view: Quick Start Pricing, Monitoring, Budgeting, Planning EGA and your team’s TEA Adoption Index. Look for “ENG360” in myMetrics to check out the new experience.

And because of this, some of us have more airline miles accumulated than we know what to do with! PwC collects frequent flier miles to help Make-A-Wish get wish kids to their dream destination - whether it be Cinderella’s Castle at Disney World or a winter wonderland to see snow for the first time. Across the U.S., the Make-A-Wish® Foundation grants wishes to children between the ages of 2 ½ and 18 with critical illnesses. This year, over 75% of wish kids will travel for their once-in-a-lifetime experience. As a result, Make-A-Wish needs 2.9 billion airline miles to fly wish kids and their families to their destination of choice. Many major airlines, including Delta, United, American, Southwest, and JetBlue, enable frequent flier members to donate to Make-A-Wish. It’s a simple but meaningful way you can help grant the wishes of children with critical illnesses. Please visit our PwC wish page to make a miles donation and Impact Space to make a monetary donation. From February 8 - April 1 we will track our Advisory donations and provide an update on how many miles we were able to share with Make-A-Wish. After you donate your miles, please document the donation in this Google Form. If you have any questions please reach out to any of these Advisory academy members, Cindy Xu, Chrissy Parylak, Josh Levitt, Stephen Robinson, Nastassja Ronge, and Matthew Mulkey. “I wish to see snow for the first time” - Shore (age 9) Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40201.html</url><pwc_title>Good news!

To support this change, we’re adjusting the eligibility requirements for the milestone sabbatical award for promotions effective July 1, 2019. Previously, we required promotees to have five years of service before they were eligible for a sabbatical. Going forward, client service staff who are promoted to senior manager and have four years of tenure or reach four years of tenure after promotion will be eligible for a sabbatical. IFS staff will be eligible for a sabbatical when they’re promoted to director and have/or reach four years of tenure after promotion. We’ve updated the Manager Milestone FAQs to reflect this change.

Today, we’re pleased to announce that we have integrated FlexForecast with TalentLink and the Deployment process -- making your life easier, and helping engagements to be more profitable. Rapidly evolving market demands mean we need to work differently -- with enhanced One Firm collaboration, efficiency and simplification and increased digitization. Project 5 Million strategy is our response to this, and the integration of FlexForecast with our Deployment process will help drive our strategy by providing enhancements to project management, budgeting and engagement monitoring. These enhancements will help us recognize time savings critical to delivering the Client Experience, digitizing our business and offering our clients more pricing options. How will the integration make your life easier and help us meet our goals? Time savings: Say goodbye to the complex, multi-step process of requesting resources and submitting budgets. Now, FlexForecast will be your single point of entry for budgeting and engagement change requests -- saving time and reducing duplication of efforts. Improved transparency and profitability: With the ability to view, discuss, and update schedules as a team, the integration creates greater visibility into engagement needs and more transparency around schedule expectations. It will also be easier to review key financial metrics and adjust in real time to achieve better margins. Making it possible to recognize capacity: Later this week, your market leader will share new Tax goal-setting placemats for staff, featuring reduced utilization targets. Thanks to the connection we are establishing between FlexForecast and TalentLink, we will have more accurate information about engagement team schedules and capacity -- a crucial step in achieving our Project 5 Million goals and quickly recognizing the value of time gained through digitization. How you can help lead this new way of working Schedule time for development: Meet your non-client chargeable hours targets with the help of increased transparency and team collaboration features. Proactively schedule time for your professional development in TalentLink -- whether this means working through modules in the Digital Fitness app, completing the Tax Foundation Milestones or building the skills necessary to deliver the Client Experience. Maintain personal schedules: A quick glance is all it takes to make sure your personal schedule in FlexForecast and TalentLink is consistent with the work to be done. Raise any concerns within your team, encouraging ongoing team discussions and updates of schedules as needed. Proactively collaborate with your team: Collaborate with your engagement team to make sure schedules are updated in real time and everyone is on the same page. Managers and Directors should regularly update engagement schedules in FlexForecast -- especially in advance of Deployment/Staffing meetings, and at the beginning of the month to be included in the monthly forecast. What’s next? You can look forward to additional enhancements to this integration later in FY19, including leadership reporting and dashboards and the ability to add information about TBD staff. In addition, when the firmwide Contract to Code tracker is launched, the FlexForecast budget will be included as one step of the engagement planning process.

Priority “Priority” is a new section of Google Drive that surfaces files that — just like the name says — are top priorities: files that you and your team use frequently, plus content and tasks that need your attention. Big ups to machine learning! You’re also able to take action (like replying to comments or reviewing recent edits) on suggested documents without even opening the files. Just click “Priority” in Drive’s left navigation menu to view Priority files. The Google Drive mobile app will default to the “Priority” view. Workspaces The Priority section also features Workspaces — easy-to-access and customizable locations to create and organize your files. Any files you have access to (including My Drive and Team Drives) can be collected and sorted however works best for you. And moving files around to suit your fancy won’t change where they are stored in Drive or who has access to them. When files are typically opened together or share common collaborators, Google will suggest creating a new workspace. Simply click “Save as workspace” and then add or remove files as needed. Drive can display up to eight active workspaces at one time, with up to 25 files per workspace. Workspaces are unique to you and cannot be shared. But, they are mobile if you use the Google Drive app (available in PwC’s App Store). To create and manage workspaces on mobile, simply click on the icon with the three dots at the bottom of the app. #PwCUSIT Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40211.html</url><pwc_title>Dr. Who?

Understand the behaviors PwC expects from you by completing your Independence, Ethics and Compliance training by Tuesday, April 23, 11:59 p.m. ET. It’s a Core Compliance Requirement with a firm deadline — there’s no grace period. The training begins with an escape room challenge required for everyone. Once you complete the challenge, you decide how to finish the rest of the mobile-enabled training. There are two versions to choose from: one that’s CPE-eligible, and another containing shorter learning modules that isn’t eligible for CPE. You only need to complete one, so decide which one you’ll take depending on your CPE credit needs. If you’re a manager or above and don’t need CPE credit, you can test your skills and save time -- pass a knowledge assessment in lieu of the course requirements. Please note: Once you've completed, be patient. There might be a delay with completion records synchronizing and moving to the "Completed Tasks" tab on your My Compliance Dashboard. Learn more Explore the Independence, Ethics &amp; Compliance site and be sure to complete this Core Compliance Requirement by the deadline of Tuesday, April 23. Go to My Compliance Dashboard to get started now. Don’t forget your Pressures &amp; Demands training for associates and non-exempt staff If you haven’t completed your Pressures &amp; Demands course, don’t forget to complete it, too. It’s also available on My Compliance Dashboard.

Over the past two weeks, more than 150 organizations with more than 615,000 people participated in the Day of Understanding. And inside PwC, we held close to 300 sessions to bring our managers, directors and managing directors together to look at diversity and inclusion from a different perspective.They also learned what they can do to make the experience for every person at PwC even better. I’ve heard from many who participated in the sessions inside PwC that this was an eye-opening discussion. It gave them new insights into what an inclusive culture really looks like and a sense of ownership and purpose in how they can make an impact. One person shared that this was, “Probably the most useful, realistic training I've seen in a long time.” And another one of our leaders said: “I want people to know I’m not perfect, but I care.” For those managers and directors who were unable to attend the in-person session, two virtual options will be available on Jan. 8 and 11. Details will be coming via email soon after the holiday break. We’ve started this conversation with our partners and managers, but it doesn’t end there. We will keep this commitment at the forefront of how we move forward as an organization and you will hear about more opportunities to make an impact in the spring and summer. But don’t wait until then to do something important: Take the CEO Action “I Act On” pledge and personally commit to supporting inclusion and driving action at PwC and in your community. This commitment to diversity and inclusion also reached our clients and communities. More than 100 of our colleagues volunteered their time to help our clients and other organizations be part of the Day of Understanding and the response has been inspiring. Partner Shelley Giberson helped to facilitate a 90-minute discussion on unconscious bias with one of our large non-audit clients. “The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The CEO spoke passionately about the importance of D&amp;I and went out of his way to compliment PwC on our leadership. Many approached us at the conclusion of our session to talk about how meaningful it was.” I also heard directly from our clients. The CEO of one of our large manufacturing clients wrote, “We completed a very impactful Day of Understanding on Friday with over 20 discussion groups around the world. I led a group in our world headquarters and we had an incredibly impactful conversation as people ‘shared their story.’ Thanks for your leadership on this important issue. You and your team are catalysts on a transformational opportunity.” Team, I am incredibly proud and I hope this gives you a sense of what we can accomplish when we move together. As one of our colleagues said, we are not a perfect firm -- but we care, we’re working to continue to get better and help others to be better, too. A huge thanks to all who contributed to our efforts inside and outside the firm this week.

Read about the policy update and approva Do you work on C2 Provisions? Read about the policy update and approval requirements for all Tax Accounting Service (TAS) engagements One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 25, 2019 Tax accounting service (“TAS”) engagements present unique and potentially significant risk to the firm, primarily as a result of the engagement’s relationship to our client’s financial statements. Such engagements include the following: Tax provision preparation or review Accounting for uncertain tax positions Tax accounting performance improvement GHRS Pension/OPEB valuation, stock-based compensation accounting or deferred tax related services (ASC 712, 715, 718 and/or 740). Because of the risk profile of such engagements, tax engagement teams should be aware of the risk management protocols to help teams mitigate the risks on these engagements. One such protocol requires that all tax accounting service engagements for non-audit clients be approved by a TAS Market Leader or a GHRS Accounting Services Leader. In addition, tax accounting service engagements that have been designated as high risk require OFRO Tax approval and the approval and active involvement of a Concurring Partner (“CP”) with tax accounting experience. Effective 11/7/2018, all non-restricted (C2) Tax provision review/preparation engagements are required to be restricted in DMS (see the Policy: Confidentiality and DMS access ). All approvals should be obtained during the engagement acceptance process and prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. Engagement teams should select the characteristics that apply to the engagement when completing the A&amp;C engagement acceptance assessment to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained during the Engagement Acceptance process. When providing tax accounting services for non-audit clients, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check restriction in Salesforce first (or Central Entity Service (“CES”)) to determine if client is a non-audit client If a non-audit client, initiate the engagement acceptance assessment in A&amp;C Obtain TAS/GHRS leader approval and, if applicable, OFRO Tax and CP approvals Execute engagement contract Begin work For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that a different approval process applies to engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients. Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

The client wanted to improve forecasting accuracy so that monthly closes would drive a better-informed, data-driven budgeting and forecasting approach. To test the above hypothesis, the client needed tocompare plan vs. actual financial data on both a retrospective and go-forward basis. The PwC Digital Experience: The client’s plan and actual data were housed in disparate systems, therefore significant data manipulation was required to complete the comparison. A Digital Accelerator leveraged Alteryx’s workflow capabilities to drive efficiencies in data preparation. The team then used Tableau to identify forecasting challenges and analyze the impact of implementing materiality thresholds to various finance-related processes (e.g. Variance Analysis, Topside JEs). The Value Created: For our client, we made monthly analysis a reality by analyzing the impact of monthly closes on the client’s budgeting and forecasting approach. In addition, the client can focus on higher value-add analyses and insight generation by implementing materiality thresholds. For PwC, using Tableau as a tool to analyze financial data sets allows us to determine potential improvement opportunities that can drive project expansions, and significant time savings. In this project, the use of Alteryx and Tableau saved ~100 hours of labor.

How do you get started with artificial intelligence? Do you have the right AI talent? How will tax reform affect investment in AI development? From the boardroom to the breakroom, AI is becoming part of every business conversation. We know it’s on our clients’ minds — and our new report, “AI Predictions in 2018,” takes a look at the big picture, putting a stake in the ground on the most important AI issues businesses will face in 2018. More than two dozen PwC leaders from across the US and UK firms weighed in on what AI means, and the results are relevant regardless of your line, sector or market. Here’s what those leaders see collectively in the crystal ball — and what businesses need to know in the coming months: AI will impact employers before it impacts employment. AI will hardly ruffle the job market in 2018. But since it demands new structures, enterprises will feel pressure to retool. AI will come down to earth — and get to work. It may not make a good science fiction film, but AI is ready to automate complex processes, identify trends to create business value, and provide forward-looking intelligence. AI will help answer the big question about data. AI isn’t the only answer to the ROI question about data integration and technology initiatives, but it’s an answer that comes with business cases. Functional specialists, not techies, will decide the AI talent race. Computer scientists are important, but domain experts with the skills to work with AI — and AI experts — are crucial for enterprise success. Cyberattacks will be more powerful because of AI — but so will cyberdefense. One job where AI has already shown clear superiority over human beings? Hacking. And now it will be crucial to your cybersecurity strategy. Opening AI’s black box will become a priority. A risk of AI: We won’t understand why it does what it does. The lack of trust will hurt adoption — but solutions are coming. Nations will spar over AI. It’s not a trade war but a research, investment and talent war, and China is moving fast. Pressure for responsible AI won’t just be on tech companies. A global consensus is emerging around principles for responsible AI to safeguard organizations and drive business value.

Is less more in M&amp;A? Platforms July 26, 2018 Overall deals volume in the US may be down, but those that have been announced are bigger and gaining momentum. Megadeals -- transactions of at least $5 billion -- are happening more frequently (doubling from a year ago to an average of two per week) and growing in size (up to $14 billion in the first half of 2018 from $11 billion in the same period last year). PwC’s Q2 2018 Deals Day insights summarize why the demands for growth -- and firms’ willingness to grow at mega-scale -- will keep overall M&amp;A value strong in the months ahead. PwC’s Deals insights are just one way we offer value -- by helping clients make sense of complex issues. Here's what you need to know when discussing the current deals landscape with clients: Value up, volume down: While megadeal volume is up, overall deals volume continues to dip. The second quarter saw the fewest deals since Q4 2015. At the same time, average value per deal has soared, with last quarter delivering twice the value of the same period a year ago. Cross-sector continues: Of more than 5,000 corporate deals, 40% involved a buyer going outside its sector. Tech gets a lot of headlines, as consumer, media and telecom companies have been active acquirers, but that dynamic goes both ways. Jump in IPOs: Values are up in the US IPO markets, as the $16 billion raised last quarter was about one-fourth above Q2 2017. Half of the 66 IPOs occurred in June, the highest monthly total in more than seven years. Cross-border concerns: The geopolitical environment remains turbulent amid tariffs and a greater scrutiny of deals. The value of deals by non-US buyers of US companies is down, and the volume of both inbound and outbound US M&amp;A is down from a year ago. To learn more, please read these resources and share with your clients: Diversify or double down: The time for a deal is now, Q2 2018 Deals insights page Q2 2018 Deals Day commentary by John Potter, US Deals Sector Leader Deals is one of five PwC platforms designed to help us address the areas most important to our non-audit clients.

A joint business relationship (JBR) between PwC and another entity or person may include activities ranging from joint marketing and proposals to joint service offerings and oversight. A JBR can even result just from being a presenter at a conference or other public venue. Alliances and other recurring joint business relationships can present significant market growth opportunities for PwC as they can generate lucrative professional services revenues and provide an effective way to broaden our ability to deliver a wide range of high quality services to our clients. However, alliances and other JBRs can also pose significant risks and potential issues when not engaged or managed appropriately. The Business Relationships: Independence guidance link provides a framework for identifying and evaluating situations that may create a JBR and: describes attributes and other factors that help us determine whether a JBR is direct or indirect, provides examples of direct and indirect JBRs, as well as situations which would not be considered JBRs by applying the framework to different scenarios, and summarizes the process for evaluating, approving and tracking JBRs Identifying activities with another entity or person that could create a JBR (or the appearance of a JBR): The following activities and events could create a JBR which would need to be evaluated under the JBR process. Integrated Activities: Submitting a joint proposal under a prime-subcontractor arrangement. Co-developing or combining products or services with another entity. Generating business for another entity, or sharing revenues, risks, and rewards with another entity. Jointly publishing a book or other publication, or working together on "thought leadership" with another entity. Using products or services purchased from another entity and including them as an integral part of a client deliverable to a third party. Sharing information, expertise, or materials that are not available to others (such as client lists or other confidential business information) with another entity. Events: Conducting training together or providing training on another entity's products or services to a third party. Co-hosting or organizing an event (i.e., creating the agenda, inviting speakers, sending invitations) with another entity. Being the only speaker or being overly prominent at another entity’s event. Participating in an event in which PWC’s speaking role includes a discussion about and/or promotion of another entity’s products or services or the underlying purpose of the event is to promote another entity’s products or services. Marketing: Co-branding activities such as displaying the PwC corporate identity, logo, trademark or trade-name alongside that of just one other entity. Exclusively referring, promoting, or marketing or generating leads for another entity. Marketing another entity's products or services (with or without compensation). Endorsing, supporting, or otherwise making promotional statements about another entity (and vice versa). There is a guide intended to provide a standardized network-wide approach to managing risks associated with a JBR. The Joint Business Relationships Roadmap: A guide to managing risks was prepared by Global R&amp;Q with input from global and various territory business, Alliances &amp; Channels, OGC, Independence and R&amp;Q representatives. It outlines steps that PwC firms should follow to evaluate, put into place and then manage various types of JBRs. It also includes relevant contact information and some collaboration agreement templates. There is also a short "Quick Guide" version of the JBR Roadmap, titled “JBRs – A Roadmap for Partner Sponsors”. Both the JBR Roadmap and the Quick Guide are posted on the Network Alliances &amp; Channels Spark page at this link: https://pwc-spark.com/docs/DOC-307594. For further information and guidance on Joint Business Relationships, there is a JBR Computer Based Training Course included in L&amp;D's Vantage System (search for Joint Business Relationships), or contact Eileen Connolly or Connie Crosley in the Joint Business Relationship Management Group (JBRMG) with questions.

What I hear again and again is our clients want our perspective. One way I share my perspective is through a quarterly letter to over 850 CEOs. I reflect on my travels and conversations and send them an update on the big themes I’m hearing. I just sent my latest update last week, and I’m sharing it with you as well because I hope you’ll find it helpful for your own client discussions. What is very interesting to me is the similarity between the issues our clients are thinking about and the challenges we face at PwC. Our clients are confronting fierce competition, they want to prepare their employees to work in a digital world, and they’re focused on how they execute their strategy (just like us). What I find is that when I share what we’re doing at PwC -- whether that is Your Tomorrow, Be well, work well or Digital Fitness -- they are very interested. My first instinct is always to keep the conversation focused on our clients, so it’s been a learning experience for me. I’m now seeing how sharing the things we’re doing inside PwC can get the conversation rolling and build even more credibility with clients who are solving these same challenges. One last thought … As I meet with our clients, I’m not only listening for opportunities to assist them, I’m also listening to see whether our direction as a firm is the right one. What I continue to see is that aspiring to be a firm that is purpose-led and values-driven, that listens to what our clients tell us, and that is investing and securing the future for all of us is exactly the right destination for our firm.

With Your Tomorrow, we’re digitally enabling our business by investing in our people through digital upskilling and providing them with the tools and technologies that are aligned with market forces -- to deliver higher quality and value, a more digital experience and all at a lower cost. But are employers and employees aligned in thinking that continuous deployment of digital tools at work delivers more productivity, flexibility and innovation from the workforce? In a recent report in PwC’s Consumer Intelligence Series (CIS), we asked more than 12,000 full-time working adults in seven countries about their experiences with technology at work to find out -- and the findings were surprising. Leaders say they’re choosing tech with their people’s needs in mind, but employees don’t agree 90% of C-suite executives agree their company pays attention to people’s needs when introducing new technology. But only about half (53%) of staff say the same. 92% of C-suite execs say they’re satisfied with the technology experience their company provides for making progress on their most important work, only 68% of staff agree. 73% of people surveyed say they know of systems that would help them produce higher-quality work. The CIS survey explores the disconnect between what the C-suite says and their employees experience, breaks down what motivates people to adopt new tech at work, and offers insights to get more buy-in from employees. Read the CIS survey results, and access additional CIS survey resources, including the web page and video, briefing deck, talking points and social messages to share with your clients now. Embracing technology for better outcomes is essential not just for business success, but for training and retaining a motivated workforce. Use the report’s valuable insights as another way to share PwC's Digital Story and to help your clients not just embrace technology, but build a thriving long-term relationship.

We hope they inspire you to use our technology tools and Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Have you seen a difficult math problem in your client or daily work and didn't know how to begin solving it? Faced with an incredibly complex IRS valuation formula, this team came together to bring value to the client by leveraging technology to solve the problem. Eventually, they’ll help future teams through Digital Lab with your input. When tax planning for a client, Hunter Anderson, a manager in Personal Financial Services, was faced with a complicated charitable contribution. Although his team knew how to do the return, when looking at regulations from the Treasury, they came across a highly complex formula no one on the team had seen before in practice. Thankfully, through One Firm relationships, a solution was found. Hunter had contacts with Victor Lopes, a Digital Accelerator, who was able to make a connection to David Resseguie and Karla Benefiel from the overall Digital Lab team. Together, they rapidly identified a solution using technology. We talked to them to learn more: Hunter: “We were in a high stress situation — no one I knew could help the client. People with the firm for more than two decades had never seen this type of charitable contribution.” David: “We now have access to specialists that we never had before. We are hiring from all different types of backgrounds and building this community. I have a computer science background, and although I didn’t know half of the tax jargon involved in the formula Hunter approached us with, I knew how to interpret the math function and crunch the numbers using a programming language. But, I wanted to show the work in a way that could be checked by the domain experts on the Tax team.” Karla: “Using interactive computing notebooks was a great way to facilitate sharing. It is a common place where all work is able to be shown for reviews and approvals, and you are able to plug in numbers to solve problems in seconds. Plus, even though this formula is rare, if we build up a library of difficult problems like it in notebooks, we can tag them, eventually upload them to Digital Lab, and then if others run into the same problem in the future, we have pre-built solutions they can use. No need to re-invent. We can leverage the firm’s collective intelligence.” Victor: “Even though I wasn’t able to calculate the solution myself, it was easy to review David’s work in the Notebook. Using Excel for this type of problem is very manual; I couldn’t predict how many hours it would take, plus the work would not be visible for others to check, which you need in a complicated scenario like this.” Hunter: “Even though I wasn’t familiar with the notebooks technology, Victor was able to walk me through David’s work. It was signed off, submitted and will result in a multi-million dollar charitable deduction that is great from a tax perspective for our client. I want to express appreciation for this team and the connections made. I knew we had people out there in the firm that would be able to solve the math, but the process was so quick, with the workbook turned around in a day.” David: “Now that we have successfully solved this problem, we want to use it as a stepping stone to create a larger solution for rare, niche formulas and calculations. While uploading just this solution to Digital Lab may not be helpful to the masses, the goal is to grow a collection of calculations that touch all areas of the firm. No need to do the difficult math, you could just enter the values needed and run your calculation. So, you won’t find this niche formula on Digital Lab today, but send us your complex equations and formulas, and we will have a collection of them uploaded soon.” Have a difficult math problem? Tell us about it here, so we may be able to add it to the collection on Digital Lab. Have you already earned 150 points in Digital Lab, fulfilling that portion of the Learn2earn challenge?

It’s Chat -- a powerful instant messaging platform and so much more. The change will roll out across the firm this weekend. By Monday, you’ll be able to: Send screenshots, transfer files and share documents (finally!) Create “Rooms” for up to 8,000 participants (where you can save data and conversation history for six months to track project discussions) Send “Direct messages” (these messages disappear after 24 hours, just like Hangouts) Start a Meet video conference with a simple click (it’s really that easy!) Chat with your PwC colleagues around the globe (Chat has already been rolled out to all other territories currently using Google) Rediscover your old GIFs and emojis from the days of Notes Sametime (you can share those, too!) What happens to Hangouts? Don’t worry, Google is not retiring “classic” Hangouts -- yet. While the rollout of Chat completes Google’s separation of “classic” Hangouts into two distinct apps (Chat and Meet), Google will keep Hangouts available for some time as Chat continues to evolve. One-to-one messages shared in Chat will be visible in Hangouts and vice versa. However, Rooms, screenshots, files, documents, Group messages and invitations to Chat groups will only be shareable in Chat. We encourage you and your teams to transition to Chat so you can easily share and view all parts of the conversations without missing a beat. To chat (starting Monday), visit chat.google.com via your PC (right-click the browser tab to pin it) and download the mobile app from PwC’s App Store or Google Work Play. There’s an easy way to get all the Google apps in PwC’s App Store: tap Categories, then Google Essentials, then ↓ to download the entire suite. A Chat desktop app is coming soon. If you want to learn more: View this short video or read this document Visit the G Suite Learning Center Watch the Google Chat recorded US IT Connect ‘n’ Learn session The fine print: Don’t discuss or post US client and/or engagement related data in Google Chat Rooms. Client work should be documented as required by policy in the system of record for your respective practice. Keep your communications professional. Don’t write anything in Chat that you wouldn’t write in email or other channels. Treat Chat with the same expected standards of professionalism and understanding of risk as you would on other platforms. Posts older than six months in Rooms will be deleted. One-on-one chat and group chat will expire after 24 hours. Be sure to follow the US Google Business Rules when using Chat or other Google collaboration tools. No, we won’t be getting Slack any time soon (doesn’t pass security checks). You should continue to use your current Salesforce Chatter groups to connect with your Account teams and for all Salesforce related information -- Google Chat does not replace Chatter. While we are making Chat available now, rest assured we’re moving fast and innovating to continue to roll out other Chat features in the future. Stay tuned!

It’s taken initiative and effort from our teams as we all commit to staying informed and connected -- and as we reach the milestone of 100 days since the law was passed in December, it’s amazing to see how much we’ve accomplished in that time. During April, we'll feature a series in PwC Inside showcasing opportunities, results we’ve helped our clients achieve, and details on what's ahead for tax reform. To kick it off, here are some One Firm highlights: With our skills, size, market presence, client relationships and, most importantly, our purpose -- we will continue to guide our clients through these changes.

Our "Upskilling in Action" series celebrates the successes of some of your colleagues who are accelerating their digital skills and applying them on their projects and with their clients. Lori Smith is a Tampa-based senior manager in National Real Estate who, in her own words “tries to help my team in any way I can. Becoming more digitally fit was a great way to add value by automating the data we come across on a daily basis — and telling a better story with that data.” By becoming a Digital Accelerator and using resources in the Digital Hub, Lori has learned to work with data-wrangling tools to save time by automating and accelerating the data that supports the dashboards her team uses to measure and determine office space occupancy firmwide. “We’re now able to automatically download data using data analytics tools to arrive at our space growth projections — eliminating the need to do so manually. It’s now faster and more effective to get this predictive data to the leaders who manage office space,” she says. For Lori, a more digital mindset is just one of the many positive byproducts of embracing technology. “Now I want to automate anything I can get my hands on. A task that took an entire day in the past might now take as little as five minutes, giving me more time to help my team.” Asking better questions through design thinking has been another positive change. “New ways of thinking can help you draw insights in surprisingly new ways.” Lori advises: “Don’t become overwhelmed; take the leap and go for it! Being open minded and not stuck in the same way of doing things is the biggest takeaway for me. I now look for opportunities to use what I’ve learned. And I can’t wait to build a bot. I love how the firm is making an investment in us; it will help us all stay competitive.” "Today Lori is a champion for change and is excited at the possibilities for the future," says Real Estate Strategy Leader Peter Barnett. "She sends our team Harvard Business Review articles on why failure is healthy and urges others to think outside the box. The contributions she'll be able to make in real estate towards the future of our people experience are already being realized." Want to build your own digital skills? A good place to start is the Digital Hub, the home to all things Digital Upskilling — available on PC and mobile via the Digital Hub app in PwC’s App Store. You’ll find pre-reads to get ready for PowerUp! games, Learning Bursts, Tech While You Trek podcasts, Digital Quests and more. As you complete automations, visualizations and workflows, be sure to submit them to Digital Lab — if they're accepted, you'll be sharing your expertise with your colleagues and will be rewarded! And don’t forget our FY19 Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal for everyone at PwC — earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests on or before June 30, 2019. As an added incentive, get an early start through Learn2earn by completing all four Digital Quests and earning a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points before April 30 and you’ll be entered for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win! Have a great Digital Upskilling experience or success story to share? Tell us about it here and we might feature you in an upcoming article.

Would our people understand the critical importance of upping our game and building our digital skills so we can stay confident, credible and competitive now and in the future? The answer? A resounding yes! In just three weeks, close to 3,500 people self nominated for the chance to become a Digital Accelerator. We were thrilled by the enthusiasm! The selection committee then went to work to carefully review each nomination -- all of which included essays or videos. And it wasn’t easy. (Get an inside look at clips from some of the video submissions here.) It’s clear that you’re ready to deliver on our Your Tomorrow promise: to digitally enable PwC and secure a future that takes us in exciting new directions. You understand the investment we’re making in you to help develop your skills, while providing the tools and processes you need to reimagine the possible -- and to make your lives easier. And you’re excited to use your new digital knowledge and skills to meet the needs of the market, our clients and our firm. With Your Tomorrow, we’re creating an engine of innovation driven by the combination of our people plus technology. Our Digital Accelerators will help us use technology to innovate on our engagements and meet our clients’ need for more value, a more digital experience at a competitive cost. Here’s our first class of Digital Accelerators -- ready to lift off What’s next for these Digital Accelerators? The first class of Digital Accelerators will begin their mission at one of four world-class Liftoff onboarding sessions, with the first class beginning July 24. Following onboarding, depending on their lines of service/IFS, Digital Accelerators will take what they have learned and continue their training while applying their new knowledge into their assignments on the ground. What’s next for all of us? While the next call for Digital Accelerator self nominations won’t occur until later in FY19, there are many things we all can do now to build our digital skills. For instance, we can continue on our journey to Digital Fitness through the Digital Fitness app and accessing the digital assets in Vantage (while you’re there, sign up for daily tech updates from MIT Tech Review!). And we’ll soon launch a variety of easily consumable Digital Fitness learning assets, delivered in unexpected ways, with the goal of bringing everyone in the firm to the Digital Fitness level by September 2019. We’ll start the launch of this exciting cascade with our “Tech While You Trek” podcast series, within the soon-to-launch PwC Podcast app later this summer. You can find the latest podcasts now by searching “Tech While You Trek” on Vantage. Congratulations to our first class of Digital Accelerators, and good luck to all of you on your digital mission!

Throughout FY19, we’re sharing Real-time recognition tips. In this article, we focus on quick ways to offer recognition during busy times. You may be thinking that with a growing “to-do” list and a limited amount of hours in a day, finding time to recognize colleagues can be challenging. You barely have enough time to read this article, right? Have no fear because Real-time recognition is here! With our tech-enabled tool, you can quickly and easily contribute to our recognition culture and make someone feel valued. Studies show that people who consistently practice gratitude report greater physical, emotional and social well-being. By regularly noticing and appreciating great work in manageable bites, it becomes a simple and enjoyable part of your routine, even with a hectic schedule. Consider the following ways you can easily fit Real-time recognition into your day: Say “thank you” on the go with the Globoforce mobile app. Reminder: If you’re a budget holder, you can find your available spending balance in myMetrics or on the Real-time recognition site. During a quick break, glance at the Recognition activity feed to congratulate a few colleagues — it only takes seconds to have a significant impact on them. If you suddenly remember a colleague deserves gratitude, but you’re about to walk into a meeting, create a calendar reminder to send them recognition at a more convenient time. More info: Budget holders: the second spend period will close on June 27 at 5 p.m. ET — if you don’t use your spending balance by then, you’ll lose it. Visit the Appreciation Bank for ways that our people flex their communication style to express the five languages of appreciation, which helps build deeper relationships with colleagues and clients. Healthy Habits: You can add “Appreciate Others” to your Healthy Habits in Virgin Pulse. Find it under the Emotional dimension in Managing Emotions, and add it to your Healthy Habits for daily tracking. Relationship Leaders: You can see if your assignees have been recognized by clicking the "My team" link on the Recognition home page (based on your Workday supervisory org).

They quickly found out that the lengthy surrogacy process was bumpy and complex and the expense involved would challenge their finances. After one unsuccessful pregnancy, Ryan and his husband were back to the drawing board. Financial challenges risked further delaying their dream of having a family. However, while they were on their journey, firm leadership started discussions regarding potentially providing surrogacy benefits. On July 1, the firm expanded its adoption benefits to include surrogacy. Eligible staff can now be reimbursed up to $25,000 per child for costs associated with adoption and/or surrogacy agreements. Offering this new family care benefit is one way we support all of our families including our LGBT+ parents and part of what helped PwC be named No. 5 on Fortune’s Best Workplace for Parents list. This benefit is already making a significant impact for staff members like Ryan. “Thanks in part to this benefit, we were able to start a second attempt. We were really humbled by the support we received from my local Dallas PCS team during our journey and the firm as a whole. I am just really grateful to work for a firm that continuously aims to do the right thing.” On Aug. 31, 2018, Ryan and his husband joyously welcomed their newborn son, Rory Wilder Layman. Transitioning into his new life as a parent was made easier by the firm’s eight week paternity leave. “Having a newborn is a major change,” Ryan says. “The eight weeks off allowed me to disconnect from work and focus on family. I was able to adjust and transition into fatherhood nicely.” Ryan, who recently returned from his leave, says he doesn’t work less, just differently. “My team made the transition back to work very smooth. I’ve been able to balance priorities while still attending to family when needed. I’m just very appreciative for all the time and flexibility that the firm has given me to get settled with our new addition,” Ryan says. We wish Ryan and his growing family all the best.

Behind the scenes of Di We are IFS: An IFS team in the curator's seat. Behind the scenes of Digital Lab IFS Jan. 3, 2019 “We are IFS” focuses on inspiring stories from our IFS colleagues. What happens when automations are submitted to Digital Lab? Before being published for firmwide use, they first go through the Digital Lab Governance &amp; Curation Team, a group of our IFS colleagues based in Tampa. “Think of Digital Lab as a storefront that houses fantastic automations developed by our own people,” said Director Jay Krames. “When an automation is submitted through Digital Lab, we work closely with the “authors” -- those who submit the automations -- to make sure certain necessary steps are taken before it gets published and becomes available to everyone.” “Our people, IFS and client service teams alike, often create automations for their own projects. The Governance &amp; Curation team’s job is to help evolve and optimize this great work to make it useful and beneficial for everyone at the firm,” Jay continued. Governance is always the first step; this team makes sure each automation meets PwC’s quality and data confidentiality standards (including removal of client data). Then, the team helps post the submission, adding tips and descriptions to help others find and understand the automation. The Governance &amp; Curation team also looks for opportunities to bundle and package individual automations together to enable even broader automation opportunities. “A single automation might save one person six hours; but bundled with similar submissions, we can sometimes lay the groundwork for saving thousands of hours collectively for people across the firm,” said Jay. While returning hours back to the firm and engagement teams is the main goal, monitoring the automations for relevance and quality once they become available to everyone is another. “When automations are published, we keep tabs on the ratings and commentary and pay attention to which automation themes are hot, trending and most used,” Jay says. “It’s a great way for authors and users to interact and for solutions to continue to evolve.” Get more Don’t miss the top five most popular Digital Lab automations for IFS.

He was joined by a panel of leading voices on the topic: Working Mother President Subha Barry, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Ronan Farrow, and HeForShe campaign founder Elizabeth Nyamayaro. The panel engaged in a candid conversation that explored a number of timely societal issues and shared powerful personal experiences that helped shape their views on gender equality. The highlight reel: Elizabeth explained why engaging men is a central focus of HeForShe: “We need male engagement. Because men hold the power in society at all levels: politically, socially, economically — women are underrepresented. So really, the idea is to say, you know, ‘hey guys, let’s work together. This is for all of us.’ Because when women benefit, men benefit as well.” Subha shared her advice from working on Wall Street at a time when very few women did. “I would say to women, especially who are starting out in the business world, you know if you are lucky enough to be able to find a job that measures you objectively and you have the gumption and guts to stand up and barrel through the walls, go for it.” Ronan shared his experience reporting on the #MeToo movement and gave advice to men concerned about being called out: “The fundamental maxim that boils down is pretty simple. Read the room. Read another person. Treat people with respect. That last sentence will get you through everything. Just treat people with respect.” All three panelists demonstrated how one person can make a big difference. Elizabeth summed it up with an African proverb: “If you think you’re too small to make a difference, try sleeping in a room with a mosquito.” If you missed the webcast or would like to watch it again, click here to access a replay.

Verizon Connect expanded its capabilities in fleet management and connected vehicles with two recent acquisitions. Post merger, Verizon Connect recognized the need to standardize sales, marketing and service processes and clean up leftover technical and duplicative processes. Our client saw the challenge of driving this transformation while maintaining business as usual for their day to day operations. How did we propose to solve the client’s problem? Leveraging the Sales &amp; Marketing Excellence (S&amp;ME) and Anything as a Service (XaaS) Integrated Solutions, our team looked beyond the technology and put the end user experience first. We brought the Sales, Marketing and Service teams at Verizon together with the technology team to collaborate early and often. Our PwC team proposed a “Global Standard” process upfront, aligning all stakeholders on how the teams would operate globally, and demonstrating that we could lay the proper foundation for their continued growth. We developed a standardized process to enable global consistency and business flexibility, meet the unique needs of the two business units targeted at small and medium business, versus Enterprise. What started as a $4M engagement has expanded to $10M+ by identifying opportunities to: Enhance the Salesforce experience. Transform Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) and Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM) processes. Increase &amp; improve the use of analytics. Additional projects related to helping Verizon Connect’s ability to sell. What outcome will our client see? We are projecting to achieve: Aggressive growth targets Standardized end-to-end processes for sales, marketing and customer service Reduction in license costs Improved cross-application visibility of key sales information (pipeline, client data, after sale activities) Though we’re mid-transformation, we’ve already reduced technical complexity of the end state Salesforce CRM (rationalized hundreds of fields simplifying the UX).

After learning about a 20+ year civil war that ravaged the country and tore families apart, Angie felt compelled to help the defenseless children caught in the middle. A simple Google search for volunteer opportunities in Uganda would be the beginning of a 10-year relationship she established with BULA (Better Understanding of Life in Africa), a nonprofit that empowers children and youth in vulnerable situations. After joining PwC in 2015, Angie was able to remain active with BULA and provide even more support. “I’m grateful to work for a firm and team that values making a difference,” she said. “With flexibility, Impact Space and Dollars for Doers, I’m continuing my work to solve an important problem -- ensuring children grow up in loving, protective families, not institutions.” Taking advantage of the firm’s unprescribed community investment time and the firmwide holiday shutdown, Angie traveled from Austin, Texas, to Kampala, Uganda, for three weeks to visit with BULA staff and help them plan for the new year. In addition to running various workshops, Angie made the holiday season special for sponsored students and youths by organizing social gatherings, preparing gifts and spending quality time with her new friends. Angie credits the firm for making her a more valuable volunteer and professional. “I have been able to further develop our staff in Uganda and the young adults I work with by leveraging what I’ve learned from PwC’s development approach,” she said. To date, thanks to the generosity of her colleagues, Angie has raised $1,750 for BULA's Uganda Care Leavers (UCL) initiative — a social welfare project designed to support children, youths and adults who have spent all or part of their childhood in institutional care. The funds raised will allow for BULA to host more training and workshops, reach out to additional care leavers and generate a robust report to share with other key NGOs and stakeholders so that childcare services can improve globally. Check out this short video to learn more about BULA. Do you have a story to share? Let us know.

Protection of confidential data is part of having a One Firm disciplined approach to how we provision, store, secure, use, expose and access data. This is an increasingly sensitive area for our clients, and this change is being made to enhance our data-protection controls. Data governance is at the heart of the firm’s strategy and is an underpinning of digital enablement. What’s changing? Saving files to any sort of removable media device, including firm-issued encrypted USB drives, will no longer be permitted. You will be able to transfer files from an encrypted device to your PC; however, changes cannot be saved back to the device from your PC. How will this impact my work? We anticipate minimal impact to partners and staff. Several engagement teams are already using secure sites within their line of service or client-specific web applications to share data. A list of preferred methods of data transmittal and collaboration tools is available in Spark. What if a client gives me a USB flash drive? Many clients are also moving away from the use of removable media devices. However, if you do need to access data from a client-issued USB, you will be able to save files from the encrypted device to your PC. What if my PC is not big enough to hold all of my files? Our new Windows 10 PCs have far more storage space than our previous PCs. You should review your files at the end of each engagement or project, save all documentation to the appropriate system of record and dispose of any files that are not subject to retention. What if there is an urgent situation, and I absolutely need to use removable media? While these instances are expected to be limited, it is understandable that there may be situations where a removable media device is the only solution. Temporary permission may be requested by reviewing policy guidance and submitting a security exception request with appropriate approval. More details about this process will be available soon. #PwCUSIT Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/39181.html</url><pwc_title>Digital innovation from the outside in</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-08-20 00:03:05</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>news-type:Firmwide|source:HQ News</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-04-15 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:HQ News</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Digital innovation from the outside in Digital innovation from the outside in HQ News April 15, 2019 For the past year, a group of 15 Assurance Digital Accelerators have been working on the IBM Corporation engagement, supporting the team in delivering a significant volume of new system and organization controls (SOC) reporting services driven by IBM's emerging technology transformation, while concurrently developing automation to realize significant engagement margin gains. The team has made an impact at the global client level in this short time as well -- growing the total worldwide engagements. Citizen-led innovation has been at the cornerstone of how this DA team approached their work. Specific examples of the innovation the team developed include: Security Configuration Healthcheck -- A robotic process automation (RPA) tool developed using UiPath to automate a detailed comparison of the security configuration settings on computer servers against a list of technical specifications. This test was typically performed manually in about 50 hours and can now be performed in approximately six hours. System User Access Testing -- A data extraction and analysis tool developed using Alteryx and Tableau to evaluate controls over access to our client's systems, including approval of user access privileges, periodic user revalidations and removal of access privileges for terminated employees. This test was typically performed manually in about 30 hours and can now be performed in just a few minutes. Engagement Status Tracking -- A data extraction, analysis and visualization tool developed using Alteryx and Tableau that extracts data from PwC systems (Connect and Aura) to prepare a detailed status tracker/dashboard to demonstrate engagement progress to both internal PwC engagement leadership and external client personnel. This task typically consumed about 30 hours per SOC engagement and can now be performed in approximately five hours per SOC engagement. Control Activity Comparison/Report Tie-out -- An automation developed in UiPath to compare control activities included in a detailed Risk and Controls Matrix (RCM) test plan to the final attestation report. This task was performed manually, taking about six hours and prone to human error, and now is executed error-free in about one hour. In addition, the DA team is actively looking ahead towards the future - for this current client and across the firm. The team has developed a pipeline of 40+ automation tools that are being deployed across the IBM large portfolio of 50+ SOC reporting engagements, as well as across the Assurance practice more broadly. The larger team intends to share them in the Digital Lab so that they can be applied throughout the broader Assurance practice. The DA team has even organized a two-day session to provide learnings in digital skills that they will instruct this month for approximately 100 core-Assurance/Risk Assurance staff on their engagement team to further encourage their individual digital journeys. The deployment of DAs on this engagement has yielded powerful results in the development of both the engagement team and numerous citizen-led innovations conceived on this project. Through their significant contributions, the DA team has helped place the firm in the enviable position of being the sole source provider of this work -- the client no longer engages a Big 4 peer who also performed similar work for the client in this space.

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use our technology tools and Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Your Tomorrow is driving quality, adding value and creating opportunities for our people to develop skills that make a difference, in and outside the firm. We sat down with two PwCers, Heather Meloy and Conor McManus, who are using new digital capabilities to solve important problems for their clients and their communities. How have you approached your digital upskilling journey? Heather: “I lead our giving program, and immediately saw opportunities to use data analytics and the firm’s new technology tools. By using visualizations and automations, I’ve been able to spend time on more meaningful work instead of just data management.” Conor: “The pace of change is increasing, and the firm is keeping up with Continuous Improvement and Your Tomorrow. By cutting unnecessary time and building my own skills , I feel like I’m working smarter and better. The benefits of automation are clear. Plus, it makes the job more interesting and less mundane.” How are you using your skills to deliver on our purpose and make a difference? Heather: “I am always looking for new ways to bring digital skills to my work on the Responsible Business Leadership team. For instance, we know our people are making charitable donations outside of our firm giving site and that it can be cumbersome to log them all, so I’m working on a bot that will read those receipts and automatically upload them. I’ve been able to automate much of our reporting to leadership and provide insights to continually make data-driven decisions when evaluating our programs.” Conor: “I have a client that is interested in introducing technology tools to take out manual effort. Our team has been able to talk to our client about their journey, and we have the right skills to review their work. We even had a Tax Senior Associate, Danny Engelman, who was able to go toe-to-toe with the client’s director on the technology. If we don’t learn now, we will fall behind our clients. Outside the firm, I also volunteer for the alumni board for my high school, and I noticed they had a ton of ugly data around donations. In my spare time, I signed up for free personal versions of the technology tools, used my new digital skills and put together a visualization for the board that depicts a summary of donations in one picture – by graduating class, average amount, etc. The data jumped off the page, helping them strategize their marketing. They were blown away by the presentation method. The president even said he would have paid for an output like this.” How do your teams play a role? Heather: “We are all excited and have encouraged each other to hone our skills. Everyone is stretched for time and has wide ranging tasks. To feasibly do it all, we need to learn how to automate. Plus, by creating workflows and solutions that we can hand off between each other, we eliminate the bottleneck of only one person knowing how to do something.” Conor: “On my team, we’ve been trying to implement as much as we can, balancing busy schedules. We have already had some easy, quick wins like cleaning up Excel reports automatically, and have been keeping a running list of solutions we want to build when time permits.” Any advice for other PwCers? Heather: “It is daunting to learn and understand new technologies and apply them to your work. But, no one is going to ask you to build a robot tomorrow. Take the first step by learning about the Essential Eight and some use cases. Just understanding what is possible is a great start.” (Click here to learn more about the essential eight.) Conor: “No one became an Excel pro in one day — take small steps. I started off by attending a Digital Academy, then bookmarked some other self-service trainings to complete as I could and talked to team members as well. It is like getting a new phone — the best way to figure it out is playing around with it.” Have you already earned 150 points in Digital Lab, fulfilling that portion of the Learn2earn challenge?

Now you are asking me to spend more time mapping just so I can use Mapper or Tax Adjustments? How will this save me time?” Re-Introducing: the Mapper Conversion utility. If you have previously mapped a client’s chart of accounts or trial balances to tax form lines, but you want to use Mapper or Tax Adjustments, you can use the Mapper Conversion utility to give yourself a head start. Mapper is able to convert mappings from the following tax form systems: Corptax and CTR/Onesource - The conversion utility will create the chart of accounts (including automating assigning the account type) and generate the account map. During the generation of the account map, Mapper will do a one to one comparison between the standard Corptax and CTR/Onesource accounts and map them to that corresponding account in Mapper. If you have created a user defined taxonomy in Corptax or CTR/Onesource, Mapper will run those accounts through its machine learning algorithm to map them to one of the standard taxonomies. Gosystem Bridge - The conversion utility will create the chart of accounts (including automating assigning of the account type) and generate the account map. Because the Gosystem Bridge does not have a standard taxonomy, Mapper will run all accounts through its machine learning algorithm to map them to a standard taxonomy. Check out the Mapper Release Notes to learn about all the features Mapper has to offer. Have an idea for new features? Submit your suggestions to the Mapper and Tax Adjustments Idea portal. More than 100 end-user ideas have already been implemented. How to get help Submit a ticket: Create a US IT Support Request through the Service Now hub.

I’m excited because all of us are learning new skills to help us in our careers and because we are investing in ourselves so we stay relevant as technology becomes more and more integral to everything we do. As you know, we’ve set an ambitious goal to have everyone complete four Digital Quests this fiscal year and in doing so, earn their Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30. Since all the Digital Quests became available three weeks ago, 12,000 of us have reached the goal and earned our badges! That’s exciting -- but we are going for 100%. As an added incentive to reach our goals early, and to have some fun along the way, we launched Learn2earn in January, right after the holiday break. To be part of Learn2Earn you need to do two things by April 30: Complete all four Digital Quests -- which are now available on the Digital Hub. Earn a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points. All eligible staff who complete these two asks by April 30 will have a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win! Team, what I often say is when we do the right things for our people and our clients, then our business will do well. And this year, as we focus on improving our skills and listening to our clients’ needs, we are tracking close to our goals -- but we need everyone contributing in the last quarter to reach our targets. With revenue of $12 billion so far, we’re slightly behind our goals for revenue and engagement margin (our measure of profitability). We’ve made tremendous progress this year but we need to stay focused on running our business well right through June. It’s going to take all of us doing our part to reach our revenue goals and manage the bottom line by spending wisely, using Global Delivery Centers and finding new ways to work smarter using technology. I’m looking forward to wrapping up the year and celebrating together. July Fourth will be here before we know it, and by then we’ll have new skills and a more digital firm, and a week-long break to relax and recharge. Thanks for keeping the momentum going for these last three months -- and please check out the updates from each of our lines of service and IFS so we all understand how we contribute to our success.

This can be an effective means of managing the Responsible Partner’s (as identified in CES) pre-approval obligations and can be extremely helpful in achieving compliance with firm policy. As background, many audit clients have a Pre-approval Framework Agreement in place, which is an approach used to obtain and document audit committee pre-approval for recurring or known (at the time of preparing the Framework) tax services to be provided to the client during the audit engagement period. For example, tax compliance and tax compliance related services provided annually and other types of detailed, pre-defined tax consulting services, may be included in a client’s Pre-Approval Framework Agreement to obtain Audit Committee pre-approval well in advance of actually engaging to provide the services. In these cases, the Framework AFS can be obtained after Audit Committee pre-approval is granted and should mirror the client’s Pre-approval Framework Agreement’s detailed scope of services for those pre-approved non-audit services. An approved Framework AFS will provide the necessary approvals to “clear the way” for engagement teams to be engaged to provide previously pre-approved tax services as requested by the client. However, care should be used to ensure that the non-audit services that are being provided clearly fall under the Framework AFS. In many cases, the Responsible Partner may still request that a separate AFS also be submitted as each project kicks off for notification/tracking purposes. If a separate AFS is requested, a best practice that should be considered is to also reference the Framework AFS at that time. Tax engagement teams should discuss with the respective Responsible Partner the procedures to be followed to obtain pre-approval for any non-audit services to be provided to their restricted clients and/or their affiliates, including whether a Pre-approval Framework Agreement has been agreed to with the client and the relevant PCAOB Rule 3524 communications have been made. If a Pre-approval Framework Agreement is not being used for your restricted client and/or their affiliate, consider having a discussion with the Responsible Partner regarding the use of a Pre-approval Framework Agreement approach.

Run a racing Grand Prix! The idea came to PwC Senior Manager Mark Diment and Manager Lizzie Tucker, members of the Private Company Services (PCS) Assurance Technology Team, when they attended the Alteryx Inspire conference in June and saw how they used a racing-themed competition to engage attendees. “It was fun, people really got into it,” said Mark, “and we knew we had to bring this back to PCS.” That’s how the idea hatched in PCS, to inspire Associates and Senior Associates to learn about Alteryx by participating in a PwC version of the Grand Prix. To participate, individuals earned a Ninja Green Belt by completing Learning Path 1 in the Path to Alteryx Ninja. Then they participated in a qualifying round to narrow the field down to the four finalists who would compete on stage in front of the Sector Conference audience of PCS Managers and Partners. No pressure! Who made it to the final round? Senior Associate Nozomu Hida (NY), Experienced Associate Na Li (Philadelphia), Experienced Associate Kevin Frank (Cincinnati), and Senior Associate Omar Moreno (San Antonio) representing PCS’ New York Metro, East, Midwest, and West regions, respectively. All were new to using Alteryx and just started learning the tool in July. On stage, under the bright lights and in front of a cheering crowd, they used Alteryx to devise solutions to trial balance and financial statement tie-out challenges. Nozomu crossed the finish line with the most points and took home the PCS Alteryx Grand Prix Champion title (along with other cool prizes). Having just downloaded and started to use Alteryx in the last few months, Nozomu commented: “Once you learn the basics, it gets easier and easier from there. It’s a very powerful tool.” Nozomu Hida (center), PCS Senior Associate from NY Metro and newly crowned PCS Alteryx Champion with Zac Perkins, Customer Success Manager from Alteryx (left) and Mark Flavell (right), PCS Assurance Transformation Leader.

It was also to honor military service members and veterans. To keep this challenge alive we ask you (and any others you'd like to include) to positively impact veterans by sharing our event on social media. The following are some suggestions when sharing the event: Include the video of our colleagues performing the pushups. (Please upload a copy of the video instead of sharing a link.) Include the hashtag #22PwC4Vets. Include the suicide prevention link: https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/ Challenge others (and possibly their companies) to the pushup challenge.

Suggested non-profits: My Warrior's Place, DoD Warrior Games, USO, American Legion, VFW, American Victory Ship, and MacDill Air Force Base. No matter how you choose to share the matter, please do something to support veterans throughout your local community. The more we do, the more awareness we bring, and the more we can make an impact.

Trying to process such tragic news was extremely difficult. “I received the news nobody ever wants to hear,” Colin reflected. “The diagnosis in September 2017 left us with two options: Become another sad statistic, or battle cancer and live every moment to the fullest. We chose the latter.” Colin shared the information with his colleagues and was overwhelmed by their support. “I am fortunate to work at PwC,” he said. “My partners and team provided the flexibility I needed to attend GJ’s radiation treatments and doctor visits. The firm always put my family’s needs first.” Colin also credits Be well, work well for helping him get through this difficult journey. “My brother’s situation began to take a toll on my energy,” Colin said. “In order to provide GJ the best support possible, I had to take care of myself, as well. I reviewed many of the firm’s Be well, work well assets, and based on some suggestions, I got into hot yoga and trained for the NYC marathon. It helped keep my mind sharp and spirits up.” Colin’s training paid off: He ran in the 2018 NYC marathon. The brothers recently hiked the Grand Canyon, and GJ returned to work full-time. Then in December, a routine scan revealed a recurrence of GJ’s tumor, requiring emergency surgery. Still, the family soldiers on and continues to support GJ and work to raise awareness. “We live scan to scan,” Colin said, “but we’re enjoying every moment possible and defying the odds. Our refusal to become another statistic has inspired others as well.” Colin’s family established StacheStrong, a 501(c)3 Not-for-Profit charity, to raise funds for brain cancer research. Since its launch 10 months ago, they have raised over $65,000 and gained some celebrity notoriety. They were invited to a taping of The View to meet the cast and they joined former Vice President Joe Biden at the annual Biden Cancer Summit in Washington, DC. A documentary on the StacheStrong story was just released by Road ID. If you wish to contribute to StacheStrong, please visit PwC’s Impact Space. We wish GJ and his family all the best in his battle. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: Talk with your teams about your well-being and flexibility needs, even during busy times. You don’t get it if you don’t plan for it, so hold one another accountable! Our Flexibility2 and Be well, work well sites provide tips and best practices.

We’ve got a bot for that (and 2 ways to earn with One-click hoteling? We’ve got a bot for that (and 2 ways to earn with Digital Lab) HQ News Feb. 7, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Commute, coffee, hotel into desk — all steps to starting your day. Save time in your routine by hoteling in one click with the Hoteling Reservation Automation from Digital Lab. The bot opens the hoteling portal and navigates through the screens to log you into the last desk you used. It also makes future reservations for the same desk. We talked to the team — Caleb Scott, Christian Engel, Eileen O'Neill, Jason King and John Scott — to learn more about the Hoteling Reservation Automation. PwC Inside: How did you come up with the idea for the Hoteling Reservation Automation? Jason: Hoteling is a unique routine for all PwCers, and is part of our strategy. Because this is part of our people’s daily lives, it was no surprise that three separate groups across the firm were already working on trying to automate it at the same time. All of our teams had gotten to the same place but took a different approach. And via the Digital Lab launch, we were able to combine them all for a far better product together. John: With Digital Lab, we’ve been able to meet and work with different people from across the firm and get the automation in front of everyone. And with the Digital Lab team reviews, we were able to add new functionality. What has the feedback been? Christian: When Digital Lab launched firmwide, the bot crashed for many at first and did not have great reviews from people using it. We learned about the bugs from user reviews and needed to make some fixes. Since then, we’ve been getting five-star reviews and are one of the top-downloaded assets. The Digital Lab platform allows us to follow up directly with people about their experience, which has been great. Jason: I think the thing people like most about this bot is that you can run it while you’re doing other things. It’s flexible and doesn’t take over your whole screen like some bots can. Eileen: We value the comments people make so much, because it allows us to add features, improve and iterate. John: For example, one of our big new features is adding out-of-office days, so you can skip reservations those days. We’ve also been asked to think about how the bot can help us make sure we cancel reservations when we don’t need them to free up space for others. We’re increasing the robustness and fixing regular issues as they come up. Were there challenges? Caleb: Because we were bringing together three different groups and their ideas, we had upfront challenges with picking what functionality worked best. And since not everyone has the same pattern of in-office days and the technologies we use vary, we had to do a lot of testing on different computers with different screen resolution, trying to make it work for everyone across the firm. Have you submitted anything else to Digital Lab? Jason: I have worked on a sales tax-specific automation and some other Tax functional assets with Digital Accelerators and Tax teams. We’re always looking for opportunities to submit to Digital Lab. There is so much to learn from on the site as well — trying new visualizations and the styles people use. Caleb: I also like to download other assets just to see how the builders go about certain things. As more of the firm starts using it, the assets become more dynamic. There are samples and templates that anyone can use, no matter your role -- not just one-off LoS-specific solutions. Jason: There are so many resources on Digital Lab. For any Tax form, there is probably a solution to make it easier on there. Even if you don't have something in mind to fix, the community gives you ideas for saving time and making improvements -- downloading or making your own. Do you know how you will use your Digital Lab rewards? Christian: No one is going to say no to extra rewards, but honestly for me, seeing it on the leaderboard and using it everyday myself is the reward. I love the competition piece of Digital Lab and the challenge to make it better. Eileen: It is a great addition to your bank account, but you can also see the firm investment in upskilling paying off. I had a call the other day to use the bot as a presentation demo, and seeing it used as a model was a big reward. Anything else you’d like to add? We would also like to acknowledge the important role our colleague, Matt Mancuso (NE Tax DA), had in this project. Matt found his true passion in the Digital Accelerator program and quickly became adept at creating bots such as this. Matt passed away in November 2018 and is deeply missed. He was an alum of Wake Forest University, and a scholarship in his name has been established by his family and PwC. More details on the scholarship and how to donate are here. Have you already earned 150 points in Digital Lab, fulfilling that portion of the Learn2earn challenge? Check out your points on Digital Lab (look in the top right of the home page), and read on for info on a great bot that will help you with a daily task. You’ll also earn points when you first download it. Click here for more guidance around points, and visit the Digital Hub to continue your digital upskilling journey.

The forces of change are widening the gap between those who have opportunities and those who do not. As a purpose-led, values-driven organization, we have the ability — and responsibility — to “mind the gap.” Serving on a nonprofit board is one way you can contribute. It gives you the opportunity to sharpen your digital and leadership skills, help an organization you’re passionate about deliver on its mission, and offer tech-driven solutions to some of society's greatest challenges. So, what exactly does it mean to join a nonprofit board? How can you be an effective board member? We address these questions and more in six training videos. You don’t have to be a partner or director to serve on a nonprofit board — nonprofits often seek professionals at all levels, and they benefit from generational diversity. Making a difference Check out what a few of your colleagues have been up to: For New York senior manager Amma Osei, serving on the board of Oliver Scholars is a way to contribute her unique perspective and professional experience, and serve as a voice for underrepresented students. Cleveland manager Kimberly Heinendeveloped a deeper understanding of some of the challenges our clients are facing through her work as Board Treasurer for She’s the First. For Chicago senior associate Alex Kapustka, working with Chicago Commons was an opportunity to step up as a leader. Amma, Kimberly and Alex are each receiving a $100 credit in Impact Space as a thank you for sharing their stories. Have a story to share? To be considered for future articles, please visit Impact Space and tell us how you mind the gap. Charging your time All nonprofit board service time should be charged to the appropriate WBS code.

Throughout FY19, we’re sharing Real-time recognition tips. In this article, we focus on what to recognize. We all know the value of recognition -- it drives engagement and increases productivity, boosts morale and builds relationships. With our tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool, we’ve made it easy for you to drive our recognition culture and make gratitude part of every day. But do you ever wonder what, exactly, you should be recognizing? If so, ask yourself the following questions: Is the behavior something you’d like to see the person do more often? If you see something great that you want the person to keep doing, recognize it in the moment -- recognition and reward are the purest and most powerful forms of positive feedback. Is the action something you’d like to see others doing? When you see a colleague doing something you want others to emulate, show appreciation for it right away. You can also use the Recognition activity feed to congratulate others on what you value most. Does it embody our firm’s values? When you see behavior that aligns with our values, call it out to show the recipient and your team what that looks like. Did it make your life easier? This may seem personal, but so is recognition. When a colleague is thoughtful and makes a big impact because they gave you their time, attention or energy, make sure they know it’s appreciated. More info: Healthy Habits: You can add “Appreciate Others” to your Healthy Habits in Virgin Pulse. Find it under the Emotional dimension in Managing Emotions, and add it to your Healthy Habits for daily tracking. Budget holders: The second spend period started Jan. 17; if you’re a budget holder, half of your annual budget has been added to the system (you will see your available balance during the recognition process on your PC). $25 award: Based on your feedback, we’ve added the option to recognize staff in the US with a $25 award. If you recognize staff in other territories, they will receive the same award level at a value in their home-country denomination. Relationship Leaders: You can see whether your assignees have been recognized by clicking the “My team” link on the Recognition home page. Keep an eye out for future installments of our tips series.

In short, we’ve refreshed and simplified how we use our brand, while making it easier to work with all the elements, particularly in today’s mobile-first, digital environment. And bonus — because we’ve kept all the core visual elements of our brand (same logo, fonts, color palette, etc.), there’s no need to change anything you’ve created in the past. Similarly, Strategy&amp; has refreshed its look. The team is also evolving its core message to differentiate the Strategy&amp; business even further, and building a brand story focused on strategy, made real – creating strategies that are built to deliver results and value for our clients, right from the start. How can I get my hands on the latest? Our US Creative Team and the Document Development Center (DDC) are already delivering new requests in the updated templates, and the DDC is a great resource to help update existing materials. You can also feel free to use the new Global Google Slides templates (or access through Chrome Managed bookmarks &gt; G Suite Apps &gt; PwC Templates) — scroll down to access the PwC US versions, which have the correct disclaimer language already in place. And easy-to-grab graphic elements have been added to the “Global” section. US IT is deploying the new Microsoft PowerPoint templates firmwide throughout February.

This will help our clients more easily get the content they want from us, when they want it and how they want it (by industry, service offering and other topics). Register using a personal email address if you’d like to experience it yourself. Along with providing a better, more digital experience for our clients, the preference center provides us better data and insights about what’s resonating in the market. We will also regularly reach out via email campaigns to clients and contacts, asking them to share their latest interests -- helping us do a better job of delivering the right PwC points of view, at the right time. And most importantly, the digital preference center allows a user to provide marketing consent, playing an essential role in our continued compliance with privacy regulations such as the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). How can your clients benefit? Know what your clients and contacts are receiving from us -- and help improve the relevance of the content we deliver digitally. Salesforce users can easily see which marketing publications their contacts already receive (and which events/webcasts they registered to attend). Remember -- not all of our database contacts are in Salesforce, but you can contact your local Geo marketer for a view of the contacts in our Eloqua (marketing automation) tool. Encourage your clients to sign up. Send this draft email to your key contacts, reinforcing the messages they'll be receiving from us to use the Preference Center to indicate the services, industries and topics of interest to them. Our policy is that we do not add clients to our mailings without the client taking action. The preference center and the new Social Central by Dynamic Signal are just two of the ways we’re using technology to improve how clients discover and interact with PwC content across a variety of channels. Get more info on the preference center, or connect with a member of our Marketing team who can help you strategize around better engaging with your clients and contacts online.

Laura L’Abbe, a member of a Boston S4S project team, shares how they recently brought their new digital skills to fill gaps for Learning Prep School: After reading about S4S launching Phase I in Boston last year, I was drawn to the project offered with Learning Prep School (LPS) as an opportunity to use and grow my Digital Accelerator skills. I already had a personal connection with LPS after volunteering at the school on a few occasions, and I had a good working history with one of the school’s board members, who is also a PwC partner. And, after reading through the nonprofit’s challenge summary, I thought my background and skills would be of value to the project team. The nonprofit’s need With just under 200 students, LPS serves special needs students in grades three to 12. Their students have complex learning profiles, including dyslexia, expressive/receptive language issues, autism spectrum disorder and social communication disorder. Without LPS, many of these students would be left behind. LPS turned to PwC for support to develop a marketing plan, and recommendations on ways to better use the types of data they collect (or could be collecting). The passion of the LPS administration and staff for these students was clear from the beginning. It was nearly impossible to listen to the LPS team’s powerful anecdotes of student successes and milestones without getting caught up in their joy and excitement about the students’ accomplishments. One of the administrators was even brought to tears as they recounted a particularly emotional story. The PwC S4S team Enter the PwC team – collectively, we represented a variety of work backgrounds, lines of service and staff levels. Many of us had not worked on a marketing plan before, but we leveraged our firm networks to learn what we needed to develop a relevant and achievable plan for LPS. We assessed the school’s competitors, studied their website and made recommendations about ways they could focus on sharing the LPS story. We also used our digital skills to create sample data visualizations and discussed additional ways they might consider using similar techniques going forward. It was incredible to work with my fellow volunteers – learning new skills while making a difference in our community kept our energy level high. The outcome After completing the deliverables for LPS and presenting to their administrative team, they were very appreciative of our results and provided real-time feedback on our work. It was great to hear their reactions, which truly demonstrated how much value they saw in our project. And they are already thinking of ways to implement some of the feedback to contribute to the school’s mission and vision for the way forward. Want to get involved in S4S? Being able to put my skills to work for such an important cause and to see the impact was incredibly meaningful to me. Interested in participating in S4S?

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Lisa Acevedo, Senior Associate in External Communications, based out of the New York office. I’ve been with the firm for 30 years. What’s a typical day for you? It starts with scouring the news! I look for trending stories that would benefit from a PwC mention or align with a PwC platform. We then decide which opportunities to explore and work to “pitch” our PwC leaders to key reporters. Understanding the news cycle and building trusting relationships with reporters is a big part of my day, along with making sure we tap into channels like LinkedIn and Facebook to optimize PwC content and find ways to feature our people. How did your journey lead you to this role? An unstoppable desire to learn! I joined the firm as an Executive Assistant with the college recruiting team where I became immersed in everything from setting up interviews to travel coordination to welcome receptions. Then the opportunity came to join Global and US Marketing working on myKcurve and other portal projects. I loved learning about content marketing, website analytics and social media. What followed was a Senior Associate role on the Marketing &amp; Sales Creative team focusing on the PwC external website. In 2014, when a role opened up in Social Media -- now External Communications -- I was intrigued, although my first thought was, “I’m not even on Facebook!” But once again, my curiosity and desire to learn and grow took over and I love handling external media for Tax with yet another wonderful, supportive team. The one constant in my PwC career has been working with amazing teams and forging -- and maintaining -- great relationships. How does your team bring value to PwC? We’re responsible for external media relations and social media strategy, so we help drive visibility for the firm, our PwC leaders and subject matter experts in the market by pitching stories and creating campaigns that have a natural tie-in with the latest news. Finding ways to leverage PwC’s reports, surveys, initiatives and case studies is our passion, and how we help build PwC’s brand in the marketplace. Anyone who speaks to the press on behalf of the firm has to participate in media training, and we handle that, too. Training is one-on-one and we cover everything imaginable to make sure our people are comfortable before an interview of any kind, as well as put their best foot forward on social media. It’s very rewarding to get our leaders “camera ready” and help them shine! What might we be surprised to learn about you? My love affair with New York City! I live in Rockland County, New York, with my husband, three kids and our dog, but on weekends we love exploring NYC, which is only 20 minutes away. From Broadway shows to dinner at Carmine’s to street fairs to yoga and spin classes, I love everything the city has to offer. And I can’t forget a shout out to my favorite Mexican New York restaurant, Rosa Mexicano; if you go, don’t forget to order the tableside guacamole -- and maybe a margarita!

What do I mean by that? I mean that if we do the right things for our people and our clients, then strong results will follow. First and foremost, we’re investing in you through Your Tomorrow. Everywhere I travel I talk to teams who are making exciting progress on our citizen-led innovation and using our new tools and knowledge to change how we work. Your Tomorrow is good for each of us as we learn new skills AND it is good for our clients. We can help in the second half of the year by keeping the momentum going. As we talked about during the town hall in October – we want to change at scale. That means ALL of us completing the Digital Quests, using Digital Lab and looking at the work we do through the lens of Your Tomorrow to see how we can drive even more quality, value and efficiency. Plus, as you heard on Monday, our “Learn2earn” challenge gives us another reason to get excited and to be leaders of our digital change. The more time we invest, the more skilled we become! And because we’re doing the right things -- focusing on improving our skills and listening to our clients’ needs -- we’re seeing good financial results. Specifically from a firmwide perspective, our revenues of $7.3 billion are tracking slightly ahead of budget -- with all three lines of service focused on achieving their full-year revenue growth goals. In addition, our key measure of profitability -- engagement margin -- is also slightly ahead of budget. Our financial results tie directly to our ability to reward you and invest for the future. So please check out the updates from Maria Moats, Mohamed Kande, Roy Weathers and Jim Flanagan to understand how we each contribute to our success in the second half of the year by investing in ourselves and passionately serving our clients.

It represents just one of the ways we're digitizing our business with Your Tomorrow and using technology to simplify your work life. Since its initial release last summer, Phoenix has rolled out in phases to more than 5,500 engagement teams across our lines of service. If you’re not already using Phoenix to request and manage work with our Service Delivery Centers and Centers of Excellence, you will be very soon! Over the next few months, we’ll finish bringing our remaining Envoy users on to Phoenix. Read on for more about when and how Phoenix is coming to your part of the business, and what you can do to prepare. The latest release In the latest version of Phoenix, users have the ability to customize service delivery schedules, benefit from new reporting features powered by PwC’s data platform (the same technology that powers the “build” capabilities in Digital Lab) — and Phoenix will now pull Salesforce data to auto-populate Service Delivery Center requests (Advisory only). Check out the release notes for our April 3.0 release and our May 3.1 release for more details on the latest new features and visit our Phoenix site for QRCs, videos, FAQs and support. Phoenix has evolved from last summer’s version 1.0, and is getting better and better with each release. As Phoenix continues on its agile development journey, we’re getting great suggestions from our early adopters — which means we’re adding even more functionality into our product roadmap.

The event was The Atlantic’s Future of Work Conference, where our team talked to more than 400 business leaders about Your Tomorrow and Access Your Potential® (AYP). Watch the inspiring 10-minute conversation here. “Digital starts with people first,” Tim said. With help from Senior Associate Scott Grossnickle and Project Manager Patricia Miller, both Digital Accelerators, he explained how we’re investing in people both inside and outside the walls of PwC. “I didn’t come to PwC with a technical background, but I realized we could do more and add more value by learning these skills,” Scott said. He and Patricia shared their excitement with helping their colleagues, our clients and our firm innovate for the future. “As a business, we believe we have a responsibility to do our part in ensuring that tomorrow’s workforce is competitive and has the right skills for the jobs of the future,” Tim said, connecting our purpose and values to our commitment to upskilling. He explained how PwC worked with teachers in recent months to design a free version of our Digital Fitness Assessment (DFA) app to help them build their digital skills and show them how to share what they learn with their students. The DFA app, CODE-E the robot and other Access Your Potential materials are designed to engage students in actively practicing the types of skills that will be required for tomorrow’s in-demand jobs like coding, robotics and RPA, and performing data analysis. Now available to educators via the Apple App Store or Google Play, the Digital Fitness app will play a central role in helping AYP reach its goal to train 100,000 teachers and guidance counselors. Like the firm’s version, the DFA app starts with a self-assessment to help educators gauge where their digital skills stand. They’ll receive a score and personalized learning feed with recommended learning assets to help them grow their digital IQ. Share with teachers you know You can share the app with educators in your network by using this email template. Please refer to the DFA Application Overview for more details and registration instructions for educators. If educators encounter issues at registration, they should contact the DFA Support Desk (us_dfa_servicedesk@pwc.com) or at 1-800-337-1978. How to get involved in helping students through AYP To make Access Your Potential a success, all of us need to play a role in helping students, especially those from underserved communities, adapt to a rapidly changing world. The best part is that teaching others is a great way to strengthen your own skills. Visit Impact Space to find an AYP volunteer opportunity near you, or visit AYP to learn more.

The report explores how organizations can become better risk takers while navigating digital transformation. The study found that risk functions with greater digital fitness are more effective at helping their stakeholders become smarter risk takers, leading to the following benefits: Faster progress on their digital journey More confidence in taking risks consistent with their strategies More effective management of transformation-related risks More value from their digital investments than anticipated The study also found the most digitally-fit risk functions (a group that we’re calling the “Dynamics”) display these six habits: 1. Go all in on the organization’s digital plan 2. Upskill and inject new talent to move at the speed of the organization 3. Find the right fit for emerging technologies 4. Enable the organization to act on risks in real time 5. Actively engage decision makers of key digital initiatives 6. Collaborate and align to provide a consolidated view of risks In conjunction with the Risk in Review Study, we also released tailored insights in our 2019 State of the Internal Audit Profession and State of Compliance digital reports. All three studies tie back to PwC’s broader thought leadership on the 4IR, Workforce of the Future, and Trusted Tech.

For 11 years, PwC’s Tampa office has been hosting Camelot Youth Summits, a program dedicated to helping high school students in the foster care system prepare for the future. "Most are living in group homes,” explains Director Frank Spinelli, who co-leads the program along with Manager Valerie Lenegar. “But at 18 they ‘age out’ of the system and have to leave those homes. We try to help them learn the life skills they need to succeed when they’re on their own.” The event features guest panelists who were once foster children themselves. Advice ranges from writing resumes and polishing interview skills (a firm handshake is important -- so is eye contact!) to managing finances and becoming digitally fit. “The panelists share stories of how they were helped by the same advice when they were that age,” says Valerie. “There’s nothing like a peer to get you to listen. They tell the kids what to take seriously -- and why.” The program was such a success, that two years ago Senior Manager Gary Montoute and Senior Associate Maria Lohle decided to expand it by adding quarterly workshops in addition to the annual Youth Summit. “There were so many PwC volunteers who wanted to help these kids,” says Gary. “We saw a vital need to extend our impact, and ran with it.” The quarterly programs are highly interactive and take place at a local organization serving over 200 local foster homes. “We aim to give these kids a fighting chance,” says Marie. “And now there are even more opportunities throughout the year to show we care.” The impact has been powerful; students enjoy seeking familiar faces at the sessions and developing bonds of trust with volunteers. And the panelists, all alumni of the Youth Summit, come back year after year, with a clear message: “Here’s where we are now, with jobs and degrees. Even if you hit rock bottom and don’t know where to turn, we can tell you how to persevere; it gets better.” "Our volunteers are passionate about sharing their first-hand success stories and are living proof that this program can make a difference,” says Valerie. “The bottom line is that these kids need advocates,” says Frank. “We rejoice when we hear them say, ‘I listened to what you said and applied it to my life.’ That’s music to our ears.” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between July 1, 2018, and September 30, 2018, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including Section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include Section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Generally, the threshold amount for a Section 165 loss is $10 million in a single year for corporations and partnerships with only corporate partners and $2 million for all other partnerships, S corporations, and individuals. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual including via a partnership or S corporations) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transactions Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC Policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

This week I sent a letter to nearly 1,000 CEOs and business leaders, you can read it below. This is something I do several times a year. I think about the many conversations I have with business leaders -- and pull out the themes that I think they would find helpful. My letter this time looks at the future of work. What I see in my travels is what companies and employees expect from each other has changed. You probably won’t be surprised when I say that my letter includes many of the lessons I’ve learned by listening to all of you and from how we do things at PwC. Based on my client meetings, we have a lot to offer our clients by talking about the experiences we’re having at PwC every day. By sharing our insights we build our brand and we create opportunities to listen for the things that are important to them. I hope you find this helpful! Tim Ryan Here is my letter: The Future of Work As the year comes to a close, I want to share something I’ve been thinking about recently related to the future of work and how we as CEOs can inspire our employees as the nature of work continues to be disrupted. As always, I hope you find my insights useful. The Future of Work and the Changing Employer-Employee Relationship The debate about the future of work has largely focused on jobs -- what they will look like, the decline of good paying jobs for lower skilled workers, and how jobs will be impacted by AI and automation. However, there is a bigger conversation that is worth having: It’s about the changing relationship between employer and employee -- a relationship that is drastically different from what it was 30 years ago and one that must evolve to better match the shifting demands of today’s workforce and employer. From the 1950s to 1980s, the relationship between employers and employees provided workers job security and financial stability with generous benefits. It was a ticket to the middle class. In exchange, workers pledged their loyalty to one company, often spending their entire careers there. Employees were given the opportunity to move up, earning greater pay and securing their families’ futures and their own retirements. But this approach has become outdated for the type of economy and workforce we have today: Technology has created a new class of worker -- one who can work in an increasingly “on demand” way and often on their own terms. It’s also now much easier for people to change jobs with online recruiting tools, and likewise easier for employers to use these same tools to recruit replacements and find new talent. And while workplace flexibility may seem like a great improvement for some, it also has the potential to disrupt work-life balance. Taken all together, Americans’ attitudes toward work and the organizations they work for have changed. A 2017 Gallup survey of US workers found that employees were mainly indifferent about their jobs with only a third of people who were surveyed saying they felt engaged at work. Employers and employees don’t need each other in the same way we used to, which has inspired a fluid, opt-in attitude toward work for many, and less employer investment in the employee experience and benefits. While the relationship between employers and employees has changed, the things we fundamentally need from each other have largely stayed the same. Each side wants stability and security: Employers still want the stability and security of a consistent, productive workforce with the right set of skills; and employees want the stability and security of steady, liveable wages and a great place to work, where they feel comfortable to be their authentic selves and aspire to do and be more. Although our needs haven’t changed, the ways we meet them have. As business leaders, perhaps we should take the first step in re-focusing on a relationship that is not only mutually beneficial, but more importantly one that can once again inspire loyalty and trust in each other. The future of work will require a new set of tenets that meet the needs of today’s workforce. Here are a few thoughts I’ve had on things we can bring to the table: Purpose-driven, meaningful work that links employees’ jobs to larger societal issues and reminds them that their day-to-day activity is contributing to important progress in the world. Multidimensional growth opportunities that are not just linear and allow people to explore different skill sets and passion-points within the same company (in effect, employees should have opportunities to “have different careers” within the same organization). Benefits that accurately meet the demands of people today such as higher costs of child and elder care, chronic health issues, challenges to mental and emotional well-being, the crushing expense of student loans, etc. These benefits should also be modular to allow employees to choose what is most important to them and tailor them to their needs. Inspired leadership that is a living example of empathy for workers. Corporate leaders should foster a culture of mentorship and sponsorship, and an environment where every employee feels ‘looked out for’ regardless of background. This also includes a diverse C-suite that lives the values of the business and are visible, accessible leaders, and not just figureheads. An environment that embraces diversity and inclusion, and that is a safe place for people to be their authentic selves at work. Work-life integration is so common now that we can’t compartmentalize in the way we used to when work was a purely 9-to-5 gig. We each need to be able to talk about our lives and experiences and be met with empathy. This is something that I have thought about a lot relative to PwC. In fact, many of the recommendations that I’ve outlined are central to the employee initiatives that we’ve put into action. These include: digital upskilling for all our employees; emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being programs to help our employees recharge; and opportunities for our people to do purpose-driven work. Together a new employer-employee relationship can expand on what the old one did for decades, create shared prosperity, and hopefully build better and more meaningful work and lives for millions of Americans. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the topic. CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Finally, I would like to thank all of you who are a part of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion. Here are some of our most recent accomplishments and upcoming projects: In just 18 months, we’ve grown from 150 to over 550 CEOs of America’s largest companies. Together, we are working to improve diversity and inclusion in our workplaces. We now have over 450 best practices on our website for anyone to access. In November, we launched the Check Your Blind Spot Mobile Tour where our state-of-the-art bus is traveling around the country educating people on how to recognize and remove unconscious bias in their decision making process. The bus will be going to 100 locations and reaching 1 million people over the next year. We have launched the “I Act On” pledge where workers and students can make their own individual commitment to be more inclusive. Next month, we will once again convene over 200 CHROs and CDOs to create a community for them to share best practices for advancing D&amp;I. On December 7, we held a “Day of Understanding” where over 150 companies hosted discussions on D&amp;I issues and provided unconscious bias training to their employees. We are proud of our impact and welcome any of your organizations who are not part of CEO Action to join us. As always, thank you for your time and I wish you a happy and safe holiday season.

With Access Your PotentialⓇ, we’re taking that commitment to the next generation and making sure they are also equipped with the skills they need to succeed. A team from the Risk Assurance Advanced Risk and Compliance Analytics (ARCA) group in New York Metro took this idea and ran with it. The result: Creative Computing, a cohesive curriculum that teaches students how to code. The program is based in Scratch, a free and easy-to-use programming tool that allows students as young as 8 years old to create their own interactive stories, games and animations. The great thing about Scratch is it’s as easy as putting together Legos -- something we all most likely mastered at an early age. There’s no coding experience necessary, but you will probably learn a thing or two alongside the students. To explore bringing the Creative Computing lessons to a school near you, check out the materials here and contact the Responsible Business Leadership team for more information. Check out other opportunities to teach technology skills through Access Your Potential on Impact Space. Here’s more on how Creative Computing is rolling out across the firm: New York: The team that started it all has spent more than 300 hours in NYC classrooms teaching the 8-week program to hundreds of students in grades 4-7. Now it’s one of the tools in our Access Your Potential toolbox and is already being used in Philadelphia and Boston. This spring we’re rolling Creative Computing out to schools in Chicago and Charlotte as more PwCers get on board in their communities. Philadelphia: In Philadelphia, the ARCA team began teaching Creative Computing to KIPP students last year. The program was so popular that this year the team has had to add a second session, now reaching 40 students with 20 volunteers who rotate teaching duties each week. After the school had to turn away students from the program because they didn’t have enough computers for the sessions, the PwC Charitable Foundation stepped in with a grant. The school was able to purchase new equipment and give more KIPP Philadelphia students access to programs like these. Boston: A team in the Advanced Risk and Compliance Analytics group in Boston is now working with Josiah Quincy Elementary School to teach weekly creative computing lessons. The series is running from March to June, with about 20 volunteers rotating each week to help manage busy season work.

The CEO Action Check Your Blind Spots unconscious bias tour made a very visible stop at the 2019 NBA All-Star Weekend. Hundreds of fans visited, along with former NBA and WNBA players, PwC people, and clients. The event also created opportunities to raise awareness of unconscious bias well beyond those who visited the mobile tour. Southeast Market Managing Partner Crawford Pounds and NBA Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Oris Stuart spoke to the media about unconscious bias and CEO Action’s goal of bringing this message to 100 cities and 1 million people through this mobile tour. Click here for the two and a half minute television segment -- it’s worth watching! Giannis Antetokounmpo may have thrown down the dunk of the night, but hundreds of visitors to the Blind Spots mobile tour made their voices heard by taking the “I Act On” pledge -- which is something we can each do and share with our clients and teams, too. The "I Act On" pledge, led by CEO Action for Diversity &amp; InclusionTM, encourages individuals to pledge to check their unconscious biases, speak up for others and show up for all. We can commit to making a difference on diversity and inclusion and inspire others to join us by taking the pledge. Just some of the ways we can take action and learn more include listening to the Outsmarting Human Minds podcast, getting involved in our Inclusion Networks within PwC and continuing to have open conversations with others around us. Whether we’re talking to our clients or our friends, we can also share with pride what our firm is doing as a leader with CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion to drive real change in society.

That’s important -- and so is our absolute commitment to independence. As we tell our story in proposals, to clients or on social media, we must avoid the appearance that PwC may be promoting or endorsing any service, tool or product from an entity, except when we have an established joint business relationship with that entity. This is especially important because some of our vendors are also audit clients and are subject to independence restrictions. Generally, it’s best not to mention our clients, vendors or specific products or services by name. Here are some examples of what you should and shouldn’t do: In a proposal or client demonstration Do: “We’re excited to use cutting-edge visualizations to bring you more insights.” Don’t: “We’re excited to use Tableau [or other product name] to bring you more insights.” On social media Do: “Excited to be attending a PwC Digital Academy where I will learn cutting-edge skills in storytelling, data analysis, #visualization and #automation! #PwCIsGo” Don’t: “Excited to be attending a PwC Digital Academy where I will learn how to use Tableau, Alteryx and UiPath! #PwCIsGo” When you have questions Do: Ask questions and get assistance from the One Firm Risk Organization. Don’t: Go it alone. Protecting the PwC brand Our reputation for independence has been essential to our brand for 160+ years. Here are more quick tips on sharing our story while protecting our brand, relationships and, most importantly, independence: On an engagement or in a PwC solution, don’t specifically name the product or service being used. Instead, cite the nature of the product or service in a generic manner (e.g., “We will use a data analytics tool to prepare an analysis of state-by-state sales tax expenses.”). When performing demonstrations or training for restricted entities, do not use client-specific data, processes or systems, unless part of a formal engagement. Never post images on any public sites (including Tableau) of data visualizations or other content that contains PwC or client data Never mention client names, discuss matters of public policy, or share proprietary information or data that PwC would not want a competitor to know.

US Public Communications Policy Before you confirm your ability to speak, post on social media, or participate in a public forum or industry conference, refer to our US Public Communications Policy. You’ll find clear guidance on who, what, when and how to share our story.

I personally learned so much.” “The sessions left me with some great tools and techniques to grow as a leader, both in and out of the firm.” “The experience, especially the closing session, was completely inspirational!” The three-day, immersive event served this year as a highlight for the completely reimagined IFS milestone program. Expanded to include not just newly promoted managers, but also senior managers, directors and managing directors, the interactive program was designed to strategically nurture IFS professionals’ growth and development throughout their first year in a new leadership role, and beyond. The reimagined sessions at Limitless had at their core some common themes: Taking leadership to the next level, executing on our One Firm strategy with excellence, a focus on becoming infinite learners -- and making lasting relationships along the way. Digital upskilling opportunities were at every turn as participants got to try innovative techniques like rapid prototyping and design thinking and experimented with immersive simulation games. Throughout the event, IFS leaders offered encouragement with a clear message: IFS professionals drive tremendous value for PwC and are a critical part of driving the firm’s strategy.

Beginning today, we’re kicking off a series highlighting these success stories that we’re calling “Lab notes.” We hope their stories inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. Neither Justin Hopton or Scott Grossnickle joined PwC with tech backgrounds. But today, as Tax Digital Accelerators, they’re helping their teams and clients use digital tools to work smarter, create efficiencies and drive more powerful results for clients. Their motivation to elevate their digital IQ was sparked even before they became Digital Accelerators -- because they recognized problems, wanted to remove hours and pushed themselves to figure out how to address challenges in an innovative way. “Without having any prior knowledge on Tableau, I just dove right in and figured out how to create a visualization for a client,” said Justin. Learning the tool and building new skills helped him provide clients with added value and increased his visibility with more senior members of the team on the engagement within the first six months. Before long, Justin and Scott were teaching others how to adopt new technologies -- running training sessions and consulting with engagement teams who were looking to transform the way they work. Visualizing data with Tableau This internal consulting work led them to create one of the first visualizations they submitted to Digital Lab. Using Tableau, they captured the work and hours they put into their projects and the impact they made throughout the year -- all depicted with a powerful visualization. How did they do it? First, they got the work in progress (WIP) report and worked with their team to create WIP Analysis Visualization for Internal/PD Codes. This tool converts a raw WIP into Tableau format. It strips away excess formatting, fills out required fields, standardizes date formats and then cleanses the data to format properly for a Tableau visualization. The visualization enabled Scott and Justin to tell their story more effectively. “We were able to demonstrate how we spent our time, the efficiencies we created and how we cut hours out of the process,” said Scott. As a result, they were able to have more meaningful conversations with team members. Justin and Scott continue to drive change, contribute their automations and spread their passion for innovation. They encourage others to be open to the possibilities that come from using these self-service tools with Digital Lab -- and be a part of this technology-sharing revolution. Visit Digital Lab today, start consuming assets, contributing to what you have already created and thinking about new solutions you want to see. To learn more, sign up for a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion session (more information here) on Vantage today, and digitally upskill yourself through resources available on Digital Hub. Stay tuned for more Lab Notes stories on how Digital Lab continues to take shape at the firm. If you have a success story, we want to hear it!

Letting your network know how you are transforming your work, and PwC, with your new digital skills and capabilities is a great way to tell our digital story -- and showcase our brand. You can find our full social media policy here. Please remember to keep these things in mind before you hit the “share” button: As a general rule, we don’t mention our clients or vendors by name in social media posts. In order to avoid perceptions that PwC may be promoting or endorsing any one company, tool or product over another, keep your posts general without naming a particular brand. It’s also important to be mindful of overly negative commentary. Need some examples? ✘ Don’t: My hard work and digital learning are paying off — just crushed my presentation using a @Tableau visualization! #PwCIsGo ✔ Do: My hard work and digital learning are paying off — just crushed my presentation using my new #datavisualization skills! #PwCIsGo ✘ Don’t: Excited to be attending a PwC Digital Academy where I will learn how to use Tableau, Alteryx and UiPath! #PwCIsGo ✔ Do: Excited to be attending a PwC Digital Academy where I will learn cutting-edge skills in storytelling, data analysis, #visualization and #automation! #PwCIsGo ✘ Don’t: Ugh. How am I supposed to be an #infinitelearner when my UiPath bot won’t run? #PwCIsGo ✔ Do: Loved working through some challenging #automation examples on campus today — great to see #infinitelearning in action while building bots! #PwCIsGo Never post images of visualizations or other content that contains PwC or client data on any public (including Tableau) sites. Never share proprietary information or data that PwC would not want a competitor to know, mention client names or discuss matters of public policy. Many vendors (including Tableau and Alteryx) are also audit clients and are subject to independence restrictions. PwC must remain independent of SEC audit clients in accordance with SEC independence rules in both fact and appearance, including perceived joint business relationships. As such, PwC cannot, among other things, promote or endorse an SEC audit client’s software or influence a client's purchase of a license. Read the Business Relationships Independence guidance for information about permitted activities when interacting with SEC-restricted software providers. Remember to use the #PwCIsGo hashtag for all your Digital Upskilling posts! (When posting and tagging #PwCIsGo, always remember that you’re representing the firm.)

This program is another way PwC supports your physical well-being as part of Be well, work well, a key component of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Learn more about the program and register at hingehealth.com/pwc. I tried to visit a chiropractor every month, but my consulting lifestyle means I’m not able to make their office hours, sometimes for months in a row. I’m in airplanes for long periods of time, and the long seat time is also sometimes painful. Exercise regularity suffers due to the jumbled schedule and long hours. I love the “routine” that this program offers my otherwise chaotic schedule. I feel like I'm making progress and learning HOW to deal with my back pain. I changed my diet, walk more (in addition to running), and have lost some weight, which helps a lot with the back pain. Overall, having a program like this establishes the exercise and stretching habits and provides the knowledge that I know I will use from now on whenever I experience back pain. Thank you, Hinge Health!" If you’re interested in conquering your back or knee pain with Hinge Health’s free 12-week program, click here to apply. Hinge Health is available to PwC partners, staff and their family members age 18+ who are enrolled in a PwC UnitedHealthcare (UHC) medical plan and meet the participation criteria established by Hinge Health.

While I hope none of you has to face difficult or uncomfortable situations here at PwC, I also know that we’re working in a complex environment and no organization is perfect. That’s why I want to remind you that if it does happen, it’s important to speak up. If you’re concerned about a client matter, firm policy or a situation that makes you uncomfortable -- please talk to your coach, partner leader, Relationship Partner, the One Firm Risk Organization or the People Team (HR). You can also report your concerns to the Ethics HelpLine, anonymously if you prefer. Whether you have a concern about questionable time reporting (“eating time”), suspected misuse of client or PwC data, antitrust law questions, possible sexual harassment or another matter, the firm is here to help with the right policies and resources. Your concerns will be taken seriously and handled confidentially. Many of us have completed the Pressures &amp; Demands course -- and it’s now required for all of our people via My Compliance Dashboard. The training is important and the message is simple: We are a firm where the expectation is that everyone treats each other with respect -- and when we see a situation that isn’t right, we speak up. Tim Ryan Understanding what’s expected To refresh your memory on the firm's expectations that we report our concerns, take a look at PwC’s Code of Conduct and the Reporting Concerns policy in Our Standards.

The once very active, happy-go-lucky IT manager in Tampa faced the most difficult obstacle of her life. The disease began to redefine her physical abilities, but Valerie found the inner strength to cope -- and thanks to support from her PwC team and the firm’s flexibility, she was able to surpass even her wildest dreams. “Confronted with a sudden and mysterious disability, I worried about my economic future and ability to meet my responsibilities,” Valerie said. “What also weighed heavily on my mind was the fear I’d never cartwheel again. My older brother and hero taught me how to cartwheel when we were kids. The prospect of never being able to do the one thing that reminded me of him was scary.” With tremendous support from family, friends and the entire firm, Valerie was able to continue working, traveling -- and cartwheeling. But her path hasn’t been easy. At times, the simple act of standing up became almost impossible. “Myasthenia Gravis gradually made my life more difficult,” she explained. “It prevents my muscles from receiving the message my nerves are sending. So a single motion can take the energy of a hundred.” Major surgery in 2013 helped alleviate some of her physical ailments, but Valerie also credits the firm for helping her get through the tough times mentally and emotionally. “I don’t know what I would’ve done if the firm wasn’t so helpful,” she said. “When my mobility became limited, I was allowed to work from home. Mentally, I was in a battle to prove that I was still capable of being me and, in large part thanks to the firm, I won. During my weakest moments, my team provided support, never complaining about my situation or making me feel ‘less than.’ They always considered me for opportunities, even allowing me to take on a global role with sometimes heavy travel requirements.” Valerie hopes her story will inspire others who find themselves in similar life-altering predicaments. Her advice is to always have a goal to draw your focus beyond your immediate circumstances, and to recognize that you’re not alone. “People experience challenges all the time, and if they can persevere, so can you,” she said. “Regardless of your situation, it could always be worse. So appreciate each day and make the most of what you have.” Like a perfectly executed cartwheel, at one point Valerie found her life upside down. But it was only temporary. Today, Valerie is in remission and happily continues to cartwheel when she travels. Next up are Northern Ireland, Iceland and Denmark. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: Keep flexibility on the agenda for team conversations, even during busy times. You don’t get it if you don’t plan for it. Hold one another accountable to make flexibility happen. Create a plan and execute on it throughout the year. Our Flexibility2 Spark site provides tips and best practices you can leverage. Valerie credits her PwC family for being able to cartwheel on every continent.

On that day, I received an employment offer from PwC. Also on that day, I should have been driving back to Boston from graduation at Syracuse University after receiving my master’s degree. Instead, was attending my mother’s funeral. I won’t attempt to explain how or why the universe works in mysterious ways. Instead, I want to share how these three things came together in a meaningful way. Skills for Society Fast forward to the fall of 2017 when the firm announced a major initiative called Skills for Society -- a new approach to the way people at the firm would build skills and make an impact in the community. PwC would work with nonprofits on some of the biggest societal challenges and, in addition to solving these important problems, our people would grow and position themselves -- and the firm -- for the future. Boston, where I’m based, happened to be one of the first PwC cities to launch Skills for Society. In September 2018, everyone in our office received an invitation to apply for the program, which included a handful of projects for various nonprofits. I was particularly drawn to one nonprofit, the Easter Seals of Massachusetts, for two reasons. First, it happened to be an organization my mom had been deeply involved with. And second, the organization was seeking people who could help with a major rebranding initiative, including developing a social media strategy. Finally, a chance to put my master’s degree from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Relations to work! It was a perfect fit. I was fortunate to be selected for the program and assigned the role of project manager. Our team of five PwC professionals and a partner spent approximately 40 hours each, over the span of two months evaluating the nonprofit’s social media channels. We ended the engagement by presenting our plan and offering potential next steps to marketing leaders at the organization. Final thoughts Skills for Society lived up to its promise of building skills and making a positive impact on our community. I had the chance to reach my full potential, apply newly-acquired social media skills and build new project management skills. The experience also allowed me to provide hands-on consulting -- something I otherwise would never have had the opportunity to learn. How can you get involved? It’s easy. Skills for Society projects are currently available in five cities, including Boston. To get involved, complete this simple interests form. Learn more about Skills for Society here.

Nurture a culture that builds on people's strengths and promotes good mental health. For example: Avoid labeling people by their diagnosis. Learn the facts about mental health and share them with others, especially if you hear something that is untrue. Treat everyone with respect and dignity. Mental illnesses are brought on by a weakness of character. Research has shown that mental illnesses are a product of the interaction of biological, psychological and social factors. Influences, such as loss of a loved one or a job can also contribute to the development of various disorders. People with mental health needs, even those who have received effective treatment and have recovered, tend to be unproductive. Employers who have hired people with mental illnesses report good attendance and punctuality, as well as motivation, quality of work, and job tenure on par with or greater than other employers. Studies show no differences in productivity when people with mental illnesses are compared to other employees. Resources to help you with your mental well-being Managing triggers.

The implementation required that the data for the firm’s more than 55,000 partners and staff, each with as many as 20 levels of security access, had to be validated to ensure that people did not have access to information that they shouldn’t, which could put PwC at risk. To get started, Trevon, Guy and Justin met with the project stakeholders to understand the project requirements. Then they assessed their technology options and chose Alteryx as the best solution since they needed to blend multiple data sources. The next step was to review and cleanse their data sources, which included data from Workday and a mapping file from the HC systems team that identified exemptions. After that, the team blended the data and isolated Mexico and US populations before finally building formulas to create the Alteryx workflow. Ultimately, the team’s workflow saves eight hours every time it runs, or 200 hours per year, and has eliminated over 150 manual steps, helping to eliminate the possibility of human error in each. The workflow, Workday Security Role Audit, can now be found in Digital Lab. While it was created for the HR SSC, the team hopes that PwC groups working with clients that are implementing Workday will realize its value. Trevon, Guy and Justin see more opportunities to standardize and automate their work. “We’d like to continue to leverage our Digital Accelerator training, this time in intelligent process automation,” says Guy. “Building a bot that will pull files directly from Workday and run the Alteryx workflow would save even more time.” Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Trevon Adams, Guy Delvecchio and Justin Vandiver Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/34616.html</url><pwc_title>The top 5 things everybody’s talking about from the firmwide Town Hall</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:36:49</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>news-type:Firmwide|source:HQ News</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-11-02 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:HQ News</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>The top 5 things everybody’s talking about from the firmwide Town Hall The top 5 things everybody’s talking about from the firmwide Town Hall HQ News Nov. 2, 2018 In case you missed it, Tuesday’s firmwide Town Hall had a bit of everything -- from the exciting next steps for Your Tomorrow to stories of how we’re bringing our Digital Upskilling strategy, to life, to some exciting PowerUp! surprises. Read on for our favorite moments, and don’t forget to watch the replay to see what else people are talking about. This is a big year for Your Tomorrow. Tim shared the key messages from our recent Fall Partner meetings, the progress we’ve made delivering as One Firm and driving Continuous Improvement, and most significantly this year, how Citizen-led and Business-led innovation will drive our Your Tomorrow strategy. View the Your Tomorrow overview that Tim shared here. What really happens at fall partner meetings? We got the inside scoop. Tim shared the key strategy messages our partners heard and played a time-lapse video of the meetings., He also announced that we’d all get a flavor of what fall partner meetings are all about through our Strategy in Action video series, which highlights various topics showcased in booths at this year’s meetings. Watch the first three of our Strategy in Action videos here. Our Digital Upskilling journey is in full swing. Digital Talent Leader Sarah McEneaney was joined on stage by Robin Stein, Taniesha Robinson, Lindsey Luraschi and Caleb Hester, who each shared their Digital Upskilling stories. From pausing meetings at 2 p.m. ET on Tuesdays and Fridays to play PowerUp!, to becoming an in-demand Alteryx superstar in your office, there are many ways our panelists are leveling up their digital acumen -- and it’s easier than you might think. Those skills will be critical in completing the four Digital Quests that will earn them -- and all of us -- a Digital Acumen knowledge badge by the end of FY19 (June 30, 2019). Want to increase your own digital acumen? Start your journey by accessing our Digital Upskilling resources on the Digital Hubtoday! It pays to PowerUp! Our PowerUp! hostess-with-the-mostess Christine made a guest appearance to kick off the broadcast, then returned for a bonus team prize presentation for those teams that played PowerUp consistently throughout the six week challenge and had the highest average scores. While not everyone could take home the big prize, we did all get something pretty great: We found out that we’ll continue to play PowerUp! two times a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays at 2 p.m. ET! (And don't forget to check out the pre-reads on the Digital Hub. Note tomorrow's are under November 6.) You can add future games to your calendar with this link, and congratulations again to our winning teams: PowerUp Girls, Mind the GAAP, Kjar's Champs, Walk With Elias, Ron's team and the ASMT DA team. We’ve got so much to look forward to before the New Year! With the launch of Digital Quests, Digital Lab and continuing our Be well, work well efforts through 50,000 Random Acts of Kindness, we’re heading into the last half of the fiscal year with a lot to be excited about. The first Digital Quest will launch next week -- Sarah challenged each of us to complete it before 2018 comes to a close. And you can use all the skills you learn to get the most of Digital Lab when it launches Nov. 13 (to get a preview of the experience, watch the Digital Lab video Robin shared here).

On Friday, Nov. 2, more than 40 PwC partners and staff in Boston participated in a ScopeAthon - a Skills for Society half-day skills-based volunteering event with 10 local nonprofit organizations. Skills for Society is a new approach to the way we build skills and make an impact in our communities through Your Tomorrow. In phase one of the program available in five cities, we’re putting our digital and professional capabilities to work with nonprofits on some of the biggest societal challenges we face today, so we can make a difference while continuing to grow and develop. The ScopeAthon event matched three to four PwC professionals with a nonprofit to diagnose a pressing challenge, and build an actionable roadmap to tackle it. Our people were energized to use their professional skills to help nonprofits address areas ranging from customer relationship management to marketing strategy. The day began with a brief training session from Skills for Society collaborator, the Taproot Foundation, on uncovering the root cause of a challenge and identifying a high-impact, feasible solution. Nonprofit teams left the event with clearer paths forward on how to implement a solution on their own or through additional support from Skills for Society. This ScopeAthon provided our people the opportunity to use their skills, expand their networks and make an impact with organizations doing important work in our communities. Here’s what a few participants had to say below. Associate Savhanna Soucy: “The ScopeAthon was an awesome opportunity to step out of client work for half a day to use the skills I've developed at PwC in a new way. Our PwC team was xLoS and xCompetency so our different experiences added a unique perspective to the nonprofit's problem which helped us provide them with holistic software selection criteria, a high level roadmap and a volunteer lifecycle review.” Partner Tara Aliotta: “The [nonprofit was] so impressed with how we collaborated with them and teased out the reason for the pain point as opposed to the result of the pain point. I only feel like we scratched the surface!” How can you get involved? It’s easy. Skills for Society projects are currently available in five cities, including Boston.

Start a Chain Reaction. Advisory May 6, 2019 Optimizing supply chains to meet modern customer demands takes more than selecting technology and functional excellence. It requires transformation and integration across enterprise operations. PwC's Connected Supply Chain Integrated Solution helps our clients design and implement a digital, intelligent, fully transparent, end-to end and interconnected supply chain that optimizes for speed, risk and profit. See how by visiting our newly launched website. What is the Connected Supply Chain Integrated Solution? Companies are leveraging significant advances in automation, machine learning, robotics, AI, and other digital capabilities to deliver on the promise of an agile supply chain, often in ways that were unthinkable only a few years ago. External triggers that previously were considered impossible to plan for can now be anticipated and addressed in real time. For example an unexpected demand spike after a celebrity endorsement, a snowstorm that disrupts the inflow of parts from suppliers, or an expected heat wave that could lead to an increase in demand for sports drinks. The connected supply chain can monitor social networks, weather forecasts, and numerous other data sources and automatically optimize the supply chain. With the onslaught of emerging technologies and sharp increases in expectations of consumers, customers and employees, deciding where to invest is becoming ever more difficult, and more pressing. Our solution helps clients navigate through the complexity and take advantage of digitization to help build a truly “Connected Supply Chain” that is Fit for Growth and ready to meet the needs of the connected digital age. We help clients transform through an agile approach that enables them to make small improvements that can be built upon to maximize for the future -- becoming smarter, more agile and adaptive. By leveraging our integrated, technology-enabled solution, which relies on our strong alliance partner collaboration model, our clients can envision how they can transform their supply chain into an intelligent, digital ecosystem. PwC has proprietary technology to accelerate project delivery and drive deeper insights. Supply Chain Opportunity and Optimization Platform (SCOOP) is PwC’s supply chain analytics platform which provides rapid insight into supply chain performance by diagnosing performance issues and opportunities. Using advanced analytics – including machine learning, simulation and optimization – it accelerates how our clients can access and build capability in advanced supply chain analytics.

Which motivates you? What if we had a program that drove all three at once? Skills for Society, introduced by Tim Ryan last fall as a key element of Your Tomorrow, does just that. Tampa ESC’s people are helping lead the way by recently completing the first pilot program. Skills for Society creates a pathway to help you: Build your network Help nonprofits address their biggest challenges Develop your digital, professional and leadership skills In the first project, our Tampa ESC team of 250 used Alteryx, Tableau and other data and analytics skills to help DonorsChoose.org, a nonprofit that has funded more than 1 million youth education projects nationwide, better understand its data. The ultimate goal: helping teachers stock their classrooms. For DonorsChoose.org, our team provided valuable insights to help use their limited resources more effectively. And on our side, the accomplishments included helping our people learn a new technology platform, develop their digital skills and work with new colleagues. Here’s what a few participants had to say about the experience: Director Mitzi Minor: "This was an exciting, win-win project to be a part of, as it allowed us to help a nonprofit in need while enhancing our digital aptitude. My mom and sister-in-law are both public school teachers, so I've seen firsthand how educators struggle to equip their classrooms with the supplies they need. I was thrilled to learn that PwC was connecting us with DonorsChoose.org, knowing we were contributing to an organization that funds classrooms (and benefits teachers like my mom and sister-in-law) made my efforts even more rewarding and meaningful!" Manager Marjorie Schmit: “Being part of Skills for Society was such an enriching opportunity to learn new skills, build relationships and give back to the community! I was impressed with the level of collaboration of my team where each team member shared their respective skills as we built our Alteryx workflows and Tableau reports. I was most amazed by the interest from DonorsChoose.org in our recommendations for improvements to their teacher request experience.” Senior Associate Luanne Thorpe: “I had previously downloaded Alteryx and watched self-study training, so having a real-world data set to work with has shortened my learning curve.

Anything as a Service (XaaS) Integrated Solution for the win! Advisory Feb. 20, 2019 Client problem Thoma Bravo, a leading private equity firm with over $30 billion under management, is on a mission to acquire and transform software companies on an accelerated pace. Portfolio software companies typically get goals of transitioning to subscription/software-as-a service (SaaS) business models, and increasing business velocity while optimizing operating costs and investments in enabling technologies. One of these companies, Qlik—a provider of data management and analytics platform services— faced declining sales productivity along with mounting market pressure to launch its subscription/SaaS business, and had aborted a previous effort due to business readiness challenges. PwC was brought in to provide an actionable approach to quickly break the Q2C operations logjam and enable Qlik’s rapid transition from on-premises to SaaS. Qlik jumped onboard when we showed them an actionable path toward SaaS. We created a Magic Moment... Qlik’s leadership knew they had to move to a subscription/SaaS business model, but there were too many legacy processes, ambiguous sales and customer engagement along with the burden of historical technology investments. PwC’s Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) Integrated Solutionprovided leading practices to help Qlik imagine the “art of the possible.” We showed them that to function at “cloud speed,” they needed to update certain processes so they can move faster and with fewer bottlenecks. We captured their issues on a visual heat map and quickly developed hypotheses for the necessary operational initiatives. We worked with Qlik to prioritize key initiatives and develop 30-, 60-, and 90-day action plans for people, processes, and technology. Qlik was thrilled with how quickly we were able to put together practical, real-world action plans and so was Thoma Bravo. Before the SaaS transformation was complete, Thoma Bravo engaged PwC in an XaaS transformation for Apttus—another one of their portfolio companies. We delighted Thoma Bravo by accelerating Qlik’s transformation in a mere 14 weeks. The solution and value we brought It seemed impossible at first, but we understood that a speedy transformation would set the stage for a successful launch of the new sales experience. We leveraged our XaaS integrated solution IP to run a hypotheses-based engagement focusing on target state design and accelerated implementation. Two key initiatives were prioritized based on projected business impact - Segmented Transaction Flows (1-touch/ high-touch) and Strategic Deals Desk. This cleared the path for the sales team to configure, price, and quote their own orders (1-touch transactions) by developing clear thresholds and guidelines for straight-through/auto approval of quotes. These policies for auto-approval were based on streamlining and simplifying order elements like: offerings available pricing and discounting thresholds length of contract terms billing frequency It used to take days to create and approve quotes. Now, within four weeks of their subscription/SaaS solution going live, Qlik has transformed this to where over 80 percent of quotes are created in under 10 minutes, and more than 85 percent of quotes have been approved automatically, speeding up the process even more. This was achieved by working with Qlik’s leadership team to develop the ideal customer and sales experience leveraging XaaS process and capability frameworks along with industry leading practices, and aligning on minimum viable operations by BXT together with leadership. "This transformation will drive more sales growth, dramatically lower the cost of transactions and improve the morale of the organization. I look at my “1-touch” transaction dashboard every day, and it’s already showing me how well this transformation has been going. This program is a success."

I’m humbled by the thoughtful notes I receive with perspectives on all sides of the issues happening around us. From time to time, I’m going to share some of these thoughts -- not necessarily with names and details -- but to share ideas to help us understand and be good colleagues to each other. A couple of weeks ago one of our Muslim colleagues wrote to me reflecting on the shooting in New Zealand and the month of Ramadan. From May 5 to June 4, some of our people may be fasting from dawn to sunset in observance of Ramadan. This is an opportunity for us to get to know each other in another way and be respectful of our colleagues. Also, as a reminder for all, most of our offices have Serenity Rooms that provide private space for reflection, prayer, meditation, or respite. These rooms are available to us for these uses -- on this holiday or others. While I’m honored to hear from so many of you, I know I can’t address every event or day that is significant to some of us. What I hope is that we’ll continue to get better at talking about what’s important for each of us. Having these conversations one-on-one or in our teams lets others know how they can support you and how you can support them in return.

Last week, the Pittsburgh and Cleveland offices participated in our MindFuel sessions sponsored by the Great Place to Work committees. The 90 minute sessions were led by coaches from the Leadership Coaching Center of Excellence and focused on mindfulness, the science behind meditation as well as a few meditation techniques. Participants in Cleveland wear Muse Headsets which uses EKG technology to track brain waves during meditation. “As a result of MindFuel sessions, I have a fuller understanding of the long-term benefits from meditating. I have used the Calm app every day since the training and have made it my goal to start taking care of my brain as much as I do the rest of my muscles. Being more present and aware of our surroundings is extremely important in today's world and we can all use time to take a break and refresh our minds.” - Amanda Griffith, Assurance Senior Associate - Cleveland Pittsburgh participants learn about mindfulness and meditation! “I learned that our brains can't process more than one cognitive task at a time, which will change my approach to work. From the breathing exercises paired with the different thought scenarios, I took away which ones would give me energy vs which ones would calm me, providing a benefit not just for the workday but for better sleep and a clear mindset. I really enjoyed the session - thank you!” - Lisa Fletcher, Assurance Associate - Pittsburgh Stay tuned for more MindFuel sessions in the Midwest Market!

The goal was to identify key words and phrases to help group and service similar reported incidents, and provide valuable insights and visualizations on these submissions to identify potential areas for improvement. Before moving forward with a vendor, they asked John Heinen, senior manager in IFS, to use his skills as a Digital Accelerator and data scientist to assess a report that one vendor was able to produce prior to engaging the third party. “Because of the training I received in the Data Analytics track of the Digital Accelerator program, I knew I could make a better report,” said John. In only three days — after leveraging Jupyter notebooks on NLP in Digital Lab and using his newly acquired Tableau skills — John developed a visualization that not only surpassed the vendor’s, he also helped the firm avoid spending $427,000 by using PwC resources in Digital Lab to build, host and run the report instead of using a lower-quality third party solution. After his report was selected, John explored the capabilities of Workbench in Digital Lab to share his visualizations with others. “The capabilities of Workbench are amazing,” he said. “You can easily generate a URL to a very polished and professional-looking visualization from a report in Tableau or Power BI and send it to someone with no access or prior knowledge of those technologies and they can understand it.” In addition to helping our finance team, work is already underway to scale John’s report to other areas of our business that use PwC’s Service Hub as a support function, starting first with our IT and payroll teams. And John is thrilled with the results. “This experience is what I dreamt about when I joined liftoff in October,” he said. “I’ve been with the firm for almost 20 years and right now is truly an unprecedented time to be at PwC. The Digital Accelerator program has been a life-changing experience — it’s what we all need to stay successful.” In addition to being one half of PwC’s only husband and wife Digital Accelerator duo — his wife Amanda Heinen, senior manager in IFS, attended liftoff in July — John was also recently profiled in a Huffington Post blog from Shannon Schuyler, Chief Purpose Officer, entitled “This Is What Happens When You Find Meaning In Your Work.” Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Karen Pasawicz, Scott Hamrick, John Heinen Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/36291.html</url><pwc_title>Lab notes: Ordering team meals stressing you out?

Digital Lab has a bo Lab notes: Ordering team meals stressing you out? Digital Lab has a bot for that HQ News Jan. 7, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. This “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope their stories inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. We’ve all been there -- a looming deadline, a late night, stomachs rumbling and the debate over which restaurant to order from seems endless. After team suggestions, Tax Senior Associate and Digital Accelerator Jordan Sandona set out to eliminate the stress of organizing a group dinner order. She created her first bot and shared it through Digital Lab -- and it’s now saving time for teams across the firm. (Note: See our travel and expense reimbursement policies for details on meal expenses.) We talked to Jordan to learn more about her team's Dinner Bot. The original users of the Dinner Bot (left to right): Jordan Sandona, Becky Mayo, Ellie Rauch, Eric McAuliffe, Bill Callan, Brittany Ruth, Jason Krentz, and Rachael Oxton PwC Inside: How did the team come up with the idea for the Dinner Bot? Jordan: It was actually my practice bot for UiPath training. I was working with a Core Tax provisions group in Milwaukee as a Digital Accelerator, asking them about their pain points and where time could be saved. The team made a joke about ordering dinner and it stuck with me. It can take an associate an hour every night to talk to the team, choose a restaurant and place an order. Even though it isn’t client-related, technology can help save time on this administrative task, giving back time for client-billable work. With the bot, you build a list of potential restaurants in your area that the bot will then randomly select from in seconds, making the painful process more like a game. Overall, it was a great experience to learn and get upskilled. And now, I am upskilled on the technology when the opportunity comes up to create bots to help out clients. What has the feedback been? When I first created the bot and the client team started using it, colleagues in my office talked about it, so I was encouraged to upload it to Digital Lab. Since then, people from every market have told me they will use it! I appreciate it so much, since we really didn’t expect a response. It was just my practice bot for an administrative task, but it addresses a universal pain point and gives teams time back. Were there challenges to getting the bot working? Since this was my first time using UiPath, I had an initial upskilling challenge. I did a lot of searching on my own. Then, when it was uploaded to Digital Lab, with so many more people using it, it wouldn’t work with bot runner. But through the user feedback and help on the site, including ideas from Digital Lab reviewer Spencer Miner, we’ve fixed the issues and introduced new improvements, so it’s even smoother to run. Have you submitted anything else to Digital Lab? I’ve been part of two client-related automation submissions. The first is a team project to help review Schedule K-1 tax forms for partnerships. The bot will save at least 200+ hours -- or half the time it used to take for us to review these for one client -- and should be able to be leveraged for any client. And the latest is a fixed asset report automation. I’ve also found a lot of cool automations that I use frequently. You never know what you are going to find that can help you, so I check out Digital Lab regularly. Do you know how you will use your Digital Lab rewards yet? I’m not sure -- but more than the rewards, I’m happy we can help teams. Choosing a place to order food is the last thing you want to be spending your time on. I hope the bot gives a few minutes back to everyone’s lives, and that it might help get them home a few minutes earlier.

And, for our audit clients, Salesforce helps us manage client relationships. We communicate better across our teams, save time, run our business well and deliver a better One Firm client experience. Tim asked Salesforce users to concentrate on these three actions during Monday’s webcast for Managers, Directors and MDs (which he’s also shared with partners), to help us get even more out of Salesforce. Chatter more. Use Chatter to collaborate more quickly on pursuits and refer to messages in a central location. @Mentioning key team members, particularly on xTerritory pursuits, keeps everyone aligned and reduces the need for internal emails and calls. Include contacts on your opportunities. Providing visibility around who is buying services enhances our understanding of our clients’ issues and strengthens relationships. Log your meetings to facilitate discussion. Keep the data current. Moving your opportunities through the pursuit stages in a timely manner leads to greater transparency for the account, as well as for our leadership teams -- helping them more effectively identify opportunities they can help at the appropriate times. New enhancements are coming with the next Salesforce release on Monday, May 6, including the ability to save Chatter posts as drafts. See more below. Release outage Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, May 3, at 8 p.m. ET to Sunday, May 5, at noon ET. Coming Monday: Chatter draft Salesforce heard us -- losing a Chatter post you spent time crafting is a pain! With the May 6 release, you will be able to save your Chatter post as a draft to post later (available via desktop version of Salesforce). Here’s how: Type your Chatter post as usual. You will see Saved appear below the post as the system automatically saves your content. To access your draft at a later time, select the Chatter tab from the top menu and click My Drafts on the left side. From there, click on the down arrow on any draft and select Edit, Publish or Delete. An update on new fields Client Data Use Provision: We’ve seen tremendous success with securing the client data use provision in client contracts and are now using Salesforce to capture our progress. For every non-audit opportunity won, complete the new US Client Data Use Contract Provision field on the Opportunity details page in Salesforce. This Quick Reference Card has instructions. We communicated how to capture the status for our recurring annual audit engagements and other assurance engagements to our Core Assurance and PCS Assurance partners last week. Additionally, in the May 6 release, you’ll see the first steps for two updates in Salesforce that will be put into practice later this summer. No action is required; stay tuned for next steps: Director Allocated Bookings: For FY20, each line of service will provide guidance and messaging for a new feature that allows Allocated Bookings to be awarded at the director level on certain wins (subject to our independence rules). AFS integration: New fields will appear on Opportunities and Clients related to AFS status, although actual integration with AFS will not be enabled until later this summer. Have feedback to share?

One way we do this is by pairing each new joiner with an onboarding ambassador — a go-to person to help them learn the ins and outs of PwC. Want to be the go-to person for a new joiner? Apply to become an onboarding ambassador! We’re always looking for ambassadors for our experienced hires, and as we get ready to welcome entry level hires this summer and fall, we’re looking for even more of our people to join our ranks and apply. Corey Chin (left, new joiner) and Meaghan Hand (right, ambassador) try to connect in person whenever they’re in the office. Onboarding ambassadors connect with their new joiners before their first day to welcome them to the firm, answer any initial questions and let them know they’ll be in touch to set up a lunch date after their first day. After that, they have regular touch points over the new joiner’s first six months. The onboarding ambassador time commitment is generally a total of three to five hours over the new joiner’s first six months. Watch this video for more information about the ambassador/new joiner relationship. The program is designed to connect new joiners with their teams and offices right away Whenever possible, ambassadors are matched with new joiners in their line of service, city and staff level to help maximize connectivity. Onboarding ambassadors share their experiences: Meaghan Hand, Tax: The onboarding ambassador program is great for anyone interested in breaking into mentoring. My new joiner has appreciated the monthly check points and uses me as a resource for general questions he has about PwC. Even during busy times, if we can’t meet in person, he knows I’m still here. Karen Quarles, IFS: I enjoy helping new joiners navigate the firm and sharing tips and tricks to help them feel confident as they start at PwC. Serving as an onboarding ambassador touches most, if not all, of PwC’s core values. Honoring these values is something I’m truly proud of. Tom Van Oosterom, Advisory: Whether a new joiner is just starting out in their career or has years of experience, they’re all new to PwC. Their questions definitely evolve the longer they’re with PwC — they usually start with asking about things like what courses are mandatory and signing up for benefits, and then we move on to talking about Snapshots and tools like TalentLink. Andrea Vorlicek, Assurance: I really enjoy being an onboarding ambassador. It’s a great way to meet new people outside of those you work with every day. Most of the questions my new joiners ask are questions I remember having when I started at PwC: dress code, Snapshots, requesting vacation, etc. Having a dedicated person to ask these questions of, knowing there will be no judgement, is really important. For more information, check out these ambassador resources. Then, apply to make a difference to new joiners as they start their PwC careers!

I'm Tim Redding, Director and US/Mexico Security leader, based out of the Seattle office. I've been with the firm for 24 years. What’s a typical day for you? Each day revolves around helping our people and their families whenever there are concerns for their safety. I oversee our crisis teams, who hold regular safety risk assessments and emergency drills in our offices so we can stay ahead of disruptive events. We also run business continuity tests to make sure we can still serve our clients and run our business properly during an emergency. Collaborating with a wide range of PwC teams helps us expand our ability to identify risks and threats. How did your journey lead you to this role? After college graduation my passion turned to travel, and one of the first places I visited was Hawaii. I noticed a booming economy, and, on a whim, applied for a few jobs, including one at PwC. The firm hired me and I moved to Honolulu, just like that! I handled everything from IT tech support to finance and operations -- a great way to “learn the firm.” I later left PwC for an opportunity in Dallas, where I ran IT operations at a regional level. Always looking to learn and grow, the next stop on my journey was attending Harvard University to pursue a master’s degree. But, guess what? They asked me to help out in their IT department, which was supposed to be a part-time job while I earned my degree. But it soon morphed into a full-time job protecting against network hackers and cyber criminals. Everything came full circle when I was recruited back to the firm in my current role blending my love of security and IT. How does your team bring value to PwC? We’re here when you need us most. That’s the simplest way I know how to put it. We care about the safety of our people, 24 hours a day, wherever they are across the world. By putting the PwC core value of “care” in action -- whether on US soil or abroad -- we can assist in any kind of emergency. Providing comfort in challenging times is the lifeblood of our team, whether through safety measures, counseling, financial support, legal assistance and more. Being on the front lines and providing safe harbor for our people in times of need is the most rewarding part of our job. We’re a one-stop shop for safety; we live and breathe it. What might we be surprised to learn about you? I’m a competitive downhill skier -- and I can sometimes win in my age group! Through sports I learned about teamwork and staying calm under pressure, which also helps me do my job effectively when navigating our people through an emergency. My uncle was a great role model; he was a US Air Force pilot and taught me how to fly a plane. I typically just observed him, but one day he handed me the controls and told me to fly the plane myself. I had no choice but to stay calm -- and I did it!
