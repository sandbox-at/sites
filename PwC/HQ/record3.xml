After recognizing the potential of this bot to save an immense amount of hours across the firm, the Tax Automation CoE and the PwC Labs team partnered together to further automate and improve the bot, and to increase its scale to include both federal and state tax extension forms (including forms 1065, 1120, 1120S, and more). Next, the team introduced the bots to the Global Delivery Model (GDM) team to further centralize the process and build our expertise across our support network. Kristen Sauvigne, director in Tax, oversaw the workstreams as the project lead and has seen the success of these bots firsthand. “One State and Local Tax (SALT) engagement prepares more than 300 extension forms during a one-week period in the month of February,” said Kristen. “They were able to leverage the extension bots this year and save 50 percent of the time they had budgeted for the work. They reduced their hours on extensions from 100 down to 50, just by leveraging these automation tools!” In addition to the SALT team, there are many more teams who have saved time with these bots, including, an Asset and Wealth Management (AWM) engagement team that reduced their time spent on extensions by 80 percent, moving from 25 hours down to 5 for their 55 extensions, and another AWM team cut out 30 hours from processing their 75 extensions. A Banking, Capital Markets and Insurance (BCMI) engagement team also reduced their time by 72 percent by spending only 54 hours — down from 194 — on their 145 tax extensions. Following the busy season in Tax, the Tax Automation CoE and the PwC Labs team has plans to continue to improve these bots. To date, the success of the tax extension bots has been astounding: 33,380 runs in Digital Lab 1,409 unique users across 14 different markets/geographies 70 percent of users are from GDM More than 180 jurisdictions/forms supported through the bots Check out these time-saving tax extension bots now in Digital Lab: GoSystem Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Attended (Desktop): A desktop bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in GoSystems GoSystem Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Unattended (Server): A server bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in GoSystems OneSource Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Attended (Desktop): A desktop bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in OneSource OneSource Extensions (Federal and State) Bot - Unattended (Server): A server bot to help automate the preparation of extension forms/vouchers in OneSource Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Tax Automation CoE Workstream leads: Scott Stein (Partner/MD sponsor), Kristen Sauvigne (project lead), Shiv Kuncham, Elizabeth Robles, Christopher Wein, Stacey Chen Automation core team: Danny Park, Matthew Buckles, Scott Holland, Nathaniel White, Nitya Vashishtha, Bailee Kwilinski, Duy Nyugen PwC Labs: Brett Kelley, Jay Krames, Chris Bigley and the Digital Lab team Tax GDM: Wendy Martin and 30+ Tax GDM extension champions AWM SALT: Paulina Keating Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40601.html</url><pwc_title>Spread summer joy with Real-time recognition </pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-10 03:27:46</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>news-type:Firmwide</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title>Spread some summer joy with Real-time recognition </pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>Give a deserving colleague’s (and your own) emotional energy a boost with Real-time recognition.

Chief Digital Officer Joe Atkinson and Digital Talent Leader Sarah McEneaney welcomed the Digital Accelerators to the space-themed two-and-a-half-day immersive experience, and shared PwC’s vision for our Digital Accelerators and upskilling PwC as a whole. With their out-of-office messages set to things like “I’m in orbit” and “busy building rockets,” the Digital Accelerators spent their time gaining important skills in areas including Design Thinking, Agile, creative problem-solving, storytelling, networking and preparing for their new roles. The enthusiasm that carried through the entire event from opening to closing was overwhelming. Learning and Development Leader Katrina Salem summed it up well: “This might have been the first time we ever had a standing ovation at the end of an L&amp;D program!” Futurist Jacob Morgan who hosts the Future of Work podcast, sat down with Sarah for a conversation that included inspiring insights into his work as a futurist and wrote about the Liftoff session on LinkedIn, "This is actually one of the best approaches I've seen any company take to future proof their employees." Here are just a few highlights of Liftoff (knowing that we don’t want to give away too much before our upcoming sessions in August, October and January)! These Digital Accelerators are ready for liftoff! Sarah McEneaney and Jacob Morgan before their sit-down conversation. Drone and virtual reality demonstrations Tim Ryan shared a virtual message, thanking the Digital Accelerators for raising their hands to join the program and letting them know the firm is counting on them as agents of digital change. Everyone had fun posing with our favorite astronauts! You can see from this word cloud that our Digital Accelerators were inspired and empowered by their Liftoff experiences. “PwC is go” and we have liftoff -- and a mic drop: Sarah McEneaney led a fitting countdown to conclude the Liftoff mission. This first group of Digital Accelerators will now take what they learned at Liftoff and, depending on their lines of service/IFS, continue their learning while applying their new knowledge into their assignments on the ground. Three more Liftoff sessions are planned for August, October and January, during which the rest of our first class will be welcomed aboard. Interested in becoming a Digital Accelerator? The next call for self nominations for Digital Accelerators will happen later in FY19. In the meantime, there are many things we all can do now to build our digital skills. For instance, we can continue on our journey to Digital Fitness through the Digital Fitness app and accessing the digital assets in Vantage (while you’re there, sign up for daily tech updates from MIT Tech Review!). And we’ll soon launch a variety of easily consumable Digital Fitness learning assets, delivered in unexpected ways, with the goal of bringing everyone in the firm to the Digital Fitness level by September 2019. We’ll start the launch of this exciting cascade with our “Tech While You Trek” podcast series, within the soon-to-launch PwC Podcast app later this summer. You can find the latest podcasts now by searching “Tech While You Trek” on Vantage.

With their passing, we were reminded once again that no one, regardless of their wealth or status, is immune to the effects of mental illness. While dealing with these issues can feel like trying to find your way out of a lonely and dark place, talking to someone is the first step to coming back into the light.

What you need to know about US economic sanct Working internationally? What you need to know about US economic sanctions Ethics &amp; Compliance Oct. 18, 2018 US economic sanctions continue to dominate the news headlines, particularly with the recent expansion of sanctions on Russia and Venezuela. These sanctions may impact our work related to non-US entities -- and could restrict services, primarily in the financial and energy sectors. Economic sanctions are very complex and change regularly. Cuba, Crimea (region of Ukraine), Darfur (region of Sudan), Iran, North Korea and Syria remain subject to comprehensive US sanctions. Check this guidance and up-to-date listing of both embargoed and higher-risk countries. If you have any concerns, consult. A breach of US sanctions rules, even if inadvertent, can have serious consequences for you and the firm, potentially resulting in civil and criminal penalties. Consultations with Government E&amp;C and Risk Management are required before engaging in any transaction, directly or indirectly, involving an embargoed country or a country that presents a higher sanctions risk. Please make sure you review our PwC US Sanctions Policy to understand your compliance and reporting responsibilities. Remember PwC’s Antiques Roadshow in this year’s Independence, Ethics and Compliance Training? If you haven’t completed your training yet and want to do it now, click here and learn more about economic sanctions as well as other compliance requirements, due April 23.

Note, the engagement letter submitted for signature should incorporate any changes made by the AFS Scope-of-Services Review team. For these tax services, a minimum of two approvals is required: 1. the Primary Approver (the Responsible Partner for your client, as listed in CES) that is auto populated by the AFS system (usually the audit partner or the GRP), AND 2. the “AFS SoSRteam” (GUID = AFS001), which you must manually add as a Contact and check the “Approver” box, in order for the AFS Scope-of-Services Review team to be notified. Additional reminders include: · Add a draft of your engagement letter in an editable Word version. · Be sure to read and complete the questionnaire you receive from the AFS Scope-of-Services Review team after your AFS is submitted. · Don't put "ASAP" as your required deadline. Explain your Client specific deadline within the request so that the review team can prioritize appropriately. Understand the Independence rules that apply – review them before you complete your review request. · Ensure the engagement letter clearly describes the proposed services and the delineation between PwC’s role and the role of the Client. · Identify the Client oversight contact and explain how you know this person is both capable and willing to oversee the project. Watch the video “5 Tips to create better AFS requests” for additional simple ways to make the second-level review process go more smoothly. Visit the AFS Scope-of-Services Review team Spark page where you can find the AFS review team members and other useful information, such as the AFS Quick Reference Card.

As we create a better digital experience, we’re forging stronger connections that support growth and development with tools, processes and information powered by Workday. Some of the ways we’re creating a stronger people experience include: Ability to give and receive upward and peer feedback anytime with anyone across the network, strengthening our developmental culture. Gaining additional support through development teams. These teams will be responsible for coaching, guiding and helping you develop in your career. They will consist of a Relationship Leader, Career Coach, and for our seniors and associates in client service, a Connectivity Partner.

We’re sunsetting Lotus Notes email in phases -- and the next step on this simplification journey is deleting our old email archives. We’ve got good news: This step is pretty painless! Through the end of FY19, everyone will still have access to your most recent three to four years of Lotus Notes emails. You really won’t notice much of an impact when the older email archives are gone, particularly if you joined PwC within the last four years and you’ve been using Google Mail as your primary email system. What to expect On Jan. 15, we’ll delete all but the most recent Lotus Notes email archives from your PC*. You’ll get a popup notification before it happens -- and up to three opportunities to defer. *Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold, or part of an exception group. Read more on what that means and check to see if a Legal Hold applies to you. Your most recent email archive will stay in place, for now. So will your current Lotus Notes mailbox -- giving you access to your most recent three to four years of emails. But wait! I’ve got important stuff in Lotus Notes! We understand it can be hard to let go. So we’ve got a number of tools and resources to help you find, move and appropriately store any information in Lotus Notes that continues to hold business value. Whether you’re still a heavy user of Lotus Notes or you just have a few old emails you want to save, we’ve got everything you need on our Data Remediation page. Next steps toward Lotus Notes sunsetting Deleting our old email archives is the first step -- but we know you’re ready to move completely away from managing two email systems! Here’s what you can expect as we keep moving forward: By the end of FY19, we’ll put in place a new 18-month retention period on our current Lotus Notes mailboxes. (In plain English, this means we’ll start automatically deleting Lotus Notes emails when they hit the 18-months-old milestone.) Also next year, we’ll start a similar retention period for our Google Mail, calendar events, Google Drive, Google Keep, Sites and G+ content. (We'll give you plenty of warning, but you can start to prepare now by refreshing yourself on our systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration.) Later next year, we’ll be ready to delete everyone’s last Lotus Notes email archive and stop issuing new joiners Lotus Notes profiles altogether. More to know The way we approach data as a firm is changing. As part of a multi-year data journey, we’ve implemented robust, modern systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration. At the same time, we’re retiring outdated data storage systems; deleting redundant, obsolete and trivial data; and implementing best-in-class guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle.

Workday makes it easy to refer candidates and apply for ne Got talent? Workday makes it easy to refer candidates and apply for new roles People Team Sept. 24, 2018 The launch of Workday in August brought some exciting changes to our people experience, such as connecting to development teams, upward and peer feedback and the ability to self-manage personal information. Workday is also the place where you can refer experienced external candidates and apply for internal roles. Talent knows talent: Refer qualified individuals from your network Do you know someone who has the right qualifications for a position at PwC? Some of our best candidates come from referrals by our people. In fact, we’ve found that candidate referrals stay with the firm longer. Referring experienced candidates is easy in Workday. Simply type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to get started and find a job that suits your referral. Our new process gives you greater visibility into your recommended candidate -- you can easily check the status of submitted referrals at any time (type ”My Referrals” in the Workday search bar). An added incentive? If you refer a candidate who is hired, you may be eligible for a referral award. Please note: Only experienced referrals should be submitted through Workday. Refer to the Employee Referral Program site for guidance regarding entry-level referrals. To receive a referral award, you must submit experienced referrals to a posted open role through Workday before your referral applies for the role.Immediately after you submit the experienced referral, an automated email will go to the referred candidate directing them to apply through a specific link. The referred candidate must use that link to apply for the job in order to be tagged as a referral. If they do not, you will not receive credit as the referring employee. For appropriate credit and status updates, referred candidates cannot be accepted through Google email or any other means except the Workday referral application link (effective today). Referred candidates will not be visible to recruiters until the candidate has applied for the job. For more information, take a moment to review the Employee Referral Program quick reference card (QRC) and policy. Make sure you follow the guidance above so you don’t miss out on a referral bonus! If you have questions about submitting referrals, please contact the Employee Referral Team. Grow in your career with PwC: Applying for internal roles and tours As we grow and evolve in our jobs at PwC, the time may come when a new role more closely aligns with our qualifications and career aspirations. With Workday, all you need to do is type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to explore and apply for an internal role. Please note: All applications for internal roles and tours must be made through Workday and will leverage your TalentLink profile (if you have one). Internal candidates must inform their coach, relationship leader and People team of their application at the time of posting. If selected to be interviewed, it is also the candidate’s responsibility to continue to keep this group updated throughout the process. The new Workday functionality replaces the previous process for applying for tours in Quest. For more information, review the Applying to an Internal Role QRC and policy. If you have questions about applying for internal roles, please reach out to your local People team contact.

Beginning Jan. 1, 2019, you can: Contribute up to $19,000 (up from $18,500 in 2018) on a pre-tax basis to your PwC 401(k) Savings Plan account. Contribute an additional $6,000 pre-tax, if you’ll be age 50 or older by Dec. 31, 2019. (You can make after-tax contributions, too.) Add more to the commuter program; 2019 limits are increasing to $265 per month for transit expenses and $265 per month for parking expenses (up from $260 for each in 2018). 401(k) Savings Plan Are you contributing to the 401(k) Savings Plan? You can increase, decrease or stop your 401(k) contribution amount at any time throughout the year via Benefits Express Online. Here are five reasons you should save as much as you can in the 401(k) Savings Plan. The pre-tax dollars you contribute do not count toward your gross income for the year. This lowers your taxable income -- and your taxes. The firm matches 25% of the first 6% of eligible compensation that you contribute. If you’re saving less than 6%, or you’re not contributing in each pay period throughout the year, you’re losing out on free money because you’re not receiving the maximum firm matching contribution. Your balance can grow over time with investment earnings. PwC offers you the flexibility to select investments based on your personal investment approach. You can use any and all of the offerings across the three investment profile tiers to create your own portfolio. Investment earnings are tax deferred. Because your investment earnings are rolled back into the plan, they don't have to be listed as income on your tax return until you withdraw them. Your savings grow faster this way. You can take your vested account balance with you if you change jobs, and roll it over to another qualified plan or IRA. Doing this simple procedure will keep your savings tax-deferred. (You’re always vested in your own contributions. You vest in the firm’s contributions over a period of five years based on a graded vesting schedule.)

The National Commuter Benefits Program If you take public transportation to work or pay for parking, the Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax earnings each pay period in a WageWorks account to pay for work-related transit and/or parking expenses. In fact, using pre-tax dollars for expenses you’re already paying for can save you up to 30% of your commuting costs -- you save on federal taxes, state taxes (in most states) and FICA.

Give a little thanks today! Boost a colleague’s emotional well-being. Give a little thanks today! People Team July 9, 2018 We’ll soon launch a new tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool. During the cutover period (July and August), you may still recognize others for a job well done. Did you know that showing gratitude fuels our emotional energy? It aligns with Be well, work well, a vital component of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Remember how you felt the last time someone told you what a great job you were doing? Recognition makes people feel really good about themselves and motivates them to keep up the good work. Positive reinforcement sets an example for everyone in our organization, at any level, showing them the kind of work you value most. Here are some ways to recognize others during our transition: Write a personal thank-you note for someone’s contributions or download this editable card, fill it out and attach to an email. At your next team meeting, offer a gratitude jar or board where team members can share kind comments about each other or say “thank you” to a colleague. Make recognition something you do regularly. Add it as an agenda item in a team meeting or write a thank-you note every day. Once recognition becomes a habit, you won’t have to think twice to do it. What you need to know during this transition: Monetary awards: If you received monetary recognition in FY18 and have yet to redeem for gift cards, you will need to redeem them by August 31. Please note: You'll need to click on the link found in your Real-time recognition reward email(s) to redeem. Questions: Contact Hallmark. Uninstall the app: The current Real-time recognition app in PwC's App Store will be disabled. If you downloaded the app, uninstall it from your device.

PwC’s 2018 Global Blockchain Survey includes insights from 600 executives from 15 territories, with 84% saying their organization has at least some involvement with blockchain technology. Companies have dabbled in the lab; perhaps they’ve built proofs of concept. Everyone is talking about blockchain, and no one wants to be left behind. It’s easy to see why. As a distributed, tamperproof ledger, a well-designed blockchain doesn’t just cut out intermediaries, reduce costs and increase speed and reach. It also offers greater transparency and traceability for many business processes. Gartner forecasts that blockchain will generate an annual business value of more than US $3 trillion by 2030. It’s possible to imagine that 10-20% of global economic infrastructure will be running on blockchain-based systems by that same year. Bloomberg, CNBC, Forbes and Fortune are just some of the major media outlets that have written about the report; and, of course, we’ve received prominent coverage around our Blockchain Validation Solution, a services and software solution that provides governance teams, including internal audit, risk management, legal and compliance, with the transparency and continuous assurance to move blockchain projects from pilot to production. If you haven’t already, start the blockchain conversation with your client today. Our new report outlines four strategies for clients navigating this new world: Make the blockchain business case. Identify the business value. Strategic clarity will ensure that your blockchain initiative has a business purpose around which you and other participants can align. Build an industry ecosystem. Consider the benefits of collaboration. Blockchain may call for competitors to collaborate in a new way, as they come together to solve industry-wide problems. Design deliberately. Explore potential blockchain models. Every blockchain will require rules and standards, particularly around what various participants will be able to access and how they can engage. Navigate regulatory uncertainty. Understand the shifting regulatory landscape. You’ll need to stay agile to meet regulatory requirements as they evolve in the years to come.

With the help of influential actresses and business leaders, the “Me Too” phrase has turned into a movement, spurring conversations over sexual harassment and encouraging both women and men to speak up. In an effort to have an open dialogue on sexual harassment and the policies and procedures put in place at PwC, individuals from our diversity and inclusion team as well as our ethics and business conduct team are teaming up to hold a “Candid Conversation about Respect in the Workplace” in offices across the United States – reaching over 40 offices in the past year. On April 26, 2019 the GP2W Speaker Series Committee invited Chris Brassell, Inclusion and Diversity Director, and Steve Kessler, Ethics and Business Conduct Director, to the Cincinnati office to hold an open conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace. With over 3o people in attendance, Chris and Steve’s presentation quickly turned into an open dialogue between colleagues. People asked tough questions, shared their thoughts and opinions, and some spoke from a place of personal experience. Finding the courage to speak up about sexual harassment can be a tough ask, however, PwC is continually striving to foster an environment that encourages people to speak up and speak out against sexual harassment. Having continual open dialogues over the topic of sexual harassment is just one of many steps in cultivating an inclusive work environment, albeit an important one.

So what compelled him to select the picturesque island as his vacation destination? “Iceland’s soccer team had recently been covered extensively by sports journalists and it caught my interest,” Ryan explained. The country captured the hearts and minds of soccer fans by becoming the smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup. While the team was never expected to win the tournament, they distinguished themselves in a different way with their “Viking clap”: players and fans in unison clapping their hands above their heads while crying out “Huh” to the beat of a drum. The chant quickly became a fan favorite. “I had also heard the island is known known for over 20 hours of daylight daily and offered endless adventures,” Ryan said. “So I booked it.” Racking up rewards points Ryan’s trip happened to coincide with the launch of our digitally enabled Well-Being Rewards Program through Virgin Pulse. He was able to rack up a ton of Well-Being Reward points, given the amount of hiking and sightseeing Iceland had to offer. “During my short four-day tour, I logged more than 82,000 steps all while experiencing breathtaking waterfalls and warm natural spring waters from the island’s famous geysers,” he said. To accumulate more points, Ryan perused the Virgin Pulse app on long car rides around the island. He browsed healthy recipes on Zipongo, tracked his daily habits, and listened to Whil mindfulness sessions to further decompress on his vacation. “Having access to the Whil program is a great benefit,” Ryan said. “I learned so much about emotional intelligence and new techniques to manage stress.” Ryan is grateful to work for a firm that encourages mindfulness and an active lifestyle. Not only did he return from Iceland feeling refreshed and able to be his best self, but he had enough Well-Being Rewards points to earn? a gift card. Not everyone will have the chance travel to Iceland, but hopefully Ryan’s story inspires you to be well, live better and earn Well-Being Rewards!

This was the first time we tried something like that as a firm, and it was a powerful and memorable day -- but it was only the beginning. What came next was not something I was planning or expecting. But when talking to many people inside the firm, the question we kept hearing was, “What’s next? How can we do more?” We looked at what we could do inside PwC, and we made our blind spots unconscious bias training part of the path to promotion. Because we started talking to each other about race, we’ve also been able to talk about gender equity and respect in the workplace, as these issues became part of our national conversation. Inspired by all of you, we’ve also taken the conversation on diversity and inclusion beyond the walls of PwC. That day two years ago provided the spark that became the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™ -- and we became leaders in helping the business community take action, learn from each other, and make progress on these very important issues. Our purpose means we are called to take on important issues that matter to our people, to our clients and to society. The steps we’ve taken over the last two years are a perfect example of what it means to be a firm with a purpose and an inclusive culture, where all of our people feel included and a sense of belonging. And once again it’s time to ask, “What’s next?” We started with a conversation, and this is something we can continue to do every day. Taking the time to ask about others’ experiences and to listen is something we can do anytime. One of the next steps we took was to share training and resources to help all of us grow our awareness and understanding of these issues. This includes blind spots training that’s open to everyone at PwC and Outsmarting Human Minds to help us think through everyday decisions. Take time to explore these resources and talk about them with your colleagues. With CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion, we’ve created a platform to connect with others and drive change. As we often talk about internally -- scale is powerful. We have a goal of reaching 1,000 companies, knowing that the more like-minded organizations that come together, the greater our reach, and the more change we can drive. You don’t have to be talking to the CEO to share the resources of the CEO Action website -- which is open to all. It’s a great starting point for opening up a discussion with the people in your network. Team, it’s been my privilege to have the opportunity to talk with many of you over the last couple of years and to represent our firm in the business community. What inspires me each day is how much people both inside and outside the firm care about making progress on these issues and want to be part of the solution. And that makes me optimistic that we can continue to become even more inclusive as a firm and a society.

Here are answers to four questions we know you have on your mind: Where do we stand with the bonus pool? We’ve accomplished a lot this year, from the thousands of hours taken out of our client engagements and projects through our citizen-led efforts under Your Tomorrow, to the steps we’ve taken to continuously streamline and simplify the way we work and deliver as One Firm. Because we’re focused on the right things and our business is growing, we’re in the position to increase our bonus pool with an uplift similar to last year. The increased bonus pool is a reflection of all we have to be proud of this year, and allows us to recognize the impact of our collective efforts. This does not mean that individual bonuses will be higher — it simply means our overall pool has increased and your leaders will have additional dollars to allocate beyond our baseline targets. As a reminder, when the firm does well, the partners increase the bonus pool and during years where financial targets are not met, the overall pool could be reduced. How do I see the bonus ranges? Bonus targets for staff are available in the Me@PwC app. Download the app from PwC’s App Store to see all your total rewards on the go. How are bonuses determined? Consistent with prior years, relationship leaders finalize bonus decisions during Career Roundtable discussions based on each person’s performance and impact. When will I find out the results of the Career Roundtable discussions? A lot of care goes into this process — and you’ll hear the results between June 17-28 when Career Outlook conversations take place. Look for a calendar invite from your Relationship Leader (or reach out to set it up).

Entering similar information across multiple systems … confusion about next steps … and uncertainty about the timing of code release. The process can be frustrating and time-consuming. Good news -- your life is about to get simpler and easier, with Rapid Engage. What is Rapid Engage? Rapid Engage is designed to help you get from opportunity identification to WBS code release faster. Think of those “pizza trackers” that allow customers to watch their pizza status as it moves from order, to oven, and out for delivery. Rapid Engage is designed with that transparency -- and ease of use -- in mind. The tool overlays our existing client and engagement acceptance systems (including A&amp;C, AFS, engagement contracts, myEngage and others), providing one interface that helps you complete required process steps and track your progress. Once released to your team, Rapid Engage will be available from your desktop and mobile device. Rapid Engage is launching in a phased approach across the firm during the month of August, beginning today. Your line of service will share launch details with your team over the next few weeks with instructions on how to access the system. (The initial release of Rapid Engage will be deployed in the US only. Mexico will have access later this year.) In the meantime, watch the preview video below to see a sneak peek of Rapid Engage in action. How does it work? Rapid Engage doesn’t change our existing client acceptance policies and procedures -- it just makes the entire process easier for you. Once an opportunity moves beyond the “Target” stage in Salesforce, it automatically displays on the Rapid Engage landing page, for all opportunity team members listed in Salesforce. Clicking on an individual opportunity takes you to the “Client Details” tab, where all required client and engagement acceptance steps are outlined based on the client type, restriction status, and proposed service. Once the client acceptance and engagement details steps have been completed, Rapid Engage goes into action, triggering the remaining engagement acceptance steps for you. The tool auto-initiates forms and pre-populates some required fields based on the information you’ve already provided, and continues to guide you all the way through code set up and release. Rapid Engage provides clear instructions on next steps and sends real-time notifications about required information that’s missing, so you always stay on track. You can check status anytime on your desktop or through the mobile app. What do I need to do once my team gets access? Get to know Rapid Engage. Stay tuned for launch announcements throughout August from your line of service. When Rapid Engage launches to your team, you’ll receive a Quick Reference Guide and detailed FAQs on the tool and how it interacts with the underlying systems. PwC Help (877-792-4357, option 1, option 3) is also standing by to offer assistance. Make sure opportunity information in Salesforce is complete and accurate. From the date of release to your team, Rapid Engage will pull new US opportunities entered into Salesforce as soon as those opportunities move beyond the “Target” stage in Salesforce. The old adage remains true: “Garbage in, garbage out.” If the underlying data in Salesforce isn’t comprehensive and accurate, you won’t get the full benefit from the new tool. Watch for tracker-initiated alerts and respond to them in a timely and accurate fashion. This will reduce unnecessary back-and-forth, and help avoid delays. Spread the word! Encourage your colleagues to use Rapid Engage when it rolls out to them. As more of us take advantage of this new tool, we have the opportunity to make significant efficiencies real, and continually improve the user experience.

Just ask the small ARCA team from the midwest who came up with the idea for our Halo for MLA Scoping tool. What was once a simple visualization dashboard for an internal audit client has grown into an Assurance-wide web-based application available for use by more than 1,000 engagement teams. Here’s how. Innovation doesn’t necessarily need to be complicated to be successful. But there are two important aspects it does require: a great idea and a support system to arm you with the right tools and resources. So when ARCA team (Director Jen Couser, Managers Jamin Kee, Aaron Mayer and Sebtastin Englert) raised the idea of building out a new dashboard to make it easier for audit teams to create the Multilocation Audit Scoping Documentation Template - Appendix B, ASM&amp;T team (Partner Mary Grace Davenport, Managing Director Staci Wheeler and Director Devan Bailey) helped make it happen. After a couple of short months, the team was able to create a prototype and share it with several engagement teams, who immediately saw its benefits -- a more efficient work process and an enhanced ability to evaluate scoping decisions. After a short demonstration, ASM&amp;T realized the potential of this tool to continue to enhance quality and value while also addressing a pain point. As a result, they leveraged relationships within the network to sponsor the design and build the end product with the specialist development skills of the Global Assurance Tools &amp; Technology team (thanks to Managing Director J.R. Williams, Director Lori Morris and Senior Manager Carolyn Mourey). This is an excellent example of how taking the time to evaluate and question the impact of a specific process or tool can lead to an innovative idea. So, the next time you’re frustrated by a process, take a minute to stop and think about how you might be able to enhance it. Because the next big idea could start with you!

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. 1. Name, rank, serial number? I'm Seery Maggio, a director in National Real Estate Operations based out of the Denver office. I've been with the firm since 2009. 2. What’s a typical day like for you? I travel often; I'm currently involved in the renovation of our headquarters in Mexico. When there, I typically meet with real estate colleagues -- as well as IT, office services and others -- for all-day work sessions where we handle planning, problem solving and leveraging new technologies impacting the renovation. I manage communications to keep our people apprised of renovation timelines and how they may be affected; it helps that I’m fluent in Spanish! Our team leads all aspects of real estate operations, from renovations to opening new sites. Over the past few years we've opened over 30 new PwC offices worldwide. 3. How did your journey lead you to this role? When I first joined the firm I facilitated Oracle implementations in what was then called Advisory People &amp; Change. I then helped build a new client-facing change methodology, formerly known as Transform, which included preparing templates and tool kits, as well as teaching training sessions. I later joined National Real Estate, led by Willem VanDooijeweert, where I am today, leading and delivering strategic change for both PwC and our clients. 4. How does your team bring value to PwC? National Real Estate is one of the few teams in IFS that does external client work. In addition to firm real estate operations, we help clients with Workforce of the Future and Fit For Growth opportunities, partnering with other client teams. Externally, we participate in client workshops, helping clients think through the people impacts and all other aspects of potential headquarters moves. This includes education and messaging around the physical move itself, as well as the overall employee experience, workplace technology and the real estate required to attract and retain the future talent of the business. I'm proud of our team; we keep respect and collaboration at the forefront and sincerely want to see each other succeed. We also embrace flexibility; we are located throughout the country and enjoy leveraging new technology to connect. 5. What would people be surprised to know about you? During the summer, my dog Coco and I volunteer at Craig Hospital in Denver, a facility that focuses on helping those with brain and spinal injuries. Pet therapy is very rewarding; we love bringing the patients and their families as much joy as possible during these therapeutic visits. In addition to my commitment to pet therapy, I also have an obsession with antiques. I adore antiquing and going to estate sales. From rugs to furniture to artwork to chandeliers -- I'm a super fan of anything with a history! Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way?

In addition to following the specific risk management protocols for these types of engagements, engagement teams should be sure to include adequate documentation of our work, advice given, assumptions, and our client’s involvement in the engagement files, on a contemporaneous basis (see Documentation policy). It is preferable for tax engagement teams to obtain a timely representation letter from a client in connection with a tax accounting service engagement. The representation letter is intended to memorialize the respective roles and responsibilities of PwC and management, as well as reaffirm management’s responsibility for decisions, judgments and review over the course of the engagement. A template of the Representation Letter can be found in the C2 Tax Accounting Services toolkit along with a comprehensive list of helpful tools and templates. Our documentation in DMS, either through the use of a representation letter or otherwise, should include contemporaneous evidence that the client took responsibility for decisions and judgments and was involved in the review of our work and deliverables. When transmitting deliverables for tax accounting service engagements, the tax engagement team should ensure the deliverables are only transmitted to the client. If any third party file-sharing websites such as SharePoint, Box or Dropbox are used to transmit deliverables, US IT approval is required, even if the client is one of the file-sharing sites. To request an exception for a file-sharing website, email Security-Exception-Request@pwc.com, (see: https://pwc-spark.com/docs/DOC-729687). Learn more For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that there is separate guidance for engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients. Need help?

The Deals mid-year review and outlook reveal that the number of deals north of $5 billion in 2018 is on pace to double last year’s total, and to date has driven overall deal value up by more than 50%. Transactions are also getting bigger, with more announced deals of at least $30 billion so far in 2018 than in all of 2017. As US economic growth remains steady, that momentum should continue and will likely accelerate as lingering questions around tax policy and big vertical deals have largely been answered. The current M&amp;A cycle has been quite uneven, and the pattern will likely continue in the months ahead. Share the full Deals mid-year report and outlook with your clients, and in the meantime review the five things shaping the current deals market: Money to spend: Since the start of 2018, one-third of megadeals crossed sector lines, driven largely by an appetite for new technologies. Capital cushion: US corporations and investors continue to hold on to cash and keep valuations elevated. High oil prices: The growing demand for goods and services may be a sign that the pace of economic growth is nowhere close to slowing down. US tax reform: Execs are re-evaluating growth strategies, including how much to commit toward M&amp;A versus buybacks or increased dividends. Antitrust ruling: A surge of megadeals could hit the market now that AT&amp;T’s plans to buy Time Warner have been cleared. Deals is one of our PwC platforms designed to help us address the issues most important to our non-audit clients.

We've held many difficult conversations across our firm since Bo Jean was killed. We've raised over a half million dollars to commemorate Bo through scholarships in his name. At the same time, we also have more to do inside PwC. I wanted to share what we’re working on next and you’ll be hearing more from me in the next few weeks. We’re asking the 500+ signatories of the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion to join us in a day of dialogue on race and differences, at each of our respective companies, on Friday December 7. Our firm will take a leadership role, sharing resources and offering the help of PwC people, at no cost, to assist other organizations in holding these discussions. Together, we’ll create opportunities across the business community to talk more openly about the experiences of our diverse colleagues and help all of our professionals understand what their co-workers and friends experience. I encourage you to talk to your clients about this effort -- working with your partner and team so we share a coordinated message and help them get involved. I also want to thank everyone who participated in the discussions inside the firm over the last few weeks -- and you’ll hear more about the day of dialogue and how we will participate as we get closer to December 7. As many of you know, earlier in the summer, we launched the CEO Action’s Check Your Blind Spots mobile tour. We originally planned the tour to visit workplaces and universities with training to help people recognize, acknowledge, and minimize potential blind spots. Now we’re expanding the tour to include a third and very important component: We’ll work with mayors and city councils to bring unconscious bias training to local communities. Our goal for these actions is simple. As a purpose-led firm, we want to remember Bo and make our world a little better by taking on the difficult issues around race and differences that are troubling so many of us. By helping people inside and outside PwC better understand unconscious bias, we can be part of the solution.

Just like updates to apps or a phone, these continuous improvements to Salesforce functionality and capability reflect your feedback and the latest technology. Here’s what’s new and improved in the Nov. 5 release: PwC branding and new homepage design The new and improved homepage features new widgets for Notifications, My Dashboard and News. New Insights tab added to Opportunity pages A new Insights tab on Opportunity pages makes it easy to view Similar Opportunities, Resources and Recommended Actions to help your pursuit. Each of these fields is dynamically populated, based on what you’ve entered in the Opportunity, and will serve up unique information for each Opportunity. Quick-Create and Required-Field Opportunity updates The Quick-Create Opportunity button now appears on Contact pages. Starting an opportunity from a Contact page will automatically add your Contact to the new opportunity. The Required-Field Opportunities button now allows you to enter all Opportunity information in a few quick steps! The new functionality saves you time -- you can now add Team Members, Client Contacts and Product Codes in one easy process. Relationship Management made easier When you synchronize a Contact from Introhive, Salesforce will automatically create a relationship between you and the Contact. A Priority Contact checkbox field has been added to the Contact page -- this allows you to identify strategically important Contacts and track them in Contact Reports and Contact List Views. The Relationship Strength field has been moved to the Relationships section of the Contacts page where each PwC user’s “Relate Me” relationship can be assigned a strength. This update makes it easier for you to view the unique details of each PwC relationship at the account level. New Marketing Activity tab added to Contact and Lead pages Activities run by our marketing team related to a Lead or Contact are now viewable on the new Marketing Activity tab. This tab showcases client contact email clickthroughs, form submissions, and event/webcast registration and attendance. Good to know As part of the Nov. 5 release, a key enhancement will impact the product-related fields and the “behind the scenes” data model. While beneficial in the long run, this improvement to our data model may require you to update your in-app reports or dashboards. To understand the benefits of this move and the reporting impacts, check out this Salesforce Learning &amp; Support Chatter post. Release outage Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, Nov. 2, at 8 p.m. ET to Sunday, Nov. 4, at 2 p.m. ET. Questions? Need help? We’ve got you covered!

Tempting as it may be, the “miscellaneous” expense category should be used only in rare cases -- and often triggers getting your expense report reviewed and either sent for additional approvals or returned for updates. So what’s the solution? Pro tips: Choose the right expense type Our new expense system gives you options for just about any expense type you might need. Before you choose “miscellaneous” -- and potentially put a flag on your report -- check to see if there’s a category you might have missed. Here are some that are often overlooked: In-flight Wifi*: When you’re working in flight, this is your code. Review our policy for expensing wifi, and make sure you categorize it as such. Tips and gratuities: Left a cash tip for hotel housekeeping? This expense type is usually out-of-pocket -- and should stick to a reasonable and customary amount. Training and seminars: If you’re headed to an approved seminar or conference, make sure you choose this expense type. Professional dues and subscriptions: There are two categories to choose from: CPA Related Dues/Subscriptions and Professional Subscriptions/Dues. Travel Documents: Use this expense type for things like getting your visa to travel abroad for work. Looking for an expense type for your latest IT accessory? You are in the wrong place! All IT accessories and peripherals must go through IT Orders. Using your PwC AmEx card for those purchases will raise a flag on your report. *Corporate Finance -- please continue to expense in-flight wifi to the client or G&amp;A code you are using on your expense report. More to know Before you start expensing, watch the Introduction to SAP Concur Expense, available in Vantage. We’ve tackled the most common scenarios to walk you through the step-by-step process in our new system. Refresh yourself on our new travel and expense policies, which went into effect Jan. 1. The new expense system puts compliance up front, so avoid surprises by making sure you’re clear on what’s in -- and out -- of policy. Ready for more pro tips?

You may need to update your BSP account Changes in your personal life? You may need to update your BSP account Ethics &amp; Compliance Oct. 18, 2018 Maintaining your securities in the firm’s Brokerage Simplification Program (BSP) is an ongoing responsibility for anyone required to maintain an Independence Checkpoint portfolio -- for you and your family. If you don’t use Independence Checkpoint, this doesn’t apply to you. Stay mindful of events that can affect your independence and require you to manually update BSP account information, including: Changes to your brokerage account, or if you or someone in your immediate family opens a new brokerage account. If your spouse changes jobs, they’ll need to roll over their 401(k) or other employee benefit plan into an IRA or to their new employer’s plan. Getting married or moving in with a significant other (“spouse equivalent”), meaning their brokerage accounts also need to be recorded in Independence Checkpoint. BSP will not automatically account for these types of changes, so you’ll need to record any new accounts and update revised account numbers to maintain your personal independence. Rollovers must be completed within 90 days, and any new accounts or account number changes must be registered in Independence Checkpoint as soon as possible. Our Ethics &amp; Compliance BSP team is here to help. If you have questions visit BSP on Spark or reach out to the Compliance Resource Center (CRC) -- click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option 5.

Three things you need to know -- or do -- right NOW: Get ready...later this spring we will be releasing a new version of Aura -- “Aura Platinum”. Aura Platinum will be fully on-line enabled with many enhancements, including dramatically improved dashboards and metrics, with visibility across all of your engagements and across multiple tools. Also, remember we will be retiring the local version of Aura in Q4 FY’20 and having good network connectivity at your client site is important. If your team needs assistance to improve client site connectivity, fill out this form and an implementation resource will be in contact. Have questions? Visit the Aura Spark page for FAQs. Connect v2.7 will be retired in July 2019. Connect V3 was released last spring and our engagement teams and clients have benefited from the new features and faster performance. If your team hasn’t transitioned to Connect V3, now is the time! And remember to take advantage of the integration with Aura; by linking your requests in Connect to corresponding EGAs, this will allow your team to easily see when EGA progress may be impeded by overdue requests in the new Aura Platinum. Get started using the Connect v3 Transition Guide and other materials available on Spark.

The proposed rule isn’t public yet, so we’re not sure what it will say. We recognize that this development may create uncertainty and questions for those of you who may be impacted. It may be several months before the final regulation, in whatever form, takes effect, and we won’t know the exact implementation date until USCIS publishes the final rule. If you or your spouse are working on an H-4 EAD, here’s what you can do now: If your case was prepared by an outside immigration attorney, please contact your attorney for further guidance. If your or your spouse’s case was prepared by PwC Law, please reach out to them at PwC.Imm.Law.Applicants@ca.pwc.com to discuss your case. If you would like to speak with the firm’s Immigration Services Team to discuss potential immigration options, please email usimmigration@us.pwc.com or call the HR SSC (see below). If you have any questions about your status, please call the HR SSC at (877) 792-4357, option 4, option 7, then option 3. The Immigration Services team and PwC Law will continue to monitor this situation to provide guidance to those who may be impacted.

The settlement concerns audit work that was done more than 10 years ago at Colonial Bank. At the time our firm was auditor of the bank where several employees committed fraud. I want to answer a couple of questions that may be on your mind. First, we are a firm with an excellent track record for quality. Quality is a top priority for us — and we’re always learning and looking for even more ways to get better. Second, there’s nothing in the settlement that will change how we are investing in your development experience, making our firm more digital, offering meaningful benefits that meet or exceed industry standards and working together as One Firm to deliver the quality and value our clients expect. Last, if others ask you about the settlement, you might wonder what to say. If you are asked about this by a client, please involve the partner you work with to help respond. If you are approached by the media, please direct them without comment to Beth Parker in our external communications group, and please don’t make any comments on social media. And if others ask, you can tell them we don’t comment on client matters. Team, I know it may be hard to see headlines like this about our firm, but there’s nothing about this settlement that will change how we serve our clients, operate our firm or provide opportunities for all of you.

We have a solution. Our new TAP (Targeted Attack Protection) tool warns you when an email contains malicious web links. PwC rolled out this new technology to protect against threats like phishing and targeted attacks. Here’s how TAP works If a link in an email is safe, you’ll see no difference. Malicious links, however, will trigger a notification like the one below. Is it safe? Email may be malicious even when it looks legitimate to the discerning eye. TAP adds another level of protection -- for you, our clients and our firm. But even with TAP on your side, you should still be on the lookout for suspicious communications, and always report them by using the new phish button in your Google Mail side panel or by forwarding to GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com. Our cyber protection strategy starts with each of us. Example: Have you received one of Google’s proactive phishing protection and management control alerts (see image below)? Please report any of these types of warnings to PwC as mentioned above. More information Contact GBL_NIS-E-Mail-Security-EFD-Communications@pwc.com.

Talent Exchange now offers weekly and daily pricing. Rule the rate! Talent Exchange now offers weekly and daily pricing Advisory June 7, 2019 As we discussed last week, new Talent Exchange functionality that will allow you more flexibility in structuring agreements with independent talent is just around the corner. You’ll have the option to offer talent Daily and Weekly rates, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Today, we're spotlighting Daily and Weekly rates. After creating a time-based role, you will have the option to negotiate and extend offers for daily/weekly rates to talent. Take a look at the key benefits and considerations below to learn more! Key Benefits For PwC For Talent Provide better certainty of cost if irregular or extended hours are required to meet delivery needs Can assist in preventing margin erosion Provide consistency of rate Allow flexibility of working hours Key Considerations These new time-based rates will appear on WIPs as hours. (Days are considered to be 8 hours, and weeks 40 hours.) If talent will work across multiple locations in one week for a project, a daily or hourly rate should be used. You will be asked to specify the role payment type during role creation. For time-based roles, the sub-payment type will be limited to "Hourly" during role creation and pricing events. However, you will be able to update and consider daily and weekly rates at the point of offer. Given their work arrangement with MBO Partners, some individuals' talent cards will be marked with "Hourly Projects Only." This means that they can only accept offers for "Hourly" projects. Please do not engage with these talent if you are looking to leverage alternate payment types (e.g., Fixed Price, Daily, Weekly). If you’ve followed along so far, great work!

Take note of these ind On the list for promotion to manager on July 1? Take note of these independence requirements People Team April 23, 2019 Heads up! It’s promotion season. If you’re being considered for promotion to manager, you’ll need to comply with additional independence requirements prior to your promotion effective date of July 1, 2019. Maintaining personal independence is a critical responsibility. We must understand how financial holdings and relationships can impact our clients, the firm and our personal independence. Individuals at the manager level have more independence requirements than senior associates, and you’ll need to have your financial relationships and holdings reviewed for independence before you can be promoted. You’ll have plenty of support, but block time now so you are prepared and can meet all the hard deadlines. Deadline Activity May 31 Complete your Annual Compliance Confirmation (ACC). June 7 Manager Promotion Checklist If you’re a senior associate who was recommended for promotion to manager during Career Roundtable, you’ll be notified on June 3 by your Relationship Leader. You will receive a communication from Hillary Stanley, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, on June 4 and will be required to complete a Manager Promotion Checklist by June 7. You will be asked to provide statements for all brokerage accounts, 401(k)s, and other investments held by you and your spouse/spouse equivalent and dependents. TIP: Start gathering that info now! If you are being considered for promotion, review the New Manager Promotion Clearance site for a detailed timeline of personal independence actions you need to take and resources that are available to assist you. June 13 Complete your LoS promotion requirements, such as Blindspots training, credentialing and other courses June 28 For new managers and above: You should sign a new employment agreement (to be emailed on June 24) by June 28 — prior to the July 4 firmwide shutdown — via Workday for a July 1 promotion effective date. All other staff levels: You will be notified of promotions starting June 3 through June 7. Promotion Day will take place June 21. As you think about your progression to the next level, don't forget to update your TalentLink profile. Keeping your information up to date can help identify opportunities for you that best fit your experience and the skills you'd like to develop. If you have any questions about independence or other promotion requirements, please reach out to the Compliance Resource Center: 1-877-PwC-Help, option 5 (in the US); 1-813-351-6491 (outside the US). All promotions are conditional upon successful compliance of necessary promotion requirements by the appointed deadlines.

Check out this short video to learn how writing personal thank-you cards has fueled her team’s emotional well-being and improved engagement. One of Christine’s personal thank you notes signed by partners. A Boston-based Valuation team created a gratitude wall and encourages colleagues to post at least one sticky-note a week. The wall quickly filled up with various thank-you notes and continues to be a nice reminder of the importance of taking a break and appreciating the people and things that make us happy. These teams found that practicing gratitude reminds them to take a step back from their busy lives to appreciate the people they work with. It puts smiles on faces and has a positive impact on their creativity and productivity. Real-time recognition is coming The wait is almost over. Next month, we will launch our enhanced, tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool. With so many exciting features, it’s never been easier to show appreciation for your colleagues. But don’t wait until the new tool arrives to recognize your colleagues for a job well done. Take these two thank-you note examples or check out these other ideas on how you can recognize others before we launch the new tool. Keep it digital and download this editable card, fill it out and attach it to an email. Note: If you still have recognition dollars to redeem, reference your email with the subject "Real-time recognition award" to access the link and redeem your award by Aug. 31.

They were able to make partner while working a flexible work arrangement (FWA). These formal programs provide predictability and opportunity to help our people bring their whole selves to work, feel valued and a sense of belonging, while being there for their families. We talked with each of them to hear their stories and the lessons they learned. Kristen Conner Kristen began a FWA 15 years ago when returning to work after the birth of her first child. Since then her family has grown, and she has become a partner of the firm. In her own words ... “My story is one of growing your career your own way -- it’s been a unique journey that has been built around the firm providing a non-typical career path for someone who needed exactly that. “An FWA allowed me to have the best of both worlds in pursuing a professional career that keeps me challenged, but also allows me to be actively involved in the lives of my two daughters. The ability to pursue greatness in both roles has been a tremendous blessing. The flexible work arrangement and other programs the firm offers are an invaluable benefit to parents that would be hard to find anywhere else. I could not have achieved all that I have done in my career and as a mother without such programs. “The key is creating an arrangement that is balanced and works for both the firm and you. For example, I maintain additional flexibility for my clients and teams during the busy periods when my clients are more likely to need me. You learn how to make the most out of every minute spent during the working hours for your clients and teams and every moment spent with your family.” Kristy Romo Kristy started a flexible work schedule in 2012 when she made managing director. In this role she could continue her passion for client work while being there for her family. In her own words ... “In my time on an FWA, some years I could take on more and other years I’ve taken a step back. The partners have been a huge support for me as I made my journey from senior manager to managing director and now to partner. They always provided me opportunities to continue to learn and grow. If anything, the FWA has allowed me to stay at the firm and to continue to contribute. “The most important lesson I learned on my journey is that you are never alone – whether professionally or personally. There are times when you may think you are but you really are not. Communicate and communicate often. I find that whether you are on an FWA or not, communication solves most problems.” Victoria Brennan Victoria, a mother of four, started on an FWA after relocating from New Jersey to Baltimore. After commuting for three years, she finally moved her family to Baltimore and went to an 80% to 90% schedule to help transition her family. In her own words ... “Every time I reached a crossroads in my career path and talked to people who guided me, it always brought a different perspective. My mentors helped me think about what’s important to me and what challenges me, and, ultimately, what do I want. “I had a misguided internal fear that if I didn’t commit 100% of my time to work I would miss opportunities. Along the way, my mentors discouraged me from giving up, and we came up with unconventional ways to solve the issues. I figured out, you’re 100% in on 90% of the work. “You meet so many people throughout your career -- the biggest thing is to connect with them. If you communicate and trust those who support and guide you, you will find the right way. It might not be what you thought, but trust in the support around you.” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/37926.html</url><pwc_title>How will you say “thanks” today? 3 tips from Tax </pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:54:42</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:Tax|source:Tax</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description> Saying thank you can go a long way.

But it’s not just what we give in thanks, it’s how we give it — here are three great suggestions: I think it's most meaningful to thank people in real time, whether that’s through RTR, a quick note or in person. There's nothing more important than acknowledging the caring that our people put into their day-to-day actions -- whether that means how they support their teams, create value for clients, or contribute to their community. - John Buchanan, Tax Managing Partner I like to recognize my fellow team members not only by issuing Real-time Recognition, but also by letting the manager/director/partner on the account know when a fellow team member does a great job. - Jacky Roznik, Tax Staff Advisory Council Alumna I believe it is important to get to know my team so I can be thoughtful about the type and level of appreciation that is appropriate and meaningful. The easiest way to show appreciation is to say thank you. I also believe that it is important to recognize when someone is making an effort. - Nodira Nosirjonovna Ismoilova, Tax Staff Advisory Council Looking for more ideas on how to approach recognition?

This week I am incredibly honored to host a webcast with leading voices on gender equity. Today is International Women's Day, and I'll be speaking to Working Mother President Subha Barry, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistRonan Farrow and HeForShe founder Elizabeth Nyamayaro about issues that matter to all of us. This is a continuation of the discussions we've been having as a firm and within our teams. Both inside and outside PwC, we've seen how change happens when we take on tough topics. On today’s webcast, we’ll talk about some of these changes — from the impact of the #MeToo movement, to trends in family care leave and the actions that organizations are taking to close the gender leadership gap. Team, I am humbled to represent all of you — and to learn from these three individuals. Elizabeth founded HeForShe as a way for men to stand as allies and speak up for gender equity. Ronan’s reporting in the New Yorker was instrumental in launching #MeToo. Subha brings 30 years of front-line business and leadership experience to the table. They have incredible experiences to share and I hope this conversation creates another opportunity for discussions inside PwC. Similar to when we've talked about race, inclusion and other topics, this is an opportunity for us to share our own experiences, listen to others and understand each other better. I know we all have different client demands and responsibilities — so we'll record the webcast so you can watch later on your own or with your team. I also have one other ask. As a firm, we have been a champion of HeForShe since its founding and have invited everyone to learn more and make a commitment. We are working toward a global goal of 80,000 commitments from PwC men. We only need 5,800 more to join us and we’ll meet our goal in the U.S. I hope you’ll join me in supporting HeForShe — click here to make your commitment. I’m looking forward to the discussion — I hope you can join us.

It’s important to give and receive it wisely People Team Sept. 4, 2018 High-performing teams continuously give each other feedback and assess their progress. By design, our real-time development culture supports these behaviors, and our tech-enabled tools make it easy to give feedback to each other. Gain insight into your progression and impact through Snapshots We’re four months into the performance year. Mid-year coaching discussions are right around the corner, so now is the time to initiate and complete snapshots. Snapshots are your opportunity to get a point-in-time assessment of your progress against the PwC Professional framework and any differentiated impact you’ve had. It’s important that you capture this data throughout the year, so don’t delay. As a reminder, you should receive 6-12 Snapshots, covering 80% of your total hours worked during the performance year. You can add these reminders to your calendar (as appropriate): Sept. 28, Oct. 31, Dec. 21, Feb.28, Mar. 29, Apr. 16. Start, stop, or continue with upward and peer feedback As part of our Your Tomorrow journey, we’ve added upward and peer feedback in Workday as one of our real-time development tools. Through Workday, you can give, receive or request feedback with anyone in the global network. The tool provides an ideal opportunity to offer specific suggestions for behaviors -- what your colleague might stop, start, or continue to do in order to have greater impact. More points to consider: Use of the tool is optional. The purpose of is development, not evaluation. Completed feedback is immediately viewable by recipients, their Development Team, and their Talent Consultant/HR Professional. Upward and peer feedback does not replace our primary emphasis -- in-the-moment, on-the-job, real-time development conversations. We expect all feedback and language to be constructive and consistent with our values, Code of Conduct, and behaviors of a PwC Professional. Put yourself in the shoes of a recipient. Always use a constructive tone, and remember that our collective goal is to help one another grow and develop. For more information, review our guidance on how to use upward and peer feedback, including examples of well-written and poorly written feedback.

Our "Upskilling in Action" series celebrates the successes of some of your colleagues who are accelerating their digital skills and applying them on their projects and with their clients. On most days, William VanBuskirk, an Advisory experienced associate and Digital Accelerator based in Chicago, uses data visualization tools to synthesize information and present it in a visual and more impactful way. While with a client who was preparing for a major enterprise-wide digital transformation, he was tasked with finding a way to translate massive amounts of data into something meaningful. William worked hand-in-hand with the client to understand relevant use cases for visualizing their next generation of architecture across the enterprise and developed an analytics and visualization approach. Digital visualizations and recommendations were new capabilities to the client, so he drove digital adoption and sustainability by coaching the client analysts on how to perform the work themselves. William also helped his PwC team build their digital skills by sharing some of his Digital Accelerator learnings. By walking the client through demonstrations and examples that exhibit the value and possibilities of augmenting their work, William and his team built the client’s trust. This led to the implementation of the new dashboard and increased data transparency for the client. The client also greatly valued the ability to easily maintain the dashboard. Jimmy Lee, William’s director, summed it up best. “William takes the ‘magic’ out of going digital, and makes using new technologies and tools practical and approachable to his colleagues and clients.” William encourages everyone to check out all the digital learning content available in the Digital Hub — “Even if you only have an hour a week, you can learn so much in that time.” Want to build your own digital skills? A good place to start is the Digital Hub, the home to all things Digital Upskilling — available on PC and mobile via the Digital Hub app in PwC’s App Store. You’ll find pre-reads to get ready for PowerUp! games, Learning Bursts, Tech While You Trek podcasts, Digital Quests and more. And don’t forget our FY19 Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal for everyone at PwC — earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests on or before June 30, 2019. As an added incentive, get an early start through Learn2earn by completing all four Digital Quests and earning a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points before April 30 and you’ll be entered for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win!

In 2018, UPS launched a bold initiative called the One Procurement Transformation. This initiative was tasked with delivering $1B in benefits by 2021 and developing global world-class procurement capabilities across UPS. The ability to rapidly deploy S2P (Source to Pay) globally to address $21B in spend and support 70 thousand users worldwide is a critical enabler. What was our solution for UPS? We worked closely with the UPS Procurement Leadership team to develop a roadmap to successfully deploy S2P globally. The initiative was mobilized with our Source to Pay (S2P) Integrated Solution, and the best of both management and technology consulting to provide UPS with an end-to-end solution. We continued to build momentum with them by developing the future operating model, updating procurement policies, driving the S2P tool selection RFP, and developing a self-funding roadmap to deploy S2P globally in a measured, accelerated manner. We leveraged the Source to Pay integrated solution playbook to show UPS how we will solve the challenge of working on detailed design, operating model development, process redesign, tool selection, implementation, and deployment. UPS could clearly see the journey they were about to take and felt confident in our ability to deliver. Additionally, a set of tools from our Fit for Growth (FFG) toolkit demonstrated to UPS that we will deliver in a unique, more efficient manner. What results will UPS see using our solution? $1B in ROI benefits by 2021. Additional $260M from process, compliance and tool related improvements, providing a strong ROI on the effort and making it self-funded. Increase in purchasing compliance, reduction in the audit risk, and establishing a best-in-class procurement organization. What was significant about this win, what does it mean for us? A potential to achieve a 38% margin. Use case scenarios of utilizing Your Tomorrow digital assets at a client engagement. Demonstration of our Fit for Growth Platform value proposition - helping clients create an environment for change to happen and culture to evolve as they prepare for a faster moving and unpredictable future.

Data Sieve for Leasing uses Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing to extract key terms from lease agreements in your audit sample, resulting in a digitized version of each lease and an Excel extract of key lease terms and clauses that can be quickly and easily reviewed. How does it benefit me? Through automation, the tool lowers the risk of manual error and allows you to easily view, filter, and search for lease terms all in one place, allowing you more time to focus on areas that require accounting judgment. We have used this tool successfully in many non-audit applications; its use in the audit channel is an exciting development in the Tech Enabled Audit, part of our Your Tomorrow strategy. How can my team get started using it? There are a few things to know: If your team elects to use Data Sieve, you will be required to use the SDC to assist with setup and processing of the leases within the tool. Data Sieve for Leasing is most appropriate for audit engagements where the audit client is the lessee, with over 30 leases in the audit sample. To determine if your engagement is eligible to use the tool, click here. The central team will help you determine if your engagement is a good fit. ASC 842 Adoption Calculator in Template Manager is an Excel-based tool that calculates the lease liability and right-of-use asset balances at the application date of ASC 842 of each lease in your sample. Here’s how it can help you: Clearly shows key data inputs for ease of comparison to client information Allows for standard documentation over the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset The tool is for internal use only. You can download the Calculator from Template Manager; you’ll find it under PwC Audit Practice Aids --&gt; General Assurance. Questions?

But for students to learn, educators first need to feel comfortable embracing these new technologies. This is a challenge we’re familiar with. Last year, 50,000 of us used the Digital Fitness app to assess our skills and identify areas for growth. It was such a valuable tool that, with the support of the firm, the PwC Charitable Foundation funded the creation of a customized version for educators, in support of our Access Your Potential initiative. This week, we shared the app with tens of thousands of teachers in the DonorsChoose.org network. Just like our people, educators begin by completing a digital assessment. Based on their individual results, they'll receive curated resources to help them get comfortable with tech concepts from AI to blockchain to coding. Building educators’ confidence According to a study we recently conducted, only 10% of K–12 teachers surveyed nationally feel confident incorporating higher-level technology, like coding and data analytics, into student learning. This uncertainty is even more acute in low-income school districts that lack funding for additional teacher training, putting their students at a further disadvantage — one of the many gaps in opportunity that keep these students from being prepared for the millions of available technology jobs. Well-prepared teachers can ignite a spark of interest in students by showing them the possibilities of technology — the “wow” of what’s to come, along with what it will take to get there. That spark is only possible if teachers understand technology and how to translate it into real-world terms that students can get excited about. This is who we are: a purpose-driven organization that invests in elevating society, our people and our clients. Share, share, share! Now that this version of the app is live, check it out and send along* to educators you know who might be interested. Digital Fitness for educators is just one way we’re helping meet teachers’ needs as we work together to get young people excited about technology. As Shannon Schuyler, our Chief Purpose Officer and Responsible Business Leader, says in a new blog post: “We need young people to become passionate about learning to code or designing an app because their livelihoods depend on it.” This is a critical mission, and it’s going to take all of us — educators, parents and the private sector — to make it happen. *Please use Internet Explorer to open the Google Play link.

FLEX your scheduling and budgeting muscles -- or mi Want strong teams? FLEX your scheduling and budgeting muscles -- or miss out on staffing your engagements! Tax Sept. 10, 2018 To continuously improve and streamline our Tax processes, FlexForecast (FLEX) is now the primary tool for busy season planning. As your single point of entry for budgeting and engagement change requests, FLEX will save time and reduce duplication of work. The final national deadline for Tax is to have FLEX budgets created and sent to Deployment by October 31. FLEX budgets should be created for all engagements that expect to incur 20 hours or more. Creating a FLEX budget ensures all known engagements are appropriately staffed and resource needs are identified. Note that this deadline should not override any earlier market specific deadlines set by your deployment consultant. Here’s how it works: 1. Go to Rapid Engage and search for the Opportunity name that you will create a budget for. Click “Budget” then “Complete the budget in FlexForecast” to begin. While going through Rapid Engage is optional, there are many benefits. Information like engagement leader, product code and fee amount will flow directly from Salesforce to the new budget and the Rapid Engage tracker will be linked to your budget. 2. Create FLEX budget. Important: Coordinate with other teams collaborating on a given engagement letter (contract) to populate ONE engagement budget with a tab for each project team (ex: 2018 Compliance including tabs for Fed, State and ITS). 3. Populate your expected team members and hours. Estimate expected fees to ensure resulting margin and IPR meet our targets. Indicate timing of hours in the Weekly Staffing tab. Important: Ensure that all staffing needs are accounted for -- including any unknown or TBD resources that the Deployment Community is still working on staffing. Additionally if a staff member has not been confirmed by Deployment, a TBD should be entered into FLEX. Please be sure to appropriately allocate hours by week for each staff member. The weekly hours in FLEX will be used to populate schedules in TalentLink. 4. By October 31, click “Send to Deployment” to submit the schedule to TalentLink. You may update your budget later if changes are necessary based on engagement letter negotiations. Once a FLEX budget is submitted, our Deployment Enablement Team will update TalentLink, and the Deployment Consultants will work through upcoming scheduling. If the engagement terms are not yet final, you do not need to finalize the budget at this time. You may update your budget later if changes are necessary before the work begins. 5. Work with Deployment to confirm staffing requests, and update FLEX budget as needed. 6. Finalize your budget once fees are agreed to and you are ready to open your WBS code(s). Any staffing hours updates not previously submitted will automatically be sent to Deployment. Finance/Leadership Review is required if IPR &lt; 80% and EM &lt; 40%, before the budget will be finalized. Don’t forget: FLEX is for more than just WBS code opening. Staffing has a direct impact on engagement economics. To ensure the economic impact of staffing decisions is considered and to minimize the duplication of efforts, FLEX is the single point of entry for engagement teams to make staffing updates. Changes made in FLEX will be pushed to TalentLink.

Who’s inspiring you in a unique way? Help us tell their #TeamPwC story! Reach out with your “We are IFS” story ideas. Laphil Bowles, a Finance manager in the Tampa office, understands the importance of getting a head start. As a student, she participated in the Academy of Finance, a national program sponsored by the nonprofit National Academy Foundation, that prepares high school students for college and a career in finance. “It was a life changer for me,” Laphil says. “A career in accounting never sparked my interest simply because of the unknown -- but the Academy quickly changed that. I credit them with expanding my career opportunities and paving the way to my future passion!” Laphil’s experience with the Academy of Finance ignited a successful career path and a commitment to opening up similar opportunities for students who, like her, might not otherwise consider a future in finance. Laphil serves on the Hillsborough County Academy of Finance Advisory Board, letting her shine as a true champion for the students. Her enthusiasm for the program has been contagious! Laphil coordinates PwC Tampa colleagues who volunteer to help students foster leadership skills, facilitate mock job interviews and judge competitions -- local students compete up to the national level. “PwCers are beacons for these students,” says Laphil. “It’s gratifying to see so many of my teammates embracing this commitment to building a solid future for our youth.” The program itself is rigorous. On top of the students’ normal curriculum, the Academy of Finance offers students a variety of opportunities to network with local business professionals to develop leadership skills. “They can earn college credits and honor points toward their GPA, and the experience often leads to scholarships and internships,” explains Laphil. “We love giving tours of the Tampa office and giving students a glimpse of what a career at PwC could look like. Our people help these students see exciting options for their future.” The Academy of Finance is also aligned with PwC’s Access Your Potential, our commitment to equipping diverse students with the skills they need to succeed in the future. “Today’s high school students need an advocate, someone to model a path for the future and help lay the groundwork for them to get there,” says Laphil. “I know the importance of this program first hand and I’m so proud that PwC sees the value in caring for the future of both our local students and our profession.” PwC volunteers gather to judge an Academy of Finance student competition.

This automation saves time and reduces error risk How ‘bot that? This automation saves time and reduces error risk HQ News April 12, 2019 Reducing repetitive tasks and the risk of human error would be a win for any team. On a recent engagement, the Deals - Capital Markets and Accounting Advisory Services (CMAAS) practice’s Project Greyhound team did just that! While working with a non-audit Blackstone (global priority account)-sponsored portfolio client in connection with its planned initial public offering (IPO), the team found that the client was manually updating over 250 disclosures every time a valuation assumption changed. The team used their newly acquired digital skills to help their client automate the process. They were initially working with the client’s semi-structured data in Excel that was not machine readable, so the first step to automating the process was to structure the data. To do this, they brought the client’s data into Google Sheets and structured it into a flat file by creating a flat tracker next to the disclosures on a number of worksheets throughout the workbook. Once the data was in a machine-readable format, the team, led by Digital Accelerator Anthony Sabatino, built a bot using UiPath Studio that automatically transcribed the data from the Google Sheet into a PDF. The bot, which took about 10 hours to build, took a process that would have normally taken two to three hours manually and shortened it to less than five minutes. The process is typically repeated eight to 10 times on a planned IPO offering resulting in a time savings of 16 to 30 hours. Using the bot also significantly reduces the risk of human error from copying data from one place to another. “Our success can definitely be attributed to the tremendous support we received from the account and firm leadership and our team’s willingness to try something new,” Anthony said. “Everyone is fascinated with the endless possibilities these digital tools provide.” The team’s client and other working party members (counsel, private equity sponsor and underwriters) were very happy with the outcome. They saw the value in the team automating the process so they could focus their time on other tasks. And their bot, Find and Replace PDF Comments, has been approved on Digital Lab and is currently being used by other teams. Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Michael McHugh, Anthony Sabatino and Ryan VanDagens Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40141.html</url><pwc_title>PowerUp! will PowerDown … for now — get ready for the June 14 season finale</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-14 01:50:09</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>source:HQ News</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-05-16 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:HQ News</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>PowerUp! will PowerDown … for now — get ready for the June 14 season f PowerUp! will PowerDown … for now — get ready for the June 14 season finale HQ News May 16, 2019 Throughout FY19, we’ve been engaging in new and unique ways to build our digital skills, with the ultimate goal of all PwCers completing the four Digital Quests and earning their Digital Acumen knowledge badges.

What does this mean for me? When you submit a record for storage, the hard copy will be sent to a central, secure, offsite storage facility. When you request retrieval of a stored record, you’ll now receive it in digital format only, which improves security and controls over our client information. Once a record is digitized, it will be available almost immediately when you request it. However, be aware it could take up to five business hours for scanning and delivery the first time a stored file is requested. Records from engagements ending prior to 2016 will still be delivered in a physical format within two business days. You’ll still use RMS, our Records Management system, to submit external hard copy records for storage and to request stored records when you need them. Your local Office Services staff will still be on hand to help ensure all records are “checked-in” in compliance with our policies. We’re excited about the improved efficiency, control and security we’ll get with centralized records storage and digital delivery. If you have questions or need support adjusting to the new digitized records, please reach out to your local Office Services Manager.

Advisory April 22, 2019 What was the challenge ScanSource asked us to solve? Their business units operated in product silos, limiting the organization from effectively selling and servicing the full product portfolio across their client base. To adapt, ScanSource had a need to build a single sales organization, standardize roles and processes, incentivize sellers, innovate new solution offerings for the marketplace, and implement technology to support this journey. What was our solution for ScanSource? We defined a new Go-to-Market (GTM) model for ScanSource by re-segmenting their customer base, re-structuring their sales organization and re-designing sales compensation and territory model. To put the new GTM model into action, we leveraged our Sales and Marketing Excellence (S&amp;ME) Integrated Solution. S&amp;ME supports our Fit for Growth platform goal of fostering an environment for change to occur and culture to evolve. This goal is achieved by standardizing business processes, reducing manual handoffs across customer teams, and improving collaboration around customer needs. In a nutshell, we won ScanSouce because we... Differentiated ourselves by showcasing our Sales &amp; Marketing Excellence Integrated Solution, which is infused with ‘out-of-the-box’ best practices that would largely meet ScanSource’s needs in an efficient and best-in-class manner. Challenged the normal assumptions made in the design phase of such large transformations, and pushed boundaries to come up with a best-in-class solution for each business unit without over analyzing the current state. Leveraged Salesforce and UX resources from the Global Firm, specifically Poland and Canada, and Assurance resources for risks and controls assessment. Used an xLoS approach, by leveraging SDC, DIAC and third-party labor, which proved that we are better together versus in our organizational silos. Made change fun and exciting through gamification, sneak peak sessions, and multiple modes of training and help resources. What results will ScanSource see using our solution? Major shifts to operational, sales and performance metrics... Increase in: volume and quality of leads cross-sell and up-selling deal volume improved operating income collaboration and transparency Decrease in: case to resolution cycle time technical debt sales cycle time ….all leading to enhanced shareholder value. How is this win significant and what results will we see? Delivered with unprecedented margin of 41%, as a result of our accelerators, team and Global Firm staffing structure. A competitive showcase and compelling reference for future use. Highlights significant strides made with xLoS collaboration. Meet the team!

Some of our recent inclusion efforts include the 4REAL Blindspot training (firmwide), Coaching with an Inclusive Mindset training (senior associates and above), and the Inclusive Leadership and Belonging training (manager and above) taking place this week. Another way we execute the strategy is through our D&amp;I leadership development experiences. This fall, the Office of Diversity hosted five D&amp;I signature experiences for more than 600 of our minority and female professionals: Vanguard (Black/African American associates), Navigate Success (Hispanic/Latino associates), Accelerate (Pan-Asian associates), Diamond (underrepresented minority directors/senior managers) and Breakthrough Leadership (female directors/senior managers). Vanguard, our longest running D&amp;I signature leadership program, celebrated its 10th anniversary in Dallas this year with the theme “Be a part of the legacy.” Program alumni and various leaders, including several USLT members, shared their perspective on leadership and participated in an especially meaningful tribute in memory of our colleague Botham Jean, a 2016 Vanguard alum. Check out this video highlighting the 10 year journey of the Vanguard program. How can you help build a more inclusive culture? Ask about the experience. If you know a colleague who attended one of these programs this fall, ask them to share the experience with you -- it’s an opportunity to keep the conversation going and to foster a more inclusive culture. Reach out to your Market Diversity Leader to learn more about how you can get involved with other diversity and inclusion efforts. Consider joining an Inclusion Network to get involved, support and learn more! Why do we host D&amp;I leadership programs? Our D&amp;I leadership development programs are a part of the firm’s effort to help develop, advance and create a sense of inclusion for all of our professionals as we remain committed to maintaining a robust and diverse talent pipeline. Each program continues to build on the success of the attendees, and often gives them exposure to leaders with similar cultural backgrounds. “Bringing our complete selves to PwC will strengthen our innovative capacity, unleash the potential of our employees and thereby directly contribute to our purpose,” said Vikram Panjwani, Accelerate Partner Champion. More than 200 partners, senior managers, directors and human capital professionals joined the learners on these intense program journeys to share their experiences. In the spring, Select Senior will take a similar approach to enhancing our inclusive leadership culture as our leadership development program for diverse, high-potential senior associates. “These experiences encourage participants to embrace who they are and realize the value they bring to PwC. I am proud to have been part of Navigate Success, which helps advance and retain the amazing diverse talent we have at PwC,” said Gabe Alejandro, Navigate Success Partner Champion.

The network consists of more than 2,000 professionals and shares one vision: to be the leading advisor to clients facing moments of exceptional change in a digital world. Our goal as a global CMAAS business is to drive growth across the network at a rate of more than 15% per year, growing our revenue to $2B by 2023. The network is led by a global leadership team (GLT) comprised of seven territory leaders who have been tasked to develop the strategy and objectives to meet our goal. FY19 Objectives Last month, the GLT, along with other CMAAS leaders from around the world, met in London to discuss the global CMAAS vision. Our FY19 objectives center around five initiatives: being market focused, branding, deals alignment, disruption and upskilling our people. These objectives align with the US strategy and cover all aspects of our business. What’s Next The territories have been asked to focus on four key strategic solutions: Capital Raising, Divestitures, Acquisitions and Accounting Change (including Leases, Insurance and Finance of the Future). In the US, we are delivering on these solutions and are well positioned to contribute to global efforts. We’ll begin sharing our knowledge and experience with teams across the network via Kate Dahlberg on Divestitures, Emily Kirsch on Acquisitions and Nicole Yuan broadly on Disruption/Technology. Keep checking your myKcurve newsfeed for global CMAAS updates and the latest developments on how we're achieving our FY19 objectives.

Lab notes: Save time by automating common tasks — plus Learn2earn! HQ News Jan. 15, 2019 Through Digital Lab, our Gateway to Your Tomorrow, our people are driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. This “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope their stories inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. If you could change one thing that you spend too much time doing during a project, what would it be? For Senior Associates Sarah Handley and Nara Yoon in the Private Company Services (PCS) Assurance group, that one thing drove them to create and submit multiple time-saving automations to Digital Lab. Inspired by what they learned in Digital Academies and encouraged to upskill and create automations as part of the PCS Innovation Competition, in which Sarah and Nara were the first and third place automation contributor winners, both took a hard look at what could be automated to make their jobs more efficient. (Haven’t attended a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion session yet? Find out more here.) Here’s how some of their automations are helping to save time while maintaining quality on audits: Alteryx workflows clean up client files so that unessential data and empty cells are removed, making them usable by PwC: The SAP AP Ledger Cleaner cleanses data and then applies the vendor ID and company name to each invoice within an AP subledger file. The SAP FI-Material- Valuation Report Cleanser cleanses data and then applies a location ID and material type ID to each inventory item within a SAP Inventory Valuation Report. The Confirmation.com Extract automation, which pulls relevant information from confirmation.com, cleanses the formatting, and builds a table of information that can help teams reconcile client trial balances. For a leasing company client, the operating lease table buildout workflow builds out a rent expense and deferred rent table for an individual operating lease, which can help teams recalculate rent expenses and deferred/accrued rent balances. “I was looking for a way to automate tasks and make it easier for staff — instead of having to go page by page and writing out all the details,” explained Nara. “With this [confirmation.com] workflow, you can focus more on auditing and confirming the balances are right instead of spending all that time on data gathering.” When Sarah and Nara needed assistance with these and other workflows, they found fellow Digital Academy attendees, the Digital Lab review team, and Digital Accelerators to be very helpful in answering questions and providing perspective on solutions. “When developing automations, it really helps to collaborate with others — including your team members or Digital Accelerators — because the end results will be significantly better than if you try to go it alone,” said Sarah. Sarah’s advice for others: Keep an eye out for opportunities to automate. “In PCS NY Metro, we’ve already asked everyone to think about the pain points you experience as you work on audits. This will help identify things we can automate to help us all,” she said.

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. When Deisi Alcantar joined PwC in July 2018 as an associate in the State and Local Tax financial services group, she recognized the potential impact that digital tools like Alteryx, Tableau and UiPath would have in her work. Although she and her team didn’t have prior experience with them, she was ready to learn and use the tools -- even if it meant teaching herself. Fast-forward six months: Deisi played a key role in creating several visuals for a client, showing year-over-year savings and delineating states that generated the most notices in the US. Data visualization of state by state savings. “The client was quickly impressed and excited to have these visualizations, as they often struggle to articulate facts to the main office and get push-back on engaging us to do the work,” said Caragh Deluca, Tax partner in Financial Services. It was a win for the team and a value-add for the client. Deisi’s learning journey with technology tools involved firm resources, trial and error and open communication with her team. In-person trainings (Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion sessions you can register for in Vantage) and the Digital Hub menu of options (Tech While You Trek podcasts, Learning Bursts, PowerUp! and more) help to upskill and stay up-to-date on the latest technology. Plus, conversations with her engagement team helped her focus and keep the bigger picture in mind. Before presenting to the client, she and her engagement team practiced with a mock meeting. “The engagement team and I played around with the different settings and filters,” said Deisi. “The end product was a visual story we were excited to share with the client.” A professional development opportunity Learning data visualization tools changed how Deisi and her engagement team worked with the client -- and enhanced her own digital knowledge and skills in the process. “If I hadn’t worked on data visualization, I wouldn’t have been able to see these trends,” said Deisi. “I was able to be more proactive helping the team meet the needs of our client.” It wasn’t always easy, but the experience has made a difference in her career. Deisi continues to learn new tools in Digital Lab, checking it at least once a week to see what’s new and to see what she or her team can use. As we use our technology tools on engagements and tell our digital story, it is important to remember our absolute commitment to independence. To avoid perceptions that PwC may be promoting or endorsing any one company, tool or product over another, do not to mention our clients, vendors or specific products or services by name or share client-specific data or visualizations.

After proudly serving 10 years active duty in the Navy, Corbin sought to make a career transition. Life at sea as a Surface Warfare Officer was no longer conducive to his family life. With a wife and (now) four kids, Corbin wanted to anchor home. But like many veterans, translating extensive military experience to the corporate world was an arduous task. Knowing he had an interest working in technology, a friend suggested Corbin check out PwC’s career page. There he found veteran resources and contacts that led him to a cybersecurity job at the firm. Today, in an effort to pay it forward and help other veterans, Corbin has become an active member of the firm’s Veterans Affinity Network (VAN) and voluntarily leads veteran recruiting efforts for cybersecurity professionals. “The ability to relate to your colleagues is important,” Corbin said. “I feel supported by the vast network of fellow veterans. I’m also pleased by the support we provide reservists and their families. I know firsthand the challenges imposed by military service on a person’s work/life balance. The flexibility we offer makes it easier on our staff and their families.” How PwC helps veterans belong We bring our values to life by attracting, developing and helping veterans, service members and military spouses succeed in the workforce and feel a sense of belonging. Some examples of our commitment include: Joining Google to host a day dedicated to the advancement of military veterans, service-members and their families. Encouraging PwCers to support veteran causes through Impact Space. PwC Charitable Foundation committing $10 million to assist more than 200,000 veterans and their children in overcoming barriers faced in education and career transition. "As a veteran myself, I fully appreciate the sacrifices and contributions all of our veterans have made,” said Tim Stoner, partner champion for our Veterans Affinity Network. “On Veterans Day and throughout the year, we say thank you to all veterans and their families." Note: Stay tuned for the latest episode of Well, Well, Well launching Monday, Nov. 12 on the PwC Podcast app. Host Cecilia Tse interviews Marine Corps veteran and Manager Joshua Hartley to discuss veteran wellness challenges. Following an old navy tradition, Corbin and his wife baptized their oldest daughter onboard a ship.

You think you’re OK from an independence perspective because you’re not providing audit services. But there are steps to take before you can be sure. Before you begin work on this client, you need to verify whether you have a financial relationship with this client OR any of its affiliates. Here are two actions you should take to avoid an independence exception: 1. Check the restriction status of the client. Search for the entity in the Central Entity Service (CES). Note whether there is a red X (restricted) or green check (unrestricted) associated with the entity. If there is a red X, your client is a restricted entity and you need to know if you have a relationship that would cause an independence issue. Move on to the next step below. 2. Review your financial relationships (investments and other financial arrangements) . If your client is a restricted entity, go to the Compliance tab of the entity in CES and download the Investment Independence List for a full list of entities that require review. If you have an investment in any of the entities on that list, you cannot provide 10 or more hours of non-audit services to the client. If you have an “Other Financial Arrangement” (e.g., bank account, loan, insurance policy) with an entity on the list, contact the Compliance Resource Center for guidance if you aren’t familiar with the respective policies. It may be permissible to keep the arrangement with certain caveats detailed in US Independence Policy. In the event that you would provide audit services, you would not be able to charge even one hour to the engagement while holding an investment in an entity on that list. Remember, independence rules also apply to your immediate family. If you have a spouse or spouse equivalent and/or dependents, the same independence rules that apply to you also apply to them. Have questions or need help? Be proactive and use the PwC personal independence tools available to you. For specific personal independence questions, contact the Compliance Resource Center (CRC) -- click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option 5 inside the US or from outside the US call 1-813-351-6491.

I’ve heard from PwC colleagues inside and outside the US who are feeling this very personally because they feel a connection to Areeb through our firm, through his faith, or through their connection to the region or to Areeb’s home country of Pakistan. Some of you have asked how we can share our sympathies or help in some way. If you have colleagues in our firm in New Zealand, please reach out and share your support. The local leadership team in New Zealand is working with Areeb’s family to determine how how we can collectively contribute. We have also created a page in our Giving site to let you support organizations responding to the violence in New Zealand. Team, I believe most of us want a world where we can live, worship and pursue our goals and dreams without fear. It’s only a very small group of people that cause so much pain and fear. With these terrible acts, I feel even more passionately that we must continue to stand for respect, for understanding and for having empathy for those who are different from us. This means living our values each day within PwC. It also means leading by example and asking others to join us. Just a couple of months ago, we honored Bo Jean by bringing over 150 companies together to have open conversations about race, bias and differences — and to understand the fears that our diverse colleagues live with each day. No one company, government or group can solve this alone, but we have to continue leading the way on this and doing our part as individuals and as a firm. Team, let’s remember all those who are hurting today — and especially Areeb’s family. And remember, we don’t know how these events may be affecting others around us — so please take extra care with each other and, when you ask others how they are doing, be ready to listen.

The next step on our multi-year journey in how we use data is putting in place guidance to help us all become active participants in managing the data lifecycle. So, on Nov. 1, 2019, we’ll implement a new Google data retention policy and apply retention periods to our active email system (Google Mail), our retiring email system (Lotus Notes) and other non-record data (including the entire G Suite). This is a change for G Suite but does not impact our existing records retention policies and requirements, which should continue to be top of mind as we make this transition. What to expect Beginning Nov. 1, 2019, our policy will be to*: Automatically delete emails (both Google Mail and Lotus Notes) that are older than 18 months. (So on Nov. 1, your mailbox will only have emails dated after May 1, 2018.) Automatically delete files in Google My Drive which have a “last modified” date older than 36 months. *Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold. Read more on what that means and check to see if you are subject to an OGC Legal Hold. Automated deletion is also coming for other Google apps — similar to how Google Mail trash, Google Chat (direct and group messages) and Chat Rooms are automatically deleted today. For the Tax practice, there will be a Tax-specific approach to the document retention process. Additional guidance and protocols will be shared separately in the near term. Additionally, the Chief Data Office is working with key functions to ensure processes and functionality are in place to manage retention requirements. What do I need to do to prepare? We all have a responsibility to be active participants in managing the data lifecycle. A “keep everything forever” mindset creates risk and quickly leads to unmanageable volumes of data. Get comfortable thinking critically about what’s important for us to keep and what’s not — and ensure that what should be kept is moved to our systems of record. Confirm you are following existing guidance on appropriate collaboration tools for sharing files and for retaining records and storing non-record data. Any client or project information — including email — that needs to be retained must be stored in the appropriate record repository and/or approved collaboration space for that client. Visit the Data Remediation@PwC page for helpful resources, including information on what’s important for us to keep (record data), and what’s not (non-record data). But wait … I’ve got important stuff in Google Mail and My Drive! We’ve outlined these steps to help you appropriately retain any information in G Suite that holds business value (check here for help with doing the same in Lotus Notes). More to know The way we approach data as a firm is changing. As part of a multi-year data journey, we’ve implemented robust, modern systems for retaining and managing records and for collaboration. At the same time, we’re retiring outdated data storage systems; deleting redundant, obsolete and trivial data; and implementing guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle.

This team has all the right moves Ain’t no stopping them now! This team has all the right moves People Team Aug. 23, 2018 Feeling great is infectious. Just ask our Florham Park, NJ-based Johnson &amp; Johnson Engagement Team. The team's commitment to healthy habits and Be well, work well, has everyone feeling great. And with the launch of our new Well-Being Rewards Program, they are taking healthy habits to another level. Senior Manager Christina Le shared, “Johnson &amp; Johnson heavily promotes Wellness Wednesdays. At 3 p.m., all their staff take a walk and we join in too. They also offer fresh fruit each morning.” She added, “Because we’re at the client site every day, we’ve been focused on our wellness and have made a commitment to new habits.” The team walks to the cafeteria to fill up their water bottles, and they keep healthy snacks on hand. They don’t use the elevators, taking the three flights of stairs at all times. Walking meetings take place regularly, often including the client. On Fridays, the team walks to a restaurant for lunch. An app to track Our Well-Being Rewards Program launched through our new vendor, Virgin Pulse. An added feature: partners now can join the program with staff. Leading by example, Engagement Team Partner Gerry Flynn was the first to download the app. In a Monday morning email to the team, Gerry encouraged them to activate their accounts. “It’s easy to get points right away – just for inviting colleagues,” he said. “Once they signed up, I created a step challenge and invited them to participate.” Now they have at least two challenges each week – Weekend Rumble and the Weekday Step-off (found under “Create a Personal Challenge” in the Virgin Pulse app). The team has 75 members across the US. So far, 25 have joined the challenges. Experienced Associate Niki Patel said, “We were impressed with how easy it was to pair our phones and tracking devices. With our step challenges each week, team members from interns up to partners stay connected. The app has encouraged us to get up from our desks and get moving.” “One benefit of being on Johnson &amp; Johnson’s campus is their goal to be the healthiest company in the world,” Gerry said. “It dovetails nicely with everything we’re trying to do through Be well, work well. It’s a natural fit and has been beneficial for us. Plus, it’s so easy to earn points, not only for physical activities, but financial and others too.” How has the app helped the team? “We definitely have more of a team dialogue now,” Christina said. “And even with the competitiveness, it’s had a positive impact on us. We talk more about things outside of work, helping us build our relationships further.” Gerry agrees. “The Virgin Pulse app has resonated with the team. It has solidified us. We talk about it daily as part of our well-being conversation. It’s a great way to get your team together on a common platform.” Haven’t joined the new Well-Being Rewards Program yet? It’s easy! Go to http://join.virginpulse.com/PwCWellBeingRewards_US to activate your account.

It was a proud and humbling moment to celebrate with these talented graduates who are now ready to make their mark on the world. As I told them, I’m incredibly excited for the Class of 2019. The opportunities to go out and make a difference have never been greater, and I see tackling inequality as the biggest opportunity for this generation to take on. My advice to them was to focus on three things: First, to be successful in whatever you take on, make it personal. You can’t fix an issue if you don’t feel it in your heart. Go out into the world, meet other people and listen to them. That will help you figure out where you can make a difference. Second, if you want to drive change, you need to be willing to be unpopular. Leaders like Rosa Parks, Abraham Lincoln and Gandhi helped to move our world toward equality, but they weren’t always popular while disrupting the status quo. Being a leader means questioning the world and pushing others to reexamine their own assumptions and move out of their comfort zone. Last, don’t go it alone. Building a community around you and asking for help when you need it will make you more successful. Hear Tim’s advice to graduates Read Tim’s full speech It was a great day and I feel very fortunate to represent our firm and all of you at events like this. Meeting many committed and values-driven people at Duke Fuqua -- as well as working with all of you -- gives me confidence that we can take on the tough issues and succeed.

It’s a significant undertaking but there are resources and people to help. One group leading the charge is the Tax Staff Advisory Council (SAC). We’re excited to announce our new members for F19/20 Tax Staff Advisory Council (SAC). This talented group of colleagues were nominated by their Market or Business Leader based on their leadership skills, collaboration and solution-oriented mindset. The members will serve a two-year term and will work on a topic-specific workstream in support of Your Tomorrow, Project 5 Million and other key strategic priorities and operational needs. “Communication will be key,” says Michael Neid, a senior associate in Tax. “I’m excited to be a part of local conversations, help Tax staff understand the bigger picture and work with my fellow national council members to make sure we reach our goals. Over the next few months the new council members will participate in conversations and meetings where they will outline their strategic areas of focus. These topics will include helping Tax to create the capacity it needs to be effective with its strategic priorities, staff engagement, focusing on the big picture, and any concerns that are shared within the local markets. Council members in their own words “I really appreciated the time the leadership took to help us understand the bigger picture behind the firm initiatives, leadership's openness to our feedback, and their candid responses to our questions and concerns. It was great to receive leadership's encouragement for the council to brainstorm and vocalize solutions the council believed to be important for future success of the staff, the clients and the firm overall.” - Nodira Ismoilova, Tax Manager and current SAC member “I am very excited about this continued opportunity in my two-year term to ‘carry the torch’ for my office, generating new ideas while bringing back valuable learnings from leadership to my market.” - Steven Pocoroba, Tax Director and current SAC member “Working side by side with a brilliant, dynamic and motivated group of like-minded individuals provided the opportunity to be on the forefront of change through our firm's initiatives. Also, knowing our US leadership team values our ideas and welcomes everyone’s feedback shows how passionate they are for continued growth within the firm and through our people,” - Marie Biondi, a senior associate and former SAC member Be a part of the conversation and get to know your market council member Remember, the Tax National SAC is here to help, but it’s important they hear from you. Did you know conversations are happening in your local markets? We encourage you to participate in these advisory council meetings.

In a recent meeting with the company’s executive leaders, Jenna Jones and Lauren Heim -- two senior associates -- spearheaded a technology demo that still has the client’s team talking about “what’s possible” with tech. This duo has worked with Ameren for approximately five years. In that time, they've been focusing on delivering a quality audit and actively talking with the client about the tools and technologies that we're implementing as part of the audit process. Turns out, they are interested in innovation and on a similar journey as well. Given the client’s interest in how we’re tech-enabling the audit, the team sprung to action and demonstrated some of the new tools and technologies we currently have at PwC, as well as some being developed for the future. According to the team, preparation took just one week, and left a lasting impression. During the demo, Ameren’s senior leaders were actively engaged and asking questions -- and the interactive dialogue has only continued from there. Now, this team is helping other teams in their office provide technology demonstrations to their clients. Beneficial for the client and our team "Presenting our technology gave our associates, senior associates and managers more exposure to upper level management, including the CFO, CAO, and CIO. The client really liked that we — the actual team members who work with their data every day — were showcasing the technology and what it could do.” - Lauren Heim “The experience also gave us all the opportunity to develop our digital acumen, build our digital IQ, and become a "team expert" on select technology. I’d encourage other teams to consider doing a similar tech demo for their own clients -- it gave us an important opportunity to show, not tell, how we’re tech-enabling the audit and how we’re well on our way to becoming a digitally enabled firm.” - Jenna Jones (Pictured: Ameren team) Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/28706.html</url><pwc_title>How one PwC team helped 11 Make-A-Wish kids take flight</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:18:47</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>news-type:Firmwide|source:Advisory</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-05-07 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:Advisory</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>How one PwC team helped 11 Make-A-Wish kids take flight How one PwC team helped 11 Make-A-Wish kids take flight Advisory May 7, 2018 When IPS Associate Chris Kohlenberger recently saw a Make-A-Wish advertisement as he was rushing through the Newark airport to catch a flight, he had no idea that he, along with the IPS Academy, staff and Partners, would be instrumental in sending at least 11 Make-A-Wish kids on their dream trips. “I noticed that the ad said ‘Over 70% of Make-A-Wish kids need airline miles to travel to their dream destinations,’ so I decided to connect frequent fliers with an abundance of points (US consultants) to the kids that really need them,” Chris said. Across the US, the Make-A-Wish® Foundation serves others by granting wishes to children with life-threatening conditions. This year, more than 75% of Wish kids will travel for their once-in-a-lifetime experience. As a result, Make-A-Wish needs 2.9 billion airline miles to fly Wish kids and their families to their destination of choice. Many major airlines enable frequent flier members to donate to Make-A-Wish. “Donating miles is a simple but meaningful way you can play a part in helping grant these wishes,” said Chris. So how’d he and the IPS Academy pull it off? It was simple.The IPS Academy Responsible Business Leadership (RBL) Lead, Roberto Gonzalez, fully supported the campaign and reached out to PwC’s national RBL team for additional guidance. Branden Elkins and Kelly O'Shea, the IPS Academy Leads, were equally as encouraging and put Chris in touch with the Academy Sponsors and Communications Team. Collectively, the group helped bring the campaign together. Through various communications, the Academy directed people to donate miles through a special site that Make-A-Wish created, and the team also accommodated for people to donate monetarily through PwC’s own Impact Space portal. The campaign ran officially from from April 1-29 -- which was World Wish Day, the anniversary of the first wish ever granted. IPS collected more than 550,000 miles, which should send about 11 children on the trip of a lifetime! While the official campaign is over, we can still collect miles and donations to contribute to Make-A-Wish! If you’re interested in donating your own miles, please visit the IPS Make-A-Wish Miles Donation portal.

As I look through this list of 92 leaders, it’s bittersweet for me. I’m so grateful for all their contributions and happy for them as they begin this exciting new phase. But, I will miss them. They have been friends and people I am proud to call my partners. I know that the people on this list have been important to you as well, either individually — as a mentor, advisor, or simply a friendly face in the hallway — or collectively, as builders of a firm where you have developed professionally and had exciting opportunities. As they prepare to enjoy this next phase of life, let’s send our retiring partners off with our deepest thanks, and spend time to learn from them so we can sustain and build on all they’ve accomplished.

To help our clients prepare for these changes, our One Firm campaign shows how 4IR can help organizations rise above uncertainty. We’re well-positioned to help clients transform their business through strategy, growth, trusted technology adoption and workforce development. We’re planning to continue promoting the campaign into FY20 and recently featured it at our Spring Exchange. Continue the discussion with your clients — as appropriate — by getting familiar with key resources in the Platforms Navigator (under Firmwide Campaigns), including a new conversation starter and our continually updated 4IR page on pwc.com (pwc.com/4iready). And check out this new video we’re now featuring online, which shows why PwC is the partner to help organizations get ready for the transformation ahead. A reminder There are important — and different — benefits for bringing our 4IR capabilities to our audit and non-audit clients. For audit clients, the focus will be on education and driving awareness of this seismic shift in how we live and work (and even play). It also ushers in a revolution of experience. And in the non-audit context, 4IR will help us empower leading organizations to intelligently apply technology to solve important business challenges. It’ll drive innovation and new business opportunities, while decreasing costs and increasing productivity to rise above current market volatility and a predicted economic downturn. Questions?

On your phone, you quickly forward a confidential doc to your PwC colleague Paola for her input. Oh no. You just sent the document to Paula, not Paola. Now, an external party has your client’s confidential information, and you need to contact Ethics &amp; Compliance right away. To avoid this kind of incident, make it a habit it do three quick checks before hitting Send: Check your account: Make sure you’re using a PwC email account, not your personal account. Check your recipients: Double-check the recipient names and email addresses. Check your attachments: Make sure you attach the correct file, and encrypt it if you’re sending highly confidential information outside the firm. Don’t forget to enable the Undo Send feature in Google Mail. It’s only a matter of time until you wish you had. Save yourself the oops moment and turn it on — like, right now. Keep work devices to yourself You may be tempted to let your family or friends use your laptop or mobile device. Don’t! Your devices provide access to PwC and/or client information.

The IRS opened the preparer tax identification number (PTIN) system for 2019 renewals Monday, October 22nd. It is our understanding the IRS sent out renewal notices to all PTIN holders indicating that the 2019 PTIN renewal period is now underway. All tax professionals should have also received notification from the firm of a My Compliance Dashboard entry regarding their 2019 PTIN requirement on October 23, 2018. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN and updating your status in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database, you will be required to complete your My Compliance Dashboard PTIN requirement by the due date. As a reminder, the PTIN requirement is a three-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or approved exemption) in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database Complete your PTIN Confirmation requirement on your Compliance Dashboard The PTIN Requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2018 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2018 PTIN before you can renew for 2019. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2018 calendar year. The firm requires all personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must create an entry in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit. NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update your status in the database accordingly. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202)346-5219 or Mike McDermott at (949)437-5413.

These groups will receive separate communications regarding your Annual Enrollment elections. We all work hard and we need to take care of ourselves. That’s why we’ve made well-being a central part of Be well, work well and our Your Tomorrow commitment. We have many resources in place to help us play an active role in our personal well-being -- not only physically, but mentally, spiritually and emotionally. We’ve captured a snapshot of our many programs below*. * Eligibility varies for the programs listed in the chart. Today, we want to update you on Annual Enrollment, which is the time each year that we make choices about the PwC benefit plans that support our well-being throughout the year. PwC's Annual Enrollment starts on Wednesday, May 1, and ends on Wednesday, May 15, for benefits effective July 1, 2019. During Annual Enrollment, we encourage you to consider your medical plan options, and the benefits of participating in the vision, dental and legal plans and flexible spending accounts. One of the benefits of investing in Be well, work well and all of our well-being programs is that they help address an issue that’s important to our business and to society in general – rising healthcare costs. In our nation, medical costs have been rising at 3x the general inflation rate – PwC is not immune but we've elected this year to keep medical plan premium increases well below the national average. Last year there was no premium increase for medical plan coverage. This year, we have taken many steps to manage premiums so that they will only increase between $1 and $10 per pay period depending on your medical plan option. Annual deductibles in the High and Middle Deductible Plans will go up by $25-$100 for the plan year based on your plan/coverage level. In addition, costs for our dental, vision and legal plans will not change, and dental coverage will increase by $500 per plan year. We’re also enhancing the medical plan. Limits for outpatient physical, speech, occupational and cognitive rehabilitation therapy services, are moving from a 90 visit limit combined to 90 visits for each therapy type per plan year. If you don't want to make any changes to your benefits, you do not need to do anything; your current elections will carry over starting July 1, 2019, except for Flexible Spending Accounts – or FSAs. You must enroll/re-enroll in the Dental &amp; Vision FSA and/or the Dependent Care FSA if you want to participate starting July 1, 2019. Please see below for more on the upcoming annual enrollment. Learn more Review the FY20 Staff Annual Enrollment Flyer for details about what’s changing as well as the new plan costs for FY20. Please let the file completely download before navigating through the document. Visit PwC’s Annual Enrollment website at mybenefits.pwc.com. This is your gateway to all the information you need to make your decisions and elections. The website is viewable from any PC or IOS device with your PwC GUID and password. Here are some helpful links: Annual Enrollment flyer provides all the details about the changes and actions you need to take during Annual Enrollment. Medical plan summary comparison provides a side-by-side comparison of the three medical plans. Access instructions for prior claims information so you can estimate how much you can expect in claims in the coming plan year. Claims examples illustrate the total costs of each plan based on the amount of claims and coverage level.

If you participate in a PwC medical plan option and haven’t already elected to contribute to your HSA, or you want to contribute more, make your contribution elections during Annual Enrollment. (Note: You can change your election at any time throughout the year.) For information about how HSAs can benefit you, view the short video, How to Use Your HSA and participate in the webcast on May 2. (Note that the webcast will be recorded and available for replay.) Digital PT with Hinge Health. Another investment the firm recently made in our well-being is the addition of Hinge Health. Hinge Health offers an innovative, at-home digital physical therapy program using a tablet and wearable sensors to those suffering from knee and back pain and is available to our partners, staff and their family members (age 18+) who are enrolled in a PwC UnitedHealthcare (UHC) medical plan and meet the participation criteria established by Hinge Health. Review the PwC Inside article announcing this new benefit for more details. Reminder: Well-Being Rewards and LiveWell Resources. This past July, we introduced a digitally-enabled Well-Being Rewards Program, along with LiveWell Resources that offers six free mental health visits. These programs continue to provide important resources and tools to support your well-being, and you do not need to be enrolled in a PwC medical plan to take advantage of these benefits. Make your benefit elections May 1-15 for coverage effective July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 If you’re enrolled in the High, Middle or Low Deductible Plan and don’t make an election during Annual Enrollment, your current medical plan elections will carry over on July 1, 2019. If enrolling in the High, Middle or Low High Deductible Plan for the first time, an HSA will be opened automatically for you if you don't already have one. It’s important to make contributions to the HSA to help pay for medical expenses such as deductibles and coinsurance. (You will need to complete the verification process in order for your account to be fully functional. If you previously closed a HealthEquity HSA, you will need to contact HealthEquity to reopen an account.) If you are currently enrolled in the dental, vision and/or legal plan, your current coverage will continue on July 1, 2019, unless you make a change during Annual Enrollment. Flexible Spending Account elections will not automatically carry over—you must enroll/re-enroll at Benefits Express between May 1 and May 15. Make elections at Benefits Express via mybenefits.pwc.com.

So, for example, instead of having to log into separate systems, Rapid Engage will start drafts of EAFs, Authorization for Services forms (if needed), myEngage code requests and more for you, and then provide you with the links to finish them up! Bookmark Rapid Engage and use it -- it’ll help make 2019 better. There’s a new, combined EAF in town. We’re making your life easier by combining three legacy consulting Engagement Acceptance Forms (EAFs) into one Consulting Services Engagement Assessment form. The legacy forms for Advisory Services, Assurance-led Consulting Services and Litigation &amp; Dispute Services are a thing of the past -- eliminating the guesswork and, if/when needed, routing you straight to the appropriate Risk Management Partner for the service you’re providing. (You may remember, we’ve organized our specialist areas in OFRO by service offering, instead of by line of service or business unit.) Speaking of Rapid Engage … did you know it’s going live in Mexico? That’s right! Starting Monday, January 14, our Mexico teams have access to Rapid Engage, too. Spread the word and encourage your colleagues to use it. Have questions? Check out the OFRO portal and explore Rapid Engage today.

Read on below for more information on these two important changes: Regarding the topic of independence assessments, USIP now reflects the required use of the My Independence Assessment tool to facilitate all independence assessments. As discussed in Friday’s Assurance line of service PwC Inside article, use of the My Independence Assessment tool, which automates the independence assessment process for engagement teams, is now required. Previously, teams had the option to use the self-guided instructions in the Independence Assessment Toolkit — instead of the new tool — for US-only assessments. Now, all assessments must be conducted through the My Independence Assessment tool. Regarding affiliates, USIP now clarifies the application of the firm’s policies regarding the definition of affiliates of SEC audit clients. Specifically, it explains an entity that is controlled by a significant influence/material investee (SIM) affiliate of an SEC audit client is also an affiliate of the audit client, regardless of whether the controlled entity is material to the audit client. Please note: these policy changes go into effect on Tuesday, April 16, 2019.

Sadly, we were also reminded once again that bigotry and intolerance of the beliefs of others can have tragic consequences. The bombings that took place in churches and hotels in Sri Lanka resulted in hundreds of lives lost. I’m sad for those killed as well as those who are feeling this personally because of their ties to Sri Lanka, or their shared faith. The ability to be ourselves -- and follow our beliefs freely -- is essential to who we are and an important element of the diversity we celebrate within our firm You’ve heard me say it before -- but as we continue to see hatred and violence, we need to talk about these issues and continue to do our part to create a safe and respectful environment for each of us.

If you’ve been on LinkedIn or other social media apps lately, you may have also noticed that quite a few of your PwC connections are already getting theirs. Feeling a bit behind? Don’t worry! We’ve answered your top questions on Digital Quests below, including how to get started so you can show off your shiny new Digital Acumen knowledge badge in no time: What are Digital Quests? Digital Quests are real-life consumer and business scenarios and problems that require you to use your digital skills to find the solutions. You'll see work samples, listen to client needs and take on the perspective of different characters as you tackle each assessment and put your digital skills to work. Completing the four Digital Quests will earn you the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. You can access them on the Digital Quest page of the Digital Hub on your PC or mobile device. What are digital badges / the Digital Acumen knowledge badge? Digital badges are a new way at PwC to showcase the skills and knowledge that we’re gaining to succeed in today’s changing world and help our clients tackle their biggest challenges. They are visible, portable symbols of our journey as infinite learners, reflecting our achievements, ambitions and experience. They are designed — and encouraged — to be shared on TalentLink, social media and through email — so you can market your learning accomplishments in and outside the firm. The Digital Acumen knowledge badge is earned by completing the four Digital Quests. This badge represents an understanding of the core digital skills that are the foundation for Digital Upskilling, and your ability to leverage that knowledge when scoping engagements and leading conversations internally and with clients. If I’ve attempted a Digital Academy or other technical training, can I earn my Digital Acumen knowledge badge without completing the four Digital Quests? No. You must complete all four Digital Quests to earn a Digital Acumen knowledge badge. Why should I complete the Digital Quests? By completing all four Digital Quests, you’ll meet our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal of earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. Our goal is for everyone to earn their Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30. Learn2earn provides an extra incentive to reach our goal early — if eligible staff complete their Digital Quests and earn a minimum of 150 Digital Lab points before April 30, they’ll be entered to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — one in seven will win! What is the deadline for earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge? The goal is for all staff and partners to earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30. How do I get started? Head to the Digital Hub available on PC or mobile device by downloading the Digital Hub app from PwC’s App Store! You’ll find all the tools and resources you need to prepare for and conquer the Digital Quests. What happens after I complete all four Digital Quests? After completing the four Digital Quests (they can be completed in any order), you’ll receive an email outlining next steps. You can expect to receive your badge via email within six business days (the timing of issuing badges will be adjusted for firm holidays). Once you receive your badge, be sure to share it on TalentLink, LinkedIn and social media, keeping in mind these social media do’s and don’ts. See this quick start guide for information on how to share your badge.

Little did she know that her move would lead to a defining moment for her career and for the firm. When Hurricane Irma hit Florida’s West Coast, Wendy was the only member of the US-based Americas IT customer support Help Desk team who wasn’t living in the area -- so it was up to her to solve the problems that arose as a result of the storm. Here’s more from Wendy: Tell us a little bit about your current role at PwC. I’m a member of the Americas IT organization, which supports our IT infrastructure and firm applications across the US, Canada, Brazil, the Caribbean and some of Latin America. I’m on the IT Customer Support team, which means I’m on the front line of helping our people address their IT issues. I’ve been with the help desk for nine years. What was Hurricane Irma like for you? In the lead up to the storm, the path of the hurricane started moving west, and we realized it had the potential to impact the Tampa ESC, where my entire US team is based, along with the IT headquarters. Everyone was understandably preparing for the storm, and I was in North Carolina. I told them, “Go take care of your families and your homes, and I’ll take care of the help desk.” On Saturday, PwC Security called the help desk with a problem: They didn’t have the capacity to handle the number of calls they anticipated from staff and partners seeking help. I worked all day Saturday, Saturday night and into Sunday in collaboration with our offshore team to come up with a solution that would allow calls to be routed to more than one person at a time. On Sunday morning, I trained Lisette Martinez, a member of our PwC Security team, on the new solution, just as the storm was beginning to hit Florida in full force. But there was more to come -- on Sunday night the power went out in the Tampa ESC, disrupting call routing for various call centers. I woke up Monday morning to find that the emergency hotline calls were not going to route as planned at the scheduled time. After I notified the appropriate leaders about the issue, the IT Help Desk was asked to take the calls for the Emergency Hotline. I immediately began training our offshore center, who had never taken emergency hotline calls. We got the calls rerouted there so that we could continue to offer critical support to our people, who were calling in with requests for everything from back-up generators to temporary housing, in the middle of one of the worst natural disasters any of them had ever experienced. During the storm, I took on a broader role -- supporting PwC Security in whatever they needed. It became a “Do whatever you have to do” situation. We ended up fielding about 200 calls to the hotline related to Hurricane Irma, and every single one of them was able to get through, despite the problems we were dealing with behind the scenes. Looking back at the experience, how did you demonstrate our purpose in your response? A lot of it was about trust -- people trust that the firm will be there for them in times of incredible need. It’s one of the things that makes us special. People can’t call the emergency hotline during a hurricane and get a busy signal or a “Sorry, your call can’t be answered at this time.” It just can’t happen. So we had to think outside the box, and do things we hadn’t done before, and that definitely made me feel like I was solving an important problem. How did this experience help you find meaning in your work? Working on the help desk, I don’t always get to see the immediate impact of what I do every day, because so much happens behind the scenes. We work hard every day to meet the expectations of the firm, but if we are doing our job well, things are running smoothly and it may not even be noticed. With a situation like this, I could see the direct and immediate impact of what I was working on, and it was really energizing to see how my experience and skills helped me create quick workarounds in this high-pressure situation. I had a purpose, and that purpose was to ensure there was no downtime, no impact and no bad experience for anyone being affected by Irma. The commitment the firm has made that the emergency hotline would be there for partners and staff, no matter what -- delivering on that was my purpose. It doesn’t take a natural disaster to be a hero. Whether we’re conducting a forensics investigation, implementing a new technology or helping clients navigate a merger, people place their trust in us when the stakes are high. No matter what our role, we all have opportunities to go above and beyond to deliver our work and find meaning in what we do every day. How does our purpose resonate with you?

Attend your LoS/IFS year-end training session or replay (see Google site) Leverage resources on the RL Year-End Playbook Google site. *LoS reminders: Advisory: Snapshots for Advisory staff should include contributions to Digital Upskilling and to the development and adoption of our Integrated Solutions. Here is additional guidance on how to capture these important activities. Assurance: Assurance staff who do not have 80% of total hours worked covered in Snapshots by 4/30 must follow the FY19 &lt;80% Hours Guidance.

These are the exact situations Layna Dugan and Vladimir Anichkin found themselves in recently. “My son had a bad ear infection and wasn’t able to go to daycare, but I had a looming deadline for a big deliverable that I couldn’t move,” said Layna Dugan, a senior manager with our Internal Communications &amp; Change team. “I called a babysitter and had her come to my house so I could be close to my son if he needed anything, but also allowed me to get my work done. I was easily reimbursed for the money I paid out of pocket.” Last-minute support Vladimir Anichkin found himself in a similar situation and was also able to use the back-up benefit. “My wife is our primary caregiver, watching our kids full-time,” said Vlad, a manager in the Hallandale Experience Center. “But on the week a partner asked me to travel unexpectedly, I was supposed to watch our kids because she had prior commitments that were going to keep her from being able to watch them.” Knowing that PwC’s Dependent Reimbursement Program will pay up to $1,000 per fiscal year for back-up childcare, Vlad quickly called his mom, who lives out of state, and asked her to fly down to Florida. She was on the next flight. The program provides monetary reimbursement when an employee’s normal caregiver is not available. Vlad simply paid his mom a per diem for her time, and by filling out a quick form, he saw the funds in his paycheck the following month. “I didn’t think I’d ever have to use this benefit, but it ended up being a lifesaver in a last-minute pinch. My wife could keep her commitment and I got to pitch my dream client,” he smiled. Learn more about PwC benefits that give you the flexibility to be your best at home and at work.

In Austin for SXSW, the bus experience was covered by multiple local news outlets, including KXAN (click here for the full video). The set-up at SXSW included a chalk wall, where people could write why they act on diversity and inclusion, and every single spot was filled with responses demonstrating how passionate people are about this issue. The Check Your Blind Spots tour has been sparking dialogue with fellow signatory organizations around issues of shared importance. Once the USAA tour stop was finalized, the USAA account team proactively worked to create an experience that would not only educate team members on unconscious bias, but strengthen their relationship with a key client. In addition, the week before the event, the USAA client came to New York for an in-depth conversation around our digital upskilling journey and work in diversity and inclusion. Over 200 USAA employees and 50+ PwC team members went through the bus! It was a fantastic and eye opening experience for everyone, and we've continued to make the content a part of our team meetings since the event. It’s clear that diversity and inclusion is important to us and to our clients. In less than two years, more than 600 CEOs have signed the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™ pledge, and the coalition continues to showcase the power of collective action. As you discuss this topic with your clients, make sure you’re well-versed in the resources and services we offer through the Workforce of the Future platform and our Office of Diversity. Why do you act on diversity &amp; inclusion? Take the I Act On pledge today, talk about your commitment and ask your teams and clients to do the same. Don’t forget to follow the Check Your Blind Spots tour schedule here to experience it when it’s in your neck of the woods, and follow the tour on Twitter (@CEOAction) and Instagram(@CEO_Action)!

Be well, work well and Digital Fitness Night of the living ... Be well, work well and Digital Fitness People Team June 25, 2018 Pop culture has captivated audiences with imagery of zombies rising from the dead to take over the world. But if there WERE a zombie apocalypse, would you be prepared? Our Bay Area Google account team doubts it will happen, but they’re training anyway. Embracing our Your Tomorrow strategy, the team took on two challenges -- increase wellness activities and build their Digital Fitness. And they’re having a blast doing it! Be well, work well One Friday every month, the team travels to a local gym for an intense hour-long Zombie Apocalypse Survival Training class, focused on core and group exercises. Partner Emmet Daly introduced the unique class to his team. “I wanted to engage them in a fun activity that promotes wellness,” Emmet said. “To survive a hypothetical zombie apocalypse, an individual needs to tap into all four dimensions of their energy: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. In the Zombie Apocalypse Survival Training class, similar to many Crossfit classes, participants use different types of equipment -- sandbags, kettlebells, slam balls -- that challenge their core strength and coordination. We motivate each other to get through the session. It’s a true team experience!” Emmet initially thought the training session would be a one-time event. However, the team enjoyed it so much, it’s now a monthly ritual. Manager Kalil Samra looks forward to the workouts and sees a positive difference in team morale. “It’s great to come together and tap into the four dimensions of energy outside the office. Sometimes it’s difficult to get to the gym after work due to our hectic schedules. Zombie Apocalypse Survival Training is a fun way to take time off from work to exercise with your teammates. We bond, have fun and emerge a little fitter each time,” he said. Digital Fitness Recognizing that technology would also be another major advantage we have over zombies, Emmet also posed a second Your Tomorrow challenge to his team, this time through Digital Fitness. “Everyone, from partner to associate, is tasked with developing two bots in six months. The bots will be used on our client engagement. We’ve rolled out the training and technology needed for everyone to accomplish this goal and look forward to impressing the client.” Senior Associate Vidhi Dave was the first teammate to pilot Robotics Process Automation (RPA) in testing Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley 302 certification requirements. With little background in RPA, Vidhi successfully built her first robot in just two days. Vidhi simply watched tutorials available on Vantage, YouTube and UiPath, and met with Kallil, her manager, to facilitate the elearning. “It’s nice to see the firm encourage innovation that not only adds value to the engagement but also to your skill set,” Vidhi says. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to self learn and raise my digital IQ in the regular course of our engagement.” Follow the team on Instagram to see how they keep up with well-being and Digital Fitness. More importantly, keep up with your own wellness and Digital Fitness progress -- download our new tool to help on your journey.

New devices and digital banking tools give consumers the convenience of banking on the go, but the traditional banking center still has plenty of fans for certain kinds of transactions. In PwC’s 2018 Digital Banking Consumer Survey, we look beyond this split to see how firms can serve the needs of today’s consumers.

Adam Pannone in spin class — every sport led to his team’s “hiking” goals! Update: Since this article was first published last year, Adam attended a Digital Academy and is now a Digital Academy instructor, and a Digital Accelerator. As an Army reservist, he stays committed to his service as an instructor at the US Army's Command and General Staff College, where he received the US Army Reserve's 2018 Instructor of the Year award. He was also promoted to Lieutenant Colonel last summer. Adam stays connected to his team as they continue to integrate their Be well, work well goals by making movement a priority. They also never miss an opportunity to show appreciation to those around them. Team "Ocean’s Ten" wanted to do something physical for the Be well, work well habit challenge and they wanted their goal to involve travel. So, where did they go? "To the top of the Himalayas, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Mount Ararat and Mount Everest," said L&amp;D Senior Manager Adam Pannone. Not literally, of course. To “reach” these landmarks, they used spatial data tools to simulate what it would feel like to actually be there. "For example,” Adam explained, “along our journey we pulled pictures from the internet to see what the trek and peaks looked like. We also encouraged each other to use our imaginations as much as possible.” Competition among them was nonexistent. "Everything counted, some contributed more ‘miles’ than others by whatever activity they chose, but we all pulled together. There were no single goals — it was us against the mountains," he said. The team decided to track miles collectively, no matter the activity or tracking tool, to reach a new and exciting '’destination" each week. Along the journey, Ocean’s Ten expanded their global acumen by immersing themselves in the culture of their simulated surroundings, sharing their knowledge through team emails and videos. "We learned firsthand the team that climbs together, stays together,” said Adam. “There's strength in numbers; this challenge brought us closer." You can do it! Whether racking up miles with walking meetings, running, cycling, pilates or other activities, when they met each milestone, they celebrated and continued their climb until they reached the next goal. "We cheered each other on by saying 'you can do it, only a few more miles to get to the next mountain top,'" said Adam. They coupled their efforts with better food choices — and a healthy dose of gratitude. How did they do, overall? "We surpassed our goal by logging a total of 1,719 miles over the three-month period, which was way more than expected," he said. When they climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro, Adam felt compelled to write his wife a letter reflecting the sense of awe, gratitude and wonderment he was feeling. "It began as a physical challenge, but morphed into so much more," he said. They reached their final destination, the summit of Mount Everest, the last week in April. For Ocean's Ten, the Habit challenge also surpassed the physical. "It fueled our emotional energy," said Adam. "I can't think of a better firm initiative; it allowed us to address the whole person." Why the team title? "There are 10 of us. We're missing George Clooney, but otherwise we're a cohesive team that bonded along our journey toward wellness," he said.

Here's what you need to do You must complete a "notification" AFS for C2 GPA clients in the same manner as you would for a restricted entity. This means the "notification" AFS must be completed, and submitted to the Global Relationship Partner ("GRP") listed in CES before you execute the engagement contract and before you begin work ("engaging" with the client). A "notification" AFS is required for all related entities of C2 GPA clients. You will need to search for your client in CES. If your client is not designated as restricted or as a C2 GPA client in CES, you must also be sure to check the GPA list included on the Global Client Portal. Note: You should also check the status of the client’s domestic and global ultimate parent. If the parent is a C2 GPA, you will need to prepare a "notification" AFS for any work performed for it and its subsidiaries and related entities. Although C2 GPA clients are not audit clients, a "notification" AFS is still a control for the Firm so that the GRP listed in CES for C2 GPA clients and related entities is notified of new services (accordingly, the AFS does not need an "approval confirmation" from the GRP listed in CES). Identifying and submitting the appropriate notifications for C2 GPA clients and their related entities requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. Additional information is available in the Channel 2 Guide: Preparing a Channel 2 AFS Request found under the AFS Help - Policy Guidance section in the AFS system. For further information contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

Growing up, I was blessed to have a strong support network that helped me achieve my goals. Unfortunately, many high school students are not fortunate enough to have mentors to guide them through their most vulnerable years. When I saw that there was an opportunity through Skills for Society to put my professional skills to work to help an organization called iMentor more effectively support first-generation students from low-income communities working hard to graduate high school, succeed in college and achieve their ambitions, I knew I had to be part of it. While iMentor has a strong mentor network (which includes many PwCers, since it is part of our Access Your Potential initiative), to scale their impact and the organization’s footprint, they need to evolve the experience in order to recruit additional high-quality mentors. A One Firm team of nine PwCers in Chicago, myself included, came together to help iMentor think through their strategy. We analyzed their data to understand correlations, find trends and provide strategic recommendations to improve the mentor experience. Collaborating and upskilling While I expected to be challenged and learn a lot from this project, an unexpected benefit was building new relationships with colleagues I wouldn’t have normally crossed paths with. We each brought something different to the table. I provided my project management skills, while others shared Tableau skills — which I was thrilled to learn from them! One teammate even went as far as to guide me through the deliverable creation process after finding out I didn’t have much experience delivering data-driven findings in PowerPoint. It’s only been a few weeks since we concluded the project and iMentor is already using the Tableau dashboards our team helped create to improve their data tracking quality. We also provided them with strategic recommendations to enhance the mentor experience, including strengthening the peer mentor network and providing mentors with resources to better assist their mentees with the college admissions process. Being part of this project gave me a chance to challenge myself in new ways and it was incredibly rewarding to know that the recommendations we gave the organization would help students change the course of their lives. One of our main contacts at the organization summed up our impact by stating: “Thanks so much for ALL you did on this project. We are grateful and will be using the recommendations, insights and data as we map Mentor Experience priorities and strategies in 2019 and beyond!” How can you get involved? It’s easy.

As we kickoff the second half of FY19, I first want to reiterate how incredibly impressed I am with our team and the impact we’re making with our clients. If you saw my video message, $2.7B and counting, you know that this achievement is a record high for us and our strategy is truly setting us apart from the competition. Heading into the last two quarters of the fiscal year, let’s move forward with these things in mind: ● Commit to digital upskilling: Our investment in digital is helping us address the needs of clients, but more importantly, it’s providing you with a unique development opportunity to gain skills for the future. As you’ll see below, one of our biggest priorities this quarter is to get everyone trained to contribute to and use automations from Digital Lab. If you have not yet attended Digital Academy, please sign up via the link in the Your Tomorrow section. ● Bring your ideas to the table: The power of digital upskilling comes when we see it action, just as we saw with one of our teams at NBCUniversal. I know you have innovative solutions to bring to our engagements, and I want to see them! Drop them into Digital Lab, or share a story with our staff council about how you’re bringing your digital skills to your teams. ● Put our tools to work: Remember to use our operational tools like Salesforce and FlexForecast to help manage your engagements and collaborate across teams. Before you read the updates below, I’d also like to give a shoutout to our January promotees -- Congratulations and wishing you the best in your roles! Thank you for your hard work, team! Delivering as One Firm: Risk &amp; Regulatory Platform in Action Our Forensics team across the US and Mexico provided solutions to a company that is engaged in the operation and development of power generation facilities. The team was tasked with evaluating the policies and procedures, as well as the accounting controls, which the client had in its subsidiaries across several countries. Through this evaluation, the client was better able to make decisions regarding process improvement for their compliance program. A key differentiator in this win was the combination of capabilities brought by the Forensics team in Mexico and New York. Shoutout to the team -- Manny Alas, Bill MacMillan, Mónica Ribas, Raymundo Lira, Alfredo Hernandez and Margarita Cansino! Leadership: Check out the latest GEP, APP and Advisory Leadership updates. ● Q2 Results: Q2 FYTD, total Advisory ACM was favorable to budget by $37.7M (3.3%), revenue of $2.7B is $32.6M favorable to budget, engagement margin of 28.0% is 1.5 points above budget and 3.3 points improved over prior year, and client utilization is below budget by 0.4 points at 67.2%. ● Investing in our business: ○ The investments we’ve made in our Integrated Solutions are making a difference with our clients and the value we’re able to deliver. Check out how our Strategy/Enterprise Resilience Integrated Solution coupled with our BXT approach is helping Health Care Services Corporation (HCSC) improve the health care experience for ~1.5M people this year and 14M+ people by 2021, with over $600M projected total cost savings. ○ Want to deliver the same impact on your engagements? Take Integrated Solutions training so you can bring these offerings to the table. There’s an Integrated Solutions Overview course and training for your specific Go-to-Market (GTM) team. ● You saw the news! We can all start making plans as Tim Ryan announced earlier this week that we’ll have the week of July 4th off. As with last year, we have a few activities to complete on our Your Tomorrow journey before that shutdown. Here’s what we need to do: ○ Complete all four Digital Quests by April 30 (Note: Our goal as a firm is still to complete these quests and earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30 ... but we’re adding an incentive to beat the last-minute dash to the end!) ○ Earn 150 points by April 30 as an active member of the Digital Lab community, by contributing to and/or using the resources of Digital Lab. Everyone who successfully completes the challenge will be entered into a raffle for up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win (you can read the contest rules here). ● In addition, if you haven’t already, be sure to sign up for the Digital Academy. Our goal in Advisory is to have everyone attend a session before the end of the quarter (3/31). Keep a lookout for new sessions, and remember that if you’re unable to attend in your home market due to business travel, you’re able to sign up for a session in a different location. ● Considering an MBA program as the next step in your career? The Advisory Scholars Program is accepting applications now for academic sponsorships starting in Summer/Fall 2019 or Winter/Spring 2020. Application deadline is February 1! ● Don’t forget to use your Real-time recognition balance by January 16 or lose it. Real-time recognition budgets are loaded twice per year to promote more frequent recognition; half of your annual budget is in the system now. The second half will be loaded on January 17. (Note: You will see your spending balance during the recognition process on your PC.)

In the era of Trump, how resilient are US markets? Office of Government Sept. 13, 2018 by Roslyn Brooks (For internal use only) We’re currently riding the longest-running bull market in history. But the continued political discord in Washington and the upcoming midterm elections could threaten the market’s rise, and ultimately break this trend. Will the good economic times last? Can they? Will the positive Trump-US markets trend continue? Since President Trump’s inauguration one year and seven months ago, the benefits of the administration’s pro-business, deregulatory efforts appear to have outweighed the risks associated with uncertainty caused by some of the president's actions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached an all-time high in June, while the S&amp;P 500 surpassed its previous all-time high set in January. Powered by a rebound in consumer spending and business investment in the wake of tax reform, unemployment is at historic lows, corporate earnings are high, and GDP grew at 4.1% -- the strongest pace in nearly four years -- during the second quarter this year. This happened as President Trump pulled out of -- or threatened to pull out of -- multiple international agreements, alliances, and trade deals and proposed tariffs on goods imported to the US by traditional US allies. These actions, coupled with continued inquiries and investigations into various aspects of the Trump campaign and administration, eventually could provide enough uncertainty to unsettle global markets. As of yet, the US economy has remained mostly unaffected. Stocks continue to rise, breaking one record after another. The president’s trade negotiation tactics, however unorthodox, have so far produced positive results. The threat of US tariffs on goods from traditional and non-traditional US allies has brought many countries to the negotiating table to reexamine decade-old trade policies. For example, after a year of negotiations to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Trump administration recently informed Congress that it will sign a new agreement with Mexico in late November, while negotiations to include Canada in a three-way pact continue. Furthermore, talks between the US and European Union (EU) regarding lowering transatlantic commercial trade barriers are underway. The negotiations stem from a July agreement which suspended the president’s threat to raise US duties on EU automobiles and worked to resolve their dispute over steel and aluminium tariffs, while working to achieve a bilateral trade deal. While US markets largely have maintained status quo in response to these global entanglements, economists warn the US economy could begin to slow if the US engages in an all-out trade war with China. Trade tensions and tit-for-tat diplomacy between the US and China have recently increased. In early July, the US began implementing duties of 25% on $34 billion in Chinese goods, prompting a swift reaction from China, which introduced an equivalent 25% tariff on $34 billion in American goods. The US Trade Representative recently implemented 25% tariffs on its list of Chinese imports worth $16 billion. To no surprise, China is expected to announce its own 25% tariffs on $16 billion of US goods in retaliation. President Trump has said there is “no time frame” for ending the dispute with China and has urged Americans to be “patient,” but some question whether patience could run dry if tariffs significantly affect farmers, steelworkers, and automakers -- many who represent the president’s base of supporters. If the president’s actions on trade negatively impact the economy, which has historically been a deciding factor for many voters, it could create additional challenges for Republicans in the November midterm elections. Congress With midterm elections less than two months away, the remainder of the congressional agenda is likely to be driven by must-pass legislative items and politics. House lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill last week, and Congress only has 28 joint legislative days scheduled before the end of the year (and they may leave early to campaign). On the policy front, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization, the Water Resources Development Act, and government funding for fiscal year 2019 will garner immediate attention. Government funding is set to lapse after Sept. 30. Both chambers have been working to pass appropriations measures, but President Trump has threatened to shut down the government if Congress refuses to vote to fund a wall on the southern border. The full Senate is expected to hold a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court before the Court begins its new term Oct. 1. Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing began last week, and with the slim 51-49 majority held by Senate Republicans, there is little room for error. Barring an unforeseen development, it is likely Judge Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Court. 2018 midterm elections Democrats need 23 seats to take the House majority and some political pundits have hinted at a “Blue Wave” of dramatic gains. However, change is coming to Washington whether there is a blue wave or no wave at all. In the next Congress, there will be at least 74 new House members due to retirements, resignations, and deaths alone. The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political newsletter that analyzes campaigns and elections, has 39 House seats currently held by Republicans rated as “toss up” or worse, a number that puts Democrats within striking distance of gaining control of the House. Democrats must score a net gain of 46 seats or more to achieve a majority that matches the current House GOP majority, and anything short of a 60-seat gain could present a challenge for House Democrats to achieve policy priorities. However, Republicans could retain the majority, although likely with a smaller margin than it has today, resulting in similar policy challenges. In the Senate, the notion of a Democratic political wave will likely meet a Republican geographic seawall. Democrats are defending 26 seats in November, compared to just nine for Republicans. Of those 26, ten seats are in states won by President Trump, with five in states he won by nearly 20 points or more during the 2016 election. Conversely, just one Republican seat is in a state won by Hillary Clinton. A Pew Research Center study of regular and special Senate elections held since 2013 (the last two election cycles) found that 69 out of 73 were won by the party carrying that state in the most recent presidential election. That’s potentially good news for Republicans, given that every Senate race in 2016 was won by the same party that prevailed in presidential balloting for that state. With the Senate expected to retain a tight majority no matter the party in control, legislative gridlock may be on the horizon following the midterm elections. In gubernatorial races this year, Democrats are defending nine seats compared to Republicans’ 26 seats. The outcome at the state level likely will have an impact on congressional maps drawn after the 2020 census and could reverse Democrats’ decade of state and federal losses. State and local There have been important developments at the state level in the area of professional services taxes. California remains at the forefront of state efforts to impose taxes on professional services and currently has a bill under consideration that ties a narrow tax on professional services to a redistribution of perceived corporate gains arising from the passage of federal tax reform. The bill would impose a tax of .75% on professional services beginning Jan. 1, 2020, which would rise to 1.5% in 2021 and again to 3% in January 2022. While healthy revenues from California’s current economy may have been key in aiding efforts to oppose the legislation, the issue is not off the legislative agenda in California. In Arizona, a coalition led by the Arizona Association of Realtors is seeking passage of Arizona Proposition 126, which would amend the state constitution to prohibit the imposition of professional service taxes by all government entities in that state. The electorate will vote on the measure in the November election, and current polling has it passing. Legislatures across the nation are also responding to the #MeToo movement by passing new laws to address sexual harassment. These bills range from bans on non-disclosure clauses in settlement agreements or employment contracts to outright bans on arbitration in sexual harassment disputes. Some bills bar employers from using arbitration in employment disputes altogether. For example, the New Jersey Legislature recently advanced out of Senate committee a bill that would not only ban arbitration agreements in employment contracts altogether, but also ban concealment of sexual harassment settlements. For its part, the California Legislature recently passed nearly a dozen bills introduced in this area, including measures to extend the statute of limitations on sexual harassment suits, requirements that employers maintain records of sexual harassment complaints, workplace protections for sexual harassment victims, and bans on employment arbitration. These bills await Governor Jerry Brown’s signature. We expect additional states to introduce similar legislation aimed to address sexual harassment in the coming months. SEC and PCAOB Last week, the Senate voted 85-14 to confirm the nomination of Elad Roisman to serve as SEC Commissioner. Commissioner Roisman formerly served as Chief Counsel to the Senate Banking Committee and fills the vacancy left by the departure of Commissioner Michael Piwowar, a Republican appointee. Commissioner Roisman’s confirmation could have implications for the timing of the president’s nomination or the Senate’s consideration of someone to fill the seat currently held by Commissioner Kara Stein, a Democratic appointee whose term has expired and who is ineligible to serve past December. Absent Commissioner Roisman’s confirmation, the SEC would have been left with three commissioners after Commissioner Stein’s departure, potentially giving Commissioner Jackson, a Democratic appointee, the ability to deny the quorum required for SEC action under agency rules. The Senate’s confirmation of Commissioner Roisman means that SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has the ability to move forward with regulatory action after Commissioner Stein’s departure if he, Commissioner Peirce and Commissioner Roisman are aligned. In June, the SEC adopted amendments to the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) requirements for operating companies and funds; released a strategic plan focusing on the long-term interests of Main Street investors; and adopted amendments to the definition of a "smaller reporting company." Under the new definition, a company with less than $250 million of public float will be eligible to provide scaled disclosures, while companies with less than $100 million in annual revenues and either no public float or a public float less than $700 million will now also be eligible to provide scaled disclosures. Recently, Chairman Clayton said he “expects the Commission will be taking a fresh look at the thresholds" for Sarbanes-Oxley section 404(b) over the next several months. President Trump recently tweeted that he asked the SEC to study replacing reporting for publicly traded companies from quarterly to a semi-annual system. Chairman Clayton released a public statement saying the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance "continues to study public company reporting requirements, including the frequency of reporting." The topic also has caught Congress’ attention. In July, the House included a proposal in its JOBS Act 3.0 bill that would require the SEC to study the costs and benefits of the current quarterly reporting system as well as the specific requirements of Form 10-Q. That bill awaits Senate consideration. Any SEC study of this issue is expected to be rigorous and unavoidably time consuming. As such, ultimate adoption of any recommended legislative or regulatory changes will depend on who is in the Congress and/or White House at the time. At the PCAOB, the Board also recently released a draft of its five-year strategic plan, for the first time inviting public comment on its areas of strategic focus in fulfilling its mission to protect investors and the public interest through high-quality audit reports. The new Board intends to drive improvement in the quality of audit services through a combination of prevention, detection, deterrence and remediation, as well as ensure that its inspections and standard-setting activities are responsive to and do not impede technological innovations, among others. Comments for the strategic plan are due in mid-September. Will the good times last? Can they? Any change in majority control of either chamber of Congress is likely to result in further legislative gridlock. A Democratic House majority will likely lead to oversight hearings, investigations, and possibly the introduction and consideration of articles of impeachment, furthering an already toxic partisan environment. The ultimate resolution of the Mueller investigation will likely have significant impact as well. Additionally, an all-out trade war with China has the potential to shake investor confidence in the markets. Although the last year and seven months have shown just how flexible and resilient the markets can be under a healthy US economy and business-friendly political environment, the question remains whether that resiliency can continue with so much uncertainty looming in the months ahead.

It’s something we’ve all experienced, sometimes multiple times a day: You enter your credit card number online to buy something and wonder, “How can I trust that my information is safe?” That’s where Armando Colbourne and PwC’s Cybersecurity and Privacy practice (part of our Risk &amp; Regulatory platform) come in. They’re delivering on our purpose by working with clients to address new and evolving security threats -- helping them build trust in a digital, data-driven world. Here’s more from Armando. Tell us a little bit about your background and your current role at PwC. In my role, I perform privacy and/or security audits (as a third-party assessor) for companies who have either received an order from the Federal Trade Commission or Office of Civil Rights, or are working on their own to better protect the sensitive data they receive from their customers. What role does trust play in your work? Trust is absolutely the most important thing for our clients, and our clients’ clients. Clients have trust in us. I see our job as transitioning this trust to their clients, which tend to be “everyday” people who are giving over sensitive information, such as their credit card number, in exchange for some product or benefit. They wouldn’t do that unless they felt implicitly that their information was safe, and that sense of safety is what we work with our clients to provide. For example, a client I worked with in Australia was a government entity who had a large breach where minors' data was leaked. When PwC came in, the client trusted our team to solve the problem. They knew that we weren’t just in it to make money and push generic work that wasn’t tailored to fit their needs, but that we would be diligent in creating the right solution for them. In what ways do you find meaning -- and purpose -- in your work? What aspect of your work energizes you the most? I love finding ways to do things more quickly and effectively. For example, writing a code or a script that can get something done in an hour and eliminate a lot of extra manual work. For me, it’s incredibly satisfying to solve problems by coming up with new ways of getting things done that are faster and more efficient. Who do you see this aspect of your work ultimately impacting? I see my work impacting my internal team first and foremost -- I like making people’s jobs easier by finding ways to get things done quicker. And then this ultimately impacts the clients because deadlines are met and things are progressing smoothly. We all have relationships with clients and coworkers where we’re building trust in ways we may not even realize -- whether you’re helping online shoppers feel safe, ensuring the integrity of financial systems or being the first people our clients turn to in times of crisis.

Say something See something? Say something Tim Ryan Feb. 5, 2019 Team, As a purpose-led, values-driven firm, we act with integrity every day -- it’s what we do. While I hope none of you has to face difficult or uncomfortable situations here at PwC, I also know that we’re working in a complex environment and no organization is perfect. That’s why I want to remind you that if it does happen, it’s important to speak up. If you’re concerned about a client matter, firm policy or a situation that makes you uncomfortable -- please talk to your coach, partner leader, Relationship Partner, the One Firm Risk Organization or the People Team (HR). You can also report your concerns to the Ethics HelpLine, anonymously if you prefer. Whether you have a concern about questionable time reporting (“eating time”), suspected misuse of client or PwC data, antitrust law questions, possible sexual harassment or another matter, the firm is here to help with the right policies and resources. Your concerns will be taken seriously and handled confidentially. Many of us have completed the Pressures &amp; Demands course -- and it’s now required for all of our people via My Compliance Dashboard. The training is important and the message is simple: We are a firm where the expectation is that everyone treats each other with respect -- and when we see a situation that isn’t right, we speak up. Tim Ryan Understanding what’s expected To refresh your memory on the firm's expectations that we report our concerns, take a look at PwC’s Code of Conduct and the Reporting Concerns policy in Our Standards. And if you haven’t completed your Pressures &amp; Demands training, make sure you take the course, available on My Compliance Dashboard now.

Tax June 5, 2019 Any act of recognition, big or small, has the power to make someone’s day. Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” When it comes to ways to say “thanks,” the Northeast Asset Wealth Management team knows recognition can be powerful when it’s staring you in the face — including on your desk! Here are three innovative ways they’re embracing recognition: Traveling trophies: The group has four trophies they pass among each other in recognition of our values. So whether it’s taking the extra step for a team member, going above-and-beyond for a client, or just kindness that makes someone’s day better, trophies are handed off and proudly displayed in recognition of good work. Gratitude boards: Set on easels by the kitchen spaces, the team uses gratitude boards as a place to publicly leave notes of encouragement and thanks. What a great way to serve additional smiles on your coffee break! Leader lunches: Those who are nominated as high-impact individuals for making meaningful contributions to their teams and the firm will be invited to attend a one-on-one AWM leadership lunch. Pictured from the left: Christine Murphy, Erynne Landry, Cory Chin being handed off the trophy by Haley Evans Looking for more ideas on how to approach recognition? Check out this recent article with 3 tips from Tax. Now: whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

Plus, The habit Tell us: Have you committed a Random Act of Kindness? Plus, The habit refresher People Team Jan. 17, 2019 When we invest in our well-being, we’re better and more energized at work and at home. So as we head into the holidays and the firmwide shutdown, do something kind for someone external to PwC and spend a few minutes with your team to refresh your well-being plans you made last year during the Habit Challenge. If you’re with a different team this year, start the conversation and make a plan. 50,000 Random Acts of Kindness Today, we continue our FY19 well-being journey together with the second of four firmwide Be well, work well events this year -- 50,000 Random Acts of Kindness. Did you know? Even the smallest acts of kindness can make a difference and release an enormous chain of positivity. When a person sees another person act with kindness, generosity and gratitude, they’re much more likely to engage in that behavior themselves. In other words, acts of kindness are literally contagious! How to participate Extend a random act of kindness to someone outside of PwC — with clients, family members, friends or strangers. Our goal is to extend as many random acts of kindness as we can. Note: We will be getting some external exposure with a short ad airing during the weeks of 12/24 and 12/31 on CNBC. Log your random act(s) of kindness and location anonymously at sharekindness.pwc.com to help us track our collective reach. Continue the kindness chain by encouraging your recipient to pay it forward and log the act (if they have the ability to do so) on sharekindness.pwc.com and ask recipients of their act of kindness to do the same, and so on. Share your activity on social media using #bewellworkwell and #bekind. (See our social media guidelines.) Need a reminder? Visit Virgin Pulse and add “Be Kind” to your daily habit tracker. We hope to keep the kindness chain going by encouraging all recipients — as they pass on the act of kindness and log it — to create a ripple effect that crosses borders and transcends oceans. Refresh your team well-being plan, get Well-Being Reward points and prizes, too! It’s been a year since we launched our first firmwide habit challenge as part of our Be well, work well effort. Now it’s time to recommit to your well-being through The habit refresher. Connect with your team, check out the Habit Bank for ideas and acknowledge that you are part of a team (25 max) plan. Here’s what you need to know to get recognized for committing to two habits and sharing your story: Earn 800 points in Virgin Pulse for acknowledging you are part of a team plan (form now closed) between Dec. 18 - Jan. 13. Points will be credited in January. Teams choose two habits and register their plan before Jan. 14. You are encouraged to commit to at least one habit in the mental dimension, as that’s the area we struggle with the most as a firm, according to the Energy Audit. For example, habits can be to meditate, step away from the screen and take a walk, do the most important thing first in the day, or snooze your Chat notifications. Teams will share their team’s experience via a Google form between April 12 and April 22. Teams can keep each other accountable by leveraging Virgin Pulse’s Healthy Habit Challenge Tracker. Prizes will be awarded: Three random drawings with five winning teams in each drawing Select teams (one from each LoS) who share the most impactful experiences win $10K Top 3 social media “well-fluencers” (teams active on social media) win $7.5K. Post your well-being journey using #bewellworkwell and #teampwc (see our social media guidance) What else?

Here’s how one partner led by example and inspired another Recently, Partners Joe Killian (driver) and B.J. Agugliara were on the way to the New York office. While stopped at a traffic light, a homeless woman approached the car and tapped on the window startling them both. B.J. encouraged Joe to roll down the window. A bit hesitant and unsure where this would lead, Joe obliged and B.J. engaged the woman in dialogue. B.J. then reached behind him and pulled out a lunch bag, which contained a sandwich, juice and snacks and gave it to the woman. B.J. promised to keep her in his thoughts and the woman, Michelle, was very grateful for his kind gestures. “After I saw B.J. demonstrate that act of kindness to a stranger, I was changed forever,” Joe said. “I never knew that B.J., at the behest of his kids, often carried an extra lunch bag to work and would give it to the first homeless person he saw after connecting with them a bit.” Ready to spread kindness? Let’s all join in and do an act of kindness to brighten someone else’s day and inspire them to be kind to others. As an added bonus, you’ll brighten up your own day by doing so!

From the point of order, to the production line, to the job site, it was time-consuming and costly to manage the process and meet compliance requirements. We made an invisible technology personal and real for each client user. We created a Magic Moment... In collaboration with our Shanghai Service Delivery Center, we built a blockchain-based prototype that provided a single workflow. We demonstrated the human benefit of what’s often considered a complex technology by making it real for each user in the process. We created “day-in-the-life” simulations to demonstrate how each person involved would benefit in their respective jobs. The blockchain solution enabled greater transparency and less risk for the business. The solution and value we brought Blockchain, Emerging Tech and UX specialists demonstrated how blockchain can transform the supply chain — the number-one use case that execs in our new survey see for blockchain’s application to business. Our Hyperledger-based solution provides an unchangeable, near real-time record for each asset as it moves from point A to point B. Simplifying and streamlining the asset tracking process increases transparency and reduces operational friction. It also provides a trusted record of transactions and inspections to meet regulatory requirements and reduce risk. Have a recent win through BXT? Reach out to Lina Woods or US_digital@pwc.com.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between April 1, 2018, and June 30, 2018, you should contact Nick Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

You’ve been watching the news and know that the US government has recently imposed economic sanctions on Venezuelan entities and individuals. A few questions come to mind. Is this potential engagement impacted by these sanctions? If so, what does it mean for your engagement? You need answers, but who can help? Ethics &amp; Compliance can help. As detailed in the FY19 Independence, Ethics and Compliance training, certain higher-risk countries may require additional scrutiny, such as Venezuela and Russia. Additionally, a few countries including Cuba, Iran and North Korea remain subject to comprehensive economic sanctions. Check this guidance and up-to-date listing to review the embargoed and higher-risk countries. If you haven’t completed your annual training requirement, go to My Compliance Dashboard and complete it today. Be aware of your responsibilities, and consult. A breach of US sanctions rules -- even if inadvertent -- can have serious consequences for you and the firm, potentially resulting in civil and criminal penalties.

With the recent transition to Workday, a few changes were made to how you’ll need to document your credentials. Here’s what you need to know: You’re responsible for submitting and maintaining your credentials or credential exam results directly in the appropriate system of record, based on whether the licenses and credentials are CPA or non-CPA. For non-CPA credentials and all credential exams, including CPA exams, you’ll now document directly in Workday, which replaces the Talent Development database previously maintained by the People Team. Here’s how to document credentials in Workday going forward. For CPA licenses, CPA work plans and foreign accounting credentials (collectively “CPA Licenses”), you’ll continue to document using the Credential Tracking System (CTS). If you submit your CPA Licenses into Workday, the transaction will be denied by the HRSSC Operations team. To avoid this, please make sure you submit your CPA Licenses to CTS directly. If you are working towards your primary credential exam and eligible for promotion, refer to the 2018 primary credential exam deadlines here. An updated credential policy will be released this fall reflecting the change in primary system of record as outlined above. You can read the current policy and find your specific requirements here. If you have any questions reach out to your Talent Consultant.

There are three ways to get our new system to auto-fill the info for you! Activate e-receipts and our system will automatically pull the hotel itemizations directly from the hotel vendor’s system. Another option: Tap the ExpenseIt icon in the SAP Concur Expense app on your phone, and upload a picture of your receipt to add it to your report.

Andres Rodriguez, a manager in US IT, based in the Tampa office, lives -- and loves -- to pay it forward. "I enjoy helping people grow and expand in ways they did not think possible," he said. Paying it forward includes driving messages related to health and fitness -- but topping the list is mentoring kids. Why does he do it? "Because I was that kid,” he explained. “I would have appreciated more chances growing up. I was in awe of key influencers in the world -- and dreamed of opportunities that seemed out of my reach." Knowing what it's like to want a better life, Andres helps today’s youth by teaching financial literacy through Access Your PotentialⓇ and PwC’s involvement with Junior Achievement, a program for students from pre-K through high school where volunteers provide onsite mentoring and teaching. “I don't think I've missed one Junior Achievement volunteer event in the five years I've been with the firm; I want to inspire kids to follow their dreams," he said. He gives back at work, too, whether it's sharing his passion for yoga, tips on living a healthy and mindful life, or just being aware of how we can all help each other in simple ways. A recent trip to the cafeteria even provided an opportunity. "I overheard someone say they thought yoga was difficult and overwhelming,” he said. “I jumped at the chance to share some tips on how yoga, and meditation, helped me on my wellness journey." And when it comes to Be well, work well, that journey even includes providing yoga demonstrations to teams in his office, teaching the basics and how even just a few seconds of collective breathing can help everyone relax in a meeting. "Teams can do this together to find the calm in a situation, then reset and move forward," he said. His interest in others goes deep, and global. Growing up, he lived in 15 different cities throughout the US, as well as Venezuela and Mexico. "I was fortunate to be exposed to diverse cultures, which helped shape my global acumen and ingrained a deeper understanding of others' perspectives, so I can better understand where a person is coming from.” Rest assured, this is all coming from a humble place; Andres emphasizes that we're all a work in progress. "The bottom line is, I try and improve myself on a daily basis -- from within and with the help of others," he said. “When we're in a position to help others grow, whether mentoring or sharing our gifts in other ways, we can all make a difference in an extraordinary way."

Yes, you can attend a Digital Academy session in either your home market, or the market where your client is located. The firm will not reimburse expenses related to traveling to any other market for this training. However, you may expense one night of a hotel stay, and associated meals, if you are attending in the market where your client is located. Please use the following code: 80127251001 (Note: this code may only be used if accompanied by a note from your Relationship Leader or Engagement Partner to US_Digital-Academy@pwc.com approving the expense). I have added my name to a waitlist, how will I be contacted if I am allowed in the course? If a learner is moved from the waitlist to an active registration, they will receive a message from Vantage confirming their new enrollment. Please note that if you are on a waitlist, you can attempt to join the session as a walk-in. We have recently experienced last minute cancellations and no shows the day of training, which is too late to move someone off the waitlist. If you want to try attending as a walk-in, you will need to download the pre-work (install software and download data files) found in Vantage. Attendance is recorded by submitting the attend code provided at the session. What should I do if none of the sessions in my market work for my client schedule? Please also look at the list of sessions in your client’s market if you are unable to find a session in your home market that works for you. If I have registered for a session after March 31, do I need to change that? Yes, our ask is that you drop that session and instead register for a session or a waitlist prior to March 31. How do I change my registration for a class if I need to move to another date? Click here to learn how to manage your enrollment. If I can no longer attend the session I’m registered for, but I can’t find another open session that works for my schedule, should I drop the registration and join a waitlisted session?Yes, you must withdraw from your current registration to enroll for a waitlist on a different date. Click here to manage your enrollment. Please note that given the investment we are making in this course, and given the limited availability of seats, not showing up for a course that you have registered for will result in a note to your Relationship Leader and Coach. How do I un-enroll if I am waitlisted for one session and want to enroll in another? You can only register/be on a waitlist for one session at a time. You'll need to withdraw from your current waitlist spot to enroll for another session. Click here to learn how to manage your enrollment. Are Partners required to complete a Digital Academy session by March 31? No, only associates through MDs are required to complete a Digital Academy session by March 31. Partners are encouraged to do so as well, providing it works for their schedule. I attended a Data Analytics Academy or Forensics Analytics for Everyone course - will this be counted as completing a Digital Academy course? For those who have already taken the Data &amp; Analytics Academy training (or equivalent programs in Deals and Forensics), you do not have to take the Digital Academy. But, please register for a Digital Lab Immersion training, so that you can get the additional piece of this curriculum that was not covered previously. Can I complete a Digital Academy session online instead of in person? At this time, we do not have a virtual Digital Academy option that is CPE-eligible and trackable. We expect to be able to offer this option by the beginning of March. Please note that there will still be a significant time investment needed to complete Digital Academy online. So, our recommendation would be for you to sign up for an in-person session now and then once the virtual option becomes available, you can evaluate whether that would better fit your schedule.

PwC’s standard contract provisions are incorporated in the Tax engagement letter templates found on the electronic tool "CREATE for Tax", which have been approved by One Firm Risk Organization (“OFRO”) Tax and Office of General Counsel (“OGC”). Standard key contract provisions are regularly updated to comply with changes in Firm policy or changes in tax law, regulations and ethical or professional standards. Accordingly, it is important to retrieve the electronic templates when drafting the engagement contract to ensure you are engaging your client under the most recent terms and conditions. Any modifications to the standard terms and conditions in the engagement letter, including changes to the terms and conditions in a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”), will require the approval of OFRO Tax as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process. To obtain approval, mark “Yes” to question 2.1 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment and answer the questions that follow appropriately, providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Question 2.1 Terms &amp; Conditions Changes Are you using a previously negotiated Engagement Letter or MSA that contains nonstandard terms (other than for terms expressly allowed at the engagement partner's discretion pursuant to Contract Guidance for Engagement Teams)? OR Has the Client requested changes to standard Terms &amp; Conditions? OR Does the client have a separate Confidentiality Agreement that does not conform to PwC Policy? Yes No Each Engagement Letter or Statement of Work (“SOW”) issued under a MSA that contains nonstandard and/or changes to terms and conditions will require OFRO Tax approval each time on the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment as part of the engagement set-up process. That is, even if you have received approval from OFRO Tax, Contracting Center of Excellence ("CCoE”) and/or OGC in the past for the term modifications (separately or in a previous Engagement Acceptance Assessment), each engagement stands on its own and requires OFRO Tax approval. Thus, mark this question “Yes”. Certain provisions in our engagement letters (e.g., Scope of Our Services, Client Responsibilities, etc.) may be modified by engagement teams based on the specific client circumstances without further consultation or approval. A good reference for Tax engagement teams is the Contract Guidance for the Tax Engagement Letters which provides guidance for evaluating proposed revisions or exceptions to our standard terms and conditions. It includes guidelines regarding what may be changed, what approvals are required, and provides suggested responses to frequently asked questions.

We’re taking the July 4 week off — AND announcing Learn2earn! Tim Ryan Jan. 7, 2019 Start planning! We’re taking the July 4 week off — AND announcing Learn2earn ... read more below! Team, Last year we asked all of you to double down on your efforts toward Your Tomorrow, and in exchange we closed down the firm for a week in July. You told us you loved having the time off, so we’re going to do it again — with a twist. We’re announcing now that we’ll take the July 4 week off to rest, relax and get ready for the next leg in our journey to become a digital firm. So, what’s the catch? There isn’t one! You told us last year that the only thing that could make the break even better was more time to plan. We’re letting you know now so you can start thinking about how you’ll spend the time. To add to the fun — and help us achieve our goal of having everyone complete all four Digital Quests and earn their Digital Acumen knowledge badges by June 30 — we’re also announcing “Learn2earn.” Join us as we all lean into Your Tomorrow, help add value to our clients, upskill ourselves — and win some money along the way! Here’s what you need to do: Complete all four Digital Quests by April 30 (Note: Our goal as a firm is still to complete these quests and earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30 ... but we’re adding an incentive to beat the last-minute dash to the end!) Earn 150 points by April 30 as an active member of the Digital Lab community, by contributing to and/or using the resources of Digital Lab. Everyone who successfully completes the challenge will be entered into a raffle for up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win (you can read the contest rules here)! It’s our way of saying thank you for going the extra mile on our Your Tomorrow journey. Team, I hope you’re excited — because I am. July 4 will be here before we know it, and by then we’ll have new skills and a more digital firm. And in the spirit of Be well, work well, we’ll be ready to take a break so we stay charged up and ready for even more growth and opportunities! Map out your game plan to Learn2earn We’ve set an important goal for everyone to complete all four Digital Quests to earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30 — and that hasn’t changed. However, we know you like a challenge, and if you want to lead on this important goal, you could be a winner! Everyone who completes the four Digital Quests and earns 150 points in Digital Lab by April 30 will be entered into a raffle to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win! The first two Digital Quests are now available, and the next two will be unlocked in March. Each Digital Quest takes about an hour — plus the time you spend interacting with our Digital Upskilling learning channels to build your digital skills, like PowerUp!, Learning Bursts and Tech While You Trek. And you’ll not only be putting yourself into the running for great prizes, you’ll be investing in yourself and building the knowledge you need as our firm digitizes. You’ll find all the resources you need in the Digital Hub. Contribute ... consume ... and win with Digital Lab Did you know that you can win points that translate into cash rewards by contributing assets and consuming content on Digital Lab? Whether you create a bot in UiPath, download an Alteryx workflow or rate and comment on your favorite data visualization in Tableau, you’re earning points using our Gateway to Your Tomorrow. With Learn2earn, there’s even more reason to start using Digital Lab. If you earn 150 points using our technology-sharing community by the challenge deadline of April 30, as well as complete all four Digital Quests, you’ll be entered to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition. For example, you can earn 10 points simply by submitting a review and rating for an automation. Later this month, you will have the ability to see how many points you’ve earned in Digital Lab and see guidance on the many other ways you can earn points in PwC Inside. And don't worry, any points you've already earned since November 13 will be counted towards your 150-point goal. So, continue to use Digital Lab on your client engagements as well as to make administrative tasks easier, and you’ll be well on your way to completing this part of the Learn2earn challenge! Get ready, get set … start planning! We’re confirming now that the US firm will shut down for the week of July 4. To help you plan, here’s the FY20 US holiday schedule. For the July 4 holiday shutdown, we’ll apply a "give two/take two" approach. That is, the firm will give two additional days, and we ask that staff take two vacation days or floating holidays in addition to the July 4 federal holiday.

Survey says... How can family businesses succeed? Survey says... Private Company Services May 25, 2018 What does it take to succeed as a family business? Since 2002, PwC has been posing questions to family businesses across the globe to find out what factors affect their companies and what they think they will need to do to be successful now and in the future. Past results of the PwC Family Business Survey, now in its 15th year, have been quite revealing. "Over the years, the survey results have helped us understand what family businesses are focused on — from innovation to globalization to just making it past the second generation,” says Jonathan Flack, US Family Business Services Leader for PwC. “It also highlights what may be blindspots for them like updating their business strategy or addressing succession planning.” The 2018 PwC Family Business Survey just launched and will be collecting data from PwC clients and prospects through June 30th. By reaching out to more than 2,500 family business owners in 40 countries across the globe, PwC aims to glean comprehensive insights that will help our clients and prospects learn more about what family businesses are thinking and doing — and allow PwC to uncover ways to help these companies address their strategy, planning, and governance questions and issues. What does your family business client or prospect think? Share the survey! Know a family business client or prospect whose perspective would be a valuable contribution to the survey results? Invite them to participate in the online survey. The deadline for responses is June 30th (all responses are anonymous) with results scheduled to be shared in November. Bridging the gap: Last year’s PwC Family Business Survey revealed a strategy gap between prioritizing long-term future growth and innovation which highlighted the importance of medium term strategic planning to bridge the two.

That’s something we can never take for granted — we’ve seen how quickly businesses can lose trust and how hard it is to rebuild. By consistently living our values every day, each of us has the opportunity to go to bed each night knowing we protected and enhanced our brand. One of the ways we protect our brand is to have a group of people — our Ethics &amp; Compliance team — who spend their time thinking about continuous improvement and how we keep getting better. As a purpose-led, values-driven firm, we do business the right way. Because of this, we’re able to attract and retain great talent, deliver outstanding services to our clients and sustain our trusted brand. Our E&amp;C team helps us enhance this strong culture by providing us with clear guidelines and training on what is expected of each of us, and by supporting us when issues arise. Our E&amp;C team is a talented group of 125 partners and staff from our own lines of service, competitors, Fortune 500 companies and other industries. They are subject matter specialists with extensive backgrounds in areas such as personal independence, ethics and business conduct, investigations and information protection, as well as trade, political and regulatory compliance, among many others. We are not a perfect organization — but we have a lot to be proud of. I recently met with Jude Curtis, who has led Ethics &amp; Compliance for 15 years. Jude will retire in June, so we’ve been having discussions with Jude and Hillary Stanley, Jude’s successor, about how we build on our strengths as a firm and keep improving. We strive to be a firm where people feel they can speak up. This matters because every organization has issues — and we’ve seen stories in the press of what happens when people don’t speak up when they have a concern. We benchmark against other organizations. Based on the data and how we compare to similar organizations, we believe people have confidence they can come forward and be heard. We don’t tolerate retaliation at our firm. We want everyone at PwC to feel safe when speaking up, and we believe most of our people do. A key indicator of how safe people feel when speaking up is whether they choose to remain anonymous when making a call to our HelpLine. While reporting a concern anonymously is always an option, at PwC we have the lowest rate of anonymous reports, by far, of any organization we are aware of. So why is this important? If things are going as they should at PwC, then our annual training, discussions about values and articles in PwC Inside about speaking up may seem like routine administrative activities. But if an issue comes up, that’s when it matters. We want every person who works here to know that PwC is a place where we expect to be treated with respect, can safely speak up if we have a concern, and have very strong and successful processes for providing support. To give you more insight into how we address issues at PwC, we spoke with Jude and Hillary about some of the questions you might wonder about — from what it means to be anonymous to who investigates issues at PwC. And while we appreciate all that Ethics &amp; Compliance does for our firm, we’re all part of building and sustaining a respectful work environment at PwC. If there are situations happening that don’t reflect our values, it’s up to each of us to speak up. If you have questions or need support, you can always consult with the Ethics HelpLine.

Assurance Oct. 18, 2018 In Assurance, our One Firm strategy is how we’re enhancing the quality and value of our core services. We can leverage resources, like the Centers of Excellence (CoE), to standardize, simplify and automate specific tasks that will enhance quality and provide development opportunities for our staff and teams. The Exelon team’s work with the Cash FSLI CoE during the 2018 audit is a great example. After re-allocating portions of the work to the CoE, Senior Associates Carly Turner and Nolan Jones were able to work on a new project that gave them unique audit-relevant experience. They advised and assisted a non-audit client as they prepared and filed a “rate case” -- an extensive process through which utilities justify to regulators the rates they’ll charge customers in coming years. It’s central to our understanding of their business, and a significant area of focus in our audits. “On this project, I was able to assist our non-audit client in areas ranging from assessing forecasts and related calculations to strategizing and evaluating supporting testimony. By working with specialists on this project, I gained a much deeper understanding of the industry, the complexity of rate cases and how they fit into the company’s overall business operations” said Carly. “And now I’m able to bring that knowledge back to my work at audit clients.” Overall, the experience enhanced our skills, developed internal and external professional relationships. It also enhanced our understanding of the “One Firm” approach to our audit and non-audit projects, including our focus on quality and relevance. Even more importantly, it provided Carly and Nolan with new skills that are valuable to their audits and will be throughout their careers. “I worked closely with the accounting and legal departments on a rate case focused on gas. This year I’ll be testing gas rates on my audit client, so now I can take everything I learned and bring it to my audit work. It’s all extremely relevant, and honestly it’s helped me grow into an even more well-rounded auditor and professional,” said Nolan.

We’re conferring with Dell and HP about this issue. In the meantime, check the seams around your laptop, especially just below the touchpad. If the laptop appears distended, or if the case separates as you see below, power down and take it to Office Technology Support as soon as possible. To help avoid this issue, the manufacturers suggest you periodically unplug your laptop and let the battery drain to 20 percent capacity or less.

Associate Krista Moller is a prime example of how we bring this strategy to life with flexibility. Last year, when Krista launched her career at PwC, she hoped it wouldn’t put an end to her singing pursuits. In addition to being an auditor, she sings a capella in a barbershop quartet, C’est La Vie, which recently placed 20th at the Sweet Adelines international competition. Krista’s quartet rehearses regularly and travels to various competitions around the world. “I’ve been singing since I was 9 years old,” Krista said. “I can’t imagine living a fulfilling life without singing. That’s why flexibility played a major role in my decision to join PwC. I’m thankful that the firm is committed to its people and encourages us to bring our best selves to work. I’m able to do that with singing.” While interviewing for her job at PwC, Krista met hiring manager Tina Raether and decided to invite her to a fundraiser for her quartet. To Krista’s pleasant surprise, Tina attended the event with her entire family. It was at that moment, Krista knew PwC would be the place for her. Today Krista credits her colleagues for contributing to her success outside the office. “My team has been supportive of my singing from day one,” she said. “During busy season, our team chooses one night per week to leave early. To accommodate my rehearsal schedule, which isn’t flexible, the team encouraged me to select Tuesday nights.” Krista is grateful to her team for providing the flexibility she needs to pursue her passion for singing. The experience has improved her work productivity and has also helped form a stronger bond with colleagues. “Singing is so meaningful to me,” she said. “To be able to share it with my peers has helped grow our relationships. It’s also improved my time-management skills between client obligations, office activities, training and my singing hobby.” In April 2019, Krista’s barbershop quartet will compete in an international qualifying event in Phoenix. From there she hopes to go to New Orleans for the next international competition. We wish her all the best! #PwCProud Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know.

As you review the following principles, consider their application in light of the type of Tax services you provide and engagements you work on. Proper application of the data security principles will not only reduce the firm's risk of data loss but may also reduce hours in the engagement and hours in your workday. Collect and use only the minimum amount of information necessary for your work If you don't need it, don’t collect it. If the client provides information outside the parameters of your request, return it to the client in a secure manner. Do not add hours to your day and the engagement maintaining data you do not need. Share information with others only as needed Apply the concept of "need to know" and manage access to electronic information (e.g., DMS) in the same manner. Not everyone on the engagement team needs the same level of access. Encrypt all confidential information in external emails and on data storage devices Determine the most secure method to exchange confidential information between PwC and external parties. Encrypt documents sent via email, on USB flash drives, CDs or other data storage devices. Secure information and devices when not in use Protect client information whether in hard copy, or on laptops, mobile devices (i.e., iPhones, iPads, or other cellular devices) or data storage devices. Lock up confidential information and devices when not in active use. Do not leave your computer unattended and in standby mode. Report stolen laptops or mobile devices immediately to US IT. Use only firm managed equipment and email accounts for work related matters Only use personal devices with the firm’s approved secure connectivity software installed to access client and non-public firm information. Do not use home PCs, personal email or instant message accounts, or other nonapproved technologies to access client and non-public firm information. Be aware of how your physical surroundings can put information at risk Secure confidential information by locking file cabinets, promptly picking up printouts or faxes, and by not discussing confidential matters in open spaces. Do not let individuals without proper ID into PwC offices and work spaces. Securely destroy or return information that is no longer needed Do not retain unnecessary information - electronically or in hard copy. Promptly return hard copy files to the Records Center when no longer needed. Return or properly destroy what is not part of your work papers. Retain all information in accordance with firm policies and other requirements. Questions?

Get resources to use in One Firm conversations and preview the findings below. This year’s report, titled “CEOs’ curbed confidence spells caution,” finds global and US CEOs much more pessimistic about global GDP growth in 2019 compared to a year ago (though US CEOs remain an optimistic group in general on the prospects for growth for their own organizations this year). The report explores CEO strategies for transforming their organizations to be positioned for growth, securing the talent they need for the future, and preparing to leverage artificial intelligence and data to create more value. Findings are based on the views of nearly 1,400 CEOs in more than 90 countries (including more than 100 US CEOs), surveyed in September and October of 2018. Be part of the launch Social media will again be key in sharing survey insights and boosting our brand in the market. Sign up for Social Central (now powered by the Dynamic Signal platform) to share approved messages in one click and help spread the word with your networks. What’s on CEOs’ minds Highlights of the survey findings are below; you’ll see that many of the themes tie directly to our platforms -- Cybersecurity, Deals, Fit for Growth, Managed Services, Risk &amp; Regulatory and Workforce of the Future. Access the report at www.pwc.com/us/ceosurvey. Here are three main takeaways: Reality check: Last year, we saw a record jump in CEO optimism for global growth prospects. In contrast, this year we saw a record jump in pessimism, with nearly 30% of CEOs projecting a decline in global economic growth, up from just 5% a year ago. To be clear, CEOs still project positive global growth, but if their past predictive power is any indication, the pace will slow down in 2019. Look inside-out for growth: Global CEOs are adapting to the populist sentiment sweeping the globe. The threats they consider most pressing are less existential (such as terrorism or climate change), and more related to the ease of doing business in the markets where they operate, including over-regulation, policy uncertainty, availability of key skills, and trade conflicts. Mind the information and skills gaps: CEOs are working to bridge the gaps in their own capabilities. Organizations are struggling to translate a deluge of data into better decision making. There is a shortage of skilled talent to clean, integrate and extract value from big data. Despite investments of billions of dollars, a gap remains between the data CEOs need and what they get. This gap, a priority for the C Suite, has not closed in 10 years. Check out these additional resources: Tim Ryan is in Davos sharing updates on Twitter and LinkedIn. He shared a blog giving his thoughts on how business can still grow as CEOs become more cautious. Our internal CEO Survey - Global site will be refreshed as new materials are released this week and in the coming months, including sector reports. Survey results will continue to inform the PwC points of view we’re driving in the market, including the recently released AI Predictions, Top Policy Trends and an upcoming campaign focusing on how PwC can help clients achieve benefits from the 4th Industrial Revolution.

In an age where health outcomes and customer experience are becoming more aligned with business growth, the company looked to collect feedback from nurses to design their future career paths, improve retention and create a roadmap to enhance their people, process and technology capabilities to grow earnings. We gave the client hope and created a magic moment by bringing empathy to the pitch. Our personal and creative approach moved the client and exemplified our understanding of the emotional challenges and motivations of a nurse, allowing us to stand out among our competition - Deloitte Digital, IDEO and McKinsey. Click here to watch the video that moved the client to tears. Our prototype led to a standing ovation and immediate approval to begin the work. The future state we showed in our pitch captured a day-in-the-life story that was shared with VPs across Nursing and HR.

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m Brad Blanchard, a Director in Analytic Insights. I’m based in Dallas and have been with the firm for three years. What's a typical day for you? In my role as a data scientist, I help our line of service teams make better decisions about which clients to target, and why. I spend a lot of time analyzing data, writing code and developing interesting stories based on data. We help our colleagues see that data is more than numbers on a page; it’s something you can actually visualize and relate to when making day-to-day decisions. How did your journey lead you to this role? I became intrigued with how companies, and leaders, make decisions when I was an operational analyst at Fossil. The data science movement was hot, and after getting my Masters in Business Analytics, I took a role at a custom clothing company to help them learn from data. We built algorithms to match body shapes on their website so customers could find the perfect fit. That sealed the deal for me to become a data scientist. I was happy to bring this knowledge to PwC to help energize our leaders about scientifically understanding our clients to further enhance the quality and value we deliver and, where appropriate, improve the experience for our clients by anticipating what they need. How does your team bring quality and value to PwC? Believe it or not, we think of ourselves as creative problem solvers -- and storytellers! We look at data, pull out the facts and decision points, and use them to drive quality and deliver insights for leaders. We love to use data to tell stories that help PwC target clients and devise tailored solutions, all based on scientific analysis. For example, we came up with a way to figure out which companies might be likely to leave their existing auditors over the course of a year, and why. And we’ve built a predictive model that helps us see which companies might launch an IPO, or be receptive to a proposal. These findings really help our firm leaders be proactive and stay ahead of the market! What might we be surprised to learn about you? My wife and I have seven children, all under the age of 10 -- so that keeps us busy. My breakfast specialty involves 16 eggs! We really enjoy volunteering in our community and helped establish a nonprofit to serve refugees who fled Baghdad. We even moved into the apartment complex where the refugees were housed to be able to help them as much as possible. It was a great growth experience for the whole family. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

The sessions are scheduled for June 7, 10 and 17. There will be separate live webcasts for associates and senior associates — you can register to attend in Vantage. This distinct development opportunity will help expand your perspectives on diversity, explore the importance of inclusion as a leadership skill, and examine and commit to strategies that foster our inclusive culture. These skills are important to your growth and development — we expect each of you will make attendance a priority. Our Inclusive Leadership and Belonging sessions are another example of how we’re standing with other leading businesses to foster more inclusive workplaces and communities as part of CEO Action for Diversity &amp; InclusionTM . The 650+ signatories will join us in commemorating the two-year anniversary of CEO Action by engaging in candid conversations with their people about diversity and inclusion. Take action for Inclusive Leadership and Belonging: If you are an associate or senior associate, sign up for a session in Vantage. If you are a manager through partner and are interested in hearing what our associates and seniors are learning, you can register to attend one or both sessions in Vantage. Talk to your clients about CEO Action and take the I Act On pledge to commit to check your biases, speak up for others and show up for all. Join one of our Inclusion Networks to connect with and learn from your colleagues. Our Inclusion Networks are for everyone (members, allies, learners and supporters). Take the HeForShe pledge to stand up for gender equity. Planning to view the Inclusive Leadership Webcast as a group? A few things you need to know. Attend the session for your staff level, especially senior associates; a senior associate must attend a senior associate session to be marked complete. In a group viewing situation, in order to be marked as attended/completed you need to follow these instructions: All staff need to register in Vantage. If you login and watch from your laptop, your attendance is automatically tracked in the system. If you do not use your laptop you need to submit a 'Confirmation of Attendance' form. You can get the form by accessing the PwC Service Hub site and typing 'Inclusive Leadership' or by contacting the HRSSC at 1-877-PwC-Help (1-877-792-4357) or via text chat.

More good news We recently achieved a 45% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to FY07 levels, a full two years ahead of our original FY20 target. Considering our firm headcount increased about 61% during the same period, this is a significant achievement. Many factors contributed to the reduction -- including our ongoing shift to LEED-certified office space, increased mobility and flexible working arrangements, and innovations by our IT team in the way we manage our technology and data. This success demonstrates that investing in working smarter with less impact means we don’t have to choose between economic growth and environmental responsibility: We can have both.

Gail Friend, a Phoenix-based Administrative Support Concierge, feels like she's living a dream. "More like a fairy tale," she says. And she's not kidding. In just one year, she went from sewing crafts as a hobby to becoming a full-fledged dress designer featured in notable fashion shows. How did it happen? "In my spare time,” she explained, “I volunteer as an administrative assistant for the Arizona Apparel Foundation, a nonprofit fashion manufacturer that caters to emerging fashion designers. They held a contest for new designers and I thought it would be fun to create a gown." She won the contest, and since then has become sought after in the fashion world. That’s right -- just like that. "I can't believe it myself,” she said. “It's surreal!" Gail describes her dresses as expressions of art that take the shape and form of fashion. She never uses patterns, and cuts fabric by hand on an 80-foot table. Right now, she's busy creating eight gowns for an upcoming fashion show in September. "It's called '398.2,' because those are the Dewey Decimal numbers for the fairy tale section in the library, and my collection is based on a fairy tale theme," she said. Word is getting around Gail applied for Community Night at Phoenix Fashion Week, one of the most influential fashion shows in the southwest, and was accepted. “It’s rare for someone new to the field to be selected,” she said. “I'm humbled and grateful. People now come up to me and say they love my work and look forward to future designs." How does she find the time? "I sew at night and on weekends; it helps that I have a studio in the Arizona Apparel Foundation and can also use their sewing rooms," she said. She gives back, too, including serving on the board for Fashion Group International; other members include Betsey Johnson, Diane von Furstenberg and Tim Gunn. Gail makes sure to track her volunteer hours to take advantage of PwC's Dollars for Doers program, which allows her to further support the organization. "My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap that exists in underserved communities by helping those in need find jobs in this field." Until then, she's running to keep up with it all. "But I'm not quitting my day job," she assures us. "I love my job at PwC; not only is it the best job I've ever had, it gives me the chance to realize my dreams through flexibility and ways to give back." Update: Since this writing Gail and her photographer began The Edify Fashion Group and spent a year planning a fashion show. Gail is now working on her next collection, Jardin des Amis, French for Garden of Friends, and is currently serving as regional director and president of the board of the Fashion Group International for Arizona.

Through our leadership role in the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™, we’ll engage 1 million people over the next year and give them the chance to become more inclusive leaders. The new Check Your Blind Spots unconscious bias mobile tour debuted in New York City and I had a chance to take a tour. It was an amazing experience that I want to share with you. The video tells the story better than I can, so please take two minutes to watch. We’re taking on an issue that is critical to our future in a very different way, using video, virtual reality and other approaches. We’ll engage our clients, students on campus and our communities with a tech-enabled, gamified experience. The bus will be touring the country -- and many of us will have a chance to see it. In fact you can check out the experience in Los Angeles on December 4 and 9, and in Las Vegas on December 15. I hope you’ll check it out if you can. I think you’ll be proud to see what it’s all about. To expand our reach beyond those that attend the tour, we’ve created the “I Act On Pledge.” This is a personal pledge that anyone can take to help cultivate inclusive behaviors in our everyday lives. I want to ask you to help share this message with the people around you and make your own I Act On Pledge, which anyone can read about and take on the CEO Action website. Think about how you will personally be a more inclusive leader -- and talk about it with your team, with your clients, and with future PwCers, and invite them to join you and also take the pledge. We expect to have 1 million people take the I Act On Pledge over the next year and to reach 1 million people through the mobile unit. But imagine how much bigger the impact can be with all of us -- 50,000 strong -- talking about inclusion and sharing our commitment to keep getting better. That’s our purpose in action!

This agreement is the newest addition to PwC’s Insourced Solutions for Tax service offering (part of our Managed Services platform). Approximately 40 Aon employees will join PwC in May. Background Our xLoS account team for Aon does a great job of introducing our platforms and sharing insights from our PwC journey. All of this has resonated with Aon’s CEO, who is focused on transforming the company for the future. Mirroring our journey, the Aon team has been working on a multi-year Fit for Growth (FFG) project aimed at managing costs and creating investment capacity. Introducing IST Through the FFG process, we helped Aon identify their tax function as an area of focus -- with opportunities to address a complicated global structure and outdated technology, and also leverage top talent. We collaborated with Aon to develop a number of possible solutions including IST, which provides our clients the opportunity to in-source their tax department with PwC. Aon’s CFO and CTO decided a comprehensive operating model change was the best path to follow and evaluated several options in a highly competitive process. After extensive sessions, Aon ultimately chose our IST solution for several reasons, including: Our ability to address their need for top talent Cutting-edge tax technology to drive efficiency and value Our approach to a specialized IST practice This was a huge team effort with a large group of PwC professionals working together and leveraging multiple platforms to help Aon on their transformation journey.

Automation now: Are your clients ready to transform their business? Marketing &amp; Sales May 31, 2018 Automation has been around since the Industrial Revolution. But today, a new class of tools designed to empower business users enables business process automation in new ways. With insights from more than two dozen PwC US and Global leaders, our One Firm perspective is now available. Check it out: “Automation now.” Not sure where to start? These five questions for your client to consider will help guide your conversation around automation, while connecting to your client’s digital transformation journey: Do we understand our business processes and pain points? Are people and culture at the heart of our strategy? Will our efforts be sustainable through robust governance? How is our tech ecosystem evolving to meet our goals? Are we measuring business returns beyond financial ROI? Within technology, the new automation toolbox (see sidebar) includes a broad set of potential tools on a continuum — from the very simple to the highly complex — all of which require varying degrees of collaboration between business functions and IT. Use these resources to start the conversation with your client: Webpage: digital perspective framed around 5 questions Executive summary for printing Talking points: our One Firm talk-track on automation (internal) Sales deck with bold messaging and graphics New Automation Toolbox Social media messages + images RPA training calendar + Spark page Access additional resources via Google or Spark What’s in your automation toolbox? Automation technologies range from the simple, like an Excel macro, to complex, like intelligent process automation platforms. Combining simple and more complex automation technologies creates a multiplier effect with a bigger impact. For example, adding natural language processing to “read” purchase order emails, fill forms automatically and trigger requisition processes. If there are any doubts about AI’s practicality in business today, intelligent automation will put them to rest by applying AI to real-world applications Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/32726.html</url><pwc_title>Madison Avenue meets Mpumalanga in a rhino-sized sabbatical </pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:30:30</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>news-type:Firmwide|source:People Team</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-09-13 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:People Team</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Madison Avenue meets Mpumalanga in a rhino-sized sabbatical Madison Avenue meets Mpumalanga in a rhino-sized sabbatical People Team Sept. 13, 2018 Reaching the senior manager or director level is a significant career accomplishment worth celebrating. As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors, and IFS directors with five or more years of service, are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to disengage, recharge and truly focus on their well-being -- a key component of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Working for a purpose-led, values-driven firm and having an affinity for African wildlife inspired New York-based Director Beata DeZagon to do something radical with her sabbatical. “It’s estimated that only 25,000 rhinos remain in the world, with more than 1,000 being killed each year,” Beata said. “I decided to use my sabbatical time to volunteer at the Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary in Mpumalanga, South Africa, to learn more about the rhino crisis and conservation efforts -- and to help care for orphaned rhinos. My husband was nervous that I was traveling alone, but he supported me because he knows how much the cause meant to me.” After a 20-hour trip, Beata finally reached her destination. “Words can’t describe how I felt stepping onto the world’s largest orphaned rhino sanctuary,” she said. “There were volunteers from around the world, and the staff I met were incredibly selfless and dedicated professionals. “They work 12 days on/two days off and live four hours outside of Johannesburg. Due to strict security measures to protect from poachers, it’s extremely difficult to travel in and out of the sanctuary. So everyone who works there essentially gives up everything else in their life for these animals.” The sanctuary takes in orphaned rhinos from Kruger National Park and other game reserves after their mothers are poached. Volunteers like Beata assist staff in rehabilitating the rhinos and safely releasing them into intensive-protective zones, which are manned by armed rangers 24/7, along with electrified fencing and surveillance technology to deter poachers. “We worked hard every day to dig new drain lines, reinforce the electrified fences and clean the rhino’s bomas (enclosure),” Beata said. “We would feed the rhinos throughout the day, prepping milk and feeding the youngest rhinos around the clock, even at 2 a.m.! We also learned about the use of K9s against poachers, and did a snare-sweep exercise with the anti-poaching team. Poachers place snares in bushes to illegally trap wildlife, which is why the exercise is critical in preventing other animal species from dying. ” Back at home, Beata continues to help fundraise and promote awareness of the poaching crisis -- to help reverse the trend and ultimately prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros. Reflecting on her trip, Beata encourages colleagues to seek new experiences that help gain a sense of perspective. “Working for a global firm requires us to learn about other cultures,” she explained. “We operate in a fast-paced environment. It’s important to slow down and realize how big our world is and what’s happening around us.” Visit our Rewards Strategy site to read more about sabbaticals and learn about PwC's Career Milestone program.

A 529 savings plan might be the way to go, but if you are required to maintain personal independence, it is important to understand the restriction status of the plan and the implications for you. The firm provides audit services to many financial services clients, and as a result, many 529 plans are restricted entities. And that could mean that those plans are impermissible for you. Remember: If you are required to maintain a portfolio in Independence Checkpoint and you’re thinking about opening a 529 college savings plan, check this list of “conditionally” permitted plans first. If you are in the chain of command, you are only permitted to invest in plans found on this list. Everyone should pre-clear any plan you’re interested in, even if it is on one of PwC’s lists. When pre-clearing a plan, use the CUSIP in the lists above as many plans have similar names. And, finally: As with all restricted entities, if you’re a covered person for a plan you cannot invest in that plan, even if it is on the conditionally permitted list. If you maintain an Independence Checkpoint portfolio and already own a 529 plan that is not on one of the above lists, contact the Compliance Resource Center for guidance. Practice staff below manager level are permitted to invest in any 529 savings plan, as long as they do not provide services to the plan. Have questions or need help? The Compliance Resource Center (CRC) can answer your personal independence questions — click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option five inside the US or from outside the US call 1-813-351-6491.

The Platforms Navigator will help you identify the problems our platform teams are helping to solve, recognize key business issues, and equip you to start a conversation with your non-audit client. When you collaborate with platform teams to deliver holistic solutions that go beyond the initial ask, you deliver greater value to your non-audit clients. We’re challenging you to double down on platforms. How are our non-audit clients benefiting from platforms? The Deals platform created a project plan and roadmap to help health services client Envision effectively execute the challenging IT carve out work necessary to divest a subsidiary to private equity client KKR. The work by GEP Kelly King (Envision) and GEP Tom Godward (KKR) and their teams helped position Envision to make better decisions about initiatives to launch during the divestiture and after it's completion. The Deals platform has a full team of professionals who can advise your clients on everything related to deals. And if your client is looking to close the next big deal, strike up a conversation on the latest deals trends by reading the new Deals industry insights. With Insourced Solutions for Tax (IST) from the Managed Services platform, GEP Josh Carter and his team are advising financial services client Synchrony as they reduce costs, while preserving the feeling of having a dedicated in-house tax department and benefitting from our firm’s strong knowledge of their business. IST provides the non-audit client a team across our global network with in-house experience and technologies, to deliver tax services in a tech-enabled, efficient way. The Managed Services team can help you decide if IST is right for your non-audit client.

Team, Last Friday, I had the honor of speaking to a brand new group of accounting professionals as they graduated from the University of Southern California’s Leventhal School of Accounting. As many of you know, I’m an optimist -- and there’s nothing more optimistic than being part of the celebration of talented people who are now ready to go out and make their mark on the world. Our world faces a lot of tough issues. But when I see the many committed, values-driven people -- like you, our clients, and these graduates -- that gives me confidence that we can take on the tough issues and succeed. Among the brand new USC graduates is a new member of our PwC community. Sofia Roberts received her Master’s in Accounting on Friday and spoke to her fellow graduates -- taking the podium just before me. She’ll be joining us as she starts her career. It was a very humbling experience to give the commencement address to these graduates. My advice to them was to remember that as leaders, they lead by example. Others are watching to see if they face tough issues with courage and integrity, if they are inclusive and living their values, and if they are treating others with care and respect. For those who might be interested, here’s my full speech. It was a great day -- and I feel very fortunate to represent our firm and all of you at events like this.

PwC has an obligation to our clients to protect their confidential information from access by third parties, but also to limit the number of PwC employees with access to that same information. We should share client information with others within the firm only when the access is necessary to perform services for which we have been engaged (i.e., a "need to know"). Although DMS has functionality such that personnel can be given access to all jobs and projects performed for a client ("broad client file access" or "client level access"), most personnel do not need and should not receive broad client file access or client level access. Rather, as set forth in the PwC policy on "Confidentiality and DMS Access," personnel who do not have a client level "need to know" should be granted restricted access. (Note: under most circumstances a person who is not in the U.S. does not have a broad "need to know” and therefore should NOT be given head client level access (even if they have a US Visitor GUID)). Access levels In general, partners, managing directors, directors and managers (collectively, "managerial personnel") who have a client level "need to know" (regardless of their geographic location) may be granted client level access. Managerial personnel that do not have a client level "need to know" should be grantedrestricted access. Seniors, associates, and non-managerial personnel (collectively, "non-managerial personnel") should not be given client level access unless they are day-to-day members of the "lead client engagement team" and have a client level "need to know." Accordingly, restricted access should be granted for such non-managerial personnel. Example ABC Inc. is a client of the Boston office. Partner 1, Manager 1 and Senior Associate 1 are involved in several engagements on this client, are the day-to-day "lead client engagement team" members and have a client level "need to know." Several senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office are assisting with a tax return preparation engagement on this client. The senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office are not working on other engagements for this client and therefore do not have a client level "need to know." Client level access should be granted to Partner 1, Manager 1 and Senior Associate 1 because they are the day-to-day members of the "lead client engagement team" with a client level "need to know."

As the joint statement says, “a career in the auditing profession promises to be one of opportunity—the opportunity to learn and grow in a place where diversity, inclusiveness, respect, and doing right by others is not only embraced, but central to our long-term success.” Please feel free to discuss this within your teams. And if our clients or others ask, you can confirm our unchanging commitment to delivering quality and bringing the resources of the firm, in appropriate ways, to the important work that we do each day.

His Career Milestone sabbatical was his chance to show them that he could, indeed, unplug. "I had three goals for my sabbatical: spending quality time with family, seeing a World Wonder and picking up a new skill," Sal said. He achieved all three, and extended his four-week sabbatical to six weeks by taking it close to the firm's year-end shutdown and adding vacation time. Malaysia, Dominican Republic and Peru Sal’s trip began in Malaysia, where he met up with family and explored the country's diverse landscape and culture. He then visited Hong Kong, where he joined some of his PwC colleagues and "crashed" a PwC holiday party. The next stop was the Dominican Republic, relaxing on the picturesque beaches of Punta Cana with friends, exploring the rich heritage of Santo Domingo and ringing in the New Year by staying up all night dancing to salsa and hip hop at a famous nightclub. "The grand finale was one week in Peru, an experience I could have never imagined," said Sal. "I toured the city of Lima, traveled to the Cusco Region, and was in awe of Machu Picchu, one of the Seven Wonders of the World." With everything going so smoothly, it's hard to believe that Sal barely planned his trip ahead of time. "Except for the Malaysia visit, I only had a loose idea of where I wanted to go beforehand and was pleasantly surprised by how it turned out," he said. “Growing up in Palestine, I never imagined I’d be able to see the world like this; I’m extremely lucky." Planning ahead But what wasn't extemporaneous was planning ahead with his teams and partners. "I worked tirelessly over a three-month period before I left to make sure everyone, and everything, was fully covered,” he said. Everyone was supportive, even his clients. “Once they heard me mention seeing my family, and how this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, they understood its importance.” Sal’s teams appreciated the opportunity to enhance their own leadership skills while he was away. "This allowed me to fully unplug,” he said. “I can't thank my very talented teams enough.” So, what was the new skill he achieved? "Being in Latin America allowed me to strengthen my global acumen by recovering my conversational Spanish,” he said. “I’m now working hard to advance toward fluency. When I started speaking they thought I was fluent just from my first few words, so I had to ask them to slow down after that!" Any advice for those who have sabbaticals coming up? "Don't be afraid to take risks, set clear goals and prepare your teams way ahead of time." Reaching the senior manager or director level is a significant career accomplishment and one worth celebrating. As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors and IFS directors with five or more years of service are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to disengage, recharge and truly focus on their well-being and life outside of work.

And, for audit clients, the focus is on using Salesforce as a tool to assist with engagement management. Here’s how some of your fellow Salesforce users are making a difference: “Salesforce allows me to easily measure how my opportunities are progressing and quickly get a status to identify next steps.” “On my Salesforce mobile app, I love that after a meeting as you go out the front door, you can take a note with voice command and save it right into system. It’s so easy and fast!” “To get the most out of Salesforce’s relationship management benefits, I take just a little bit of time -- less than a minute -- to enter contacts and use ‘relate me’ to help connections across the firm.” Here are 6 things you can do to make a difference to Salesforce results and relationships in FY19: Progress those pursuits -- Use the winning practices in this tip sheet to help you leverage Salesforce across the Pursuit phases. Connect your opps -- Salesforce allows you to "relate" Opportunities so that you can easily view and report on Opportunities that are connected. Try this out for phased or recurring work, change orders or pull-through projects. Tag that Platform -- Tagging platforms in Salesforce highlights important One Firm opportunities and trends to leadership. You should designate a platform for each opportunity entered.

According to Bill Gilet, partner and global leader of our Advisory Shared Services &amp; Outsourcing Practice, “Particularly when it comes to issues like shared services and business process automation, clients regularly ask us, ‘how do you do things at PwC?’” In March, PwC showed 110 representatives from 60 companies -- including a number of clients -- how we “walk the talk.” As sponsor of a major shared services industry conference, the firm hosted a large group from the conference for a tour of our Business Services operation in Tampa. “This location is a major hub for PwC’s US internal business operations. Nearly all US firm business processes -- and many global ones -- are either developed or managed here,” said Joe Killian, PwC’s Business Services managing partner. “Our teams provide PwC the same capabilities and sustained excellence our partners and client service professionals offer our clients. We are also reinventing how PwC does business.” During the tour, a team of PwC Advisory partners and IFS directors showcased how we’re putting the principles we tout to work in our own firm. From using bots for automating human capital and hoteling processes to a breakthrough idea-to-innovation approach that enables continuous streamlining in Finance Controller Operations, the team shared the best of PwC’s internal firm services. Leaders discussed our Chief Data Office’s approach to managing the ever-growing data pool. The visiting group even got a peek into our Cyberfusion Security Center and glimpsed our next-level protections against cyber threats. “By showcasing PwC’s internal applications of our own methods, Advisory and IFS were able to give this group of clients and conference attendees a valuable view of what great looks like,” said Bill Gilet.

I want to wrap up the week with a reminder that PwC is committed to advancing an inclusive workplace and society, and we proudly support the transgender community and its allies. We have joined 180 other CEOs and corporate leaders who are calling for respect for all and equality under the law for transgender, gender non-binary and intersex people. You can see the statement here. What we are saying is that treating everyone fairly is the right thing for our friends, family members and colleagues, and it’s also the right thing for our business. Of course, our firm did not wait for this ruling to open up the conversation about creating an inclusive environment for all of our people. Two years ago we published Gender Inclusivity and Transition Guidelines to be clear about PwC's approach to supporting transgender professionals. So, while this isn’t new, I want to remind all of us that these guidelines are in place -- and that our commitment to our people is unwavering. No matter what is happening outside the walls of PwC, we value the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the people of PwC. As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, it’s up to us to work together to be a place where everyone feels they belong, and we support each other so we all have the opportunity to realize our full potential. Our workplace will always be free of discrimination. We will always be committed to our values and to being a diverse and inclusive firm.

Unconsciously, our bias can influence how inclusive we are as colleagues and leaders. The new Outsmarting Human Minds (OHM) podcasts are one way to help develop inclusive leaders and build a firm where we all feel a sense of belonging and value. What’s OHM? With a grant from PwC, Harvard University developed a series of podcasts, videos and other materials that apply insights from psychological science to help us improve the decisions we make in life and at work -- specifically around helping us understand our blind spots. Listen to these three new podcast episodes -- each is only 10 minutes long. Accent Bias: Voices are more than sounds. They’re auditory faces that can give clues to who we are. In the time it takes to say “hello,” we can identify a person’s ethnic or cultural background as different from ours. Yet this can lead to other impressions that are just wrong. How might accents influence our judgments? And what’s the cost? The Standards We Choose: Book-smart or street-smart? Education or experience? We like to think we use objective criteria to make decisions. But what happens when we choose the person first, then use the standard that supports our decision? How might the “pictures in our heads” drive the criteria we choose? Shifting Standards: Leonardo Da Vinci, we would say, is a genius. Yet we might say the same for a puppy that can open a cabinet to get her snacks. Sometimes it makes sense to shift our standards based on context. But are we raising and lowering the bar when we shouldn’t? As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, PwC invests in developing inclusive leaders. That’s why we launched Outsmarting Human Minds (OHM) and blind spots training. We believe challenging our assumptions will help us grow to better understand each other, accomplish even more together (and with our clients) and make an impact on society as a whole. After listening to the podcasts, check out the PwC discussion guide -- and take action. Start a dialogue on how to outsmart your mind and make unbiased decisions. You can also share our external Outsmarting Human Minds and blind spots sites with clients.

At PwC, our commitment to diversity and inclusion ties directly to our values. We’re committed to cultivating an environment where our people feel a sense of belonging. This means we can bring our whole selves to work, we can lead and grow through diverse experiences, and we can make a difference. Our inclusion networks are a big part of that. The Inclusion Networks Hub (powered by Diverst) and mentoring app (powered by Chronus) bring all our market-driven networks together in one virtual location. We’re enhancing our ability to connect and learn from one another, and continue to lead by example. In just a few clicks, you can access and collaborate with our existing networks, which are open to anyone (members, allies, learners and supporters), and drive inclusive culture at PwC daily. Previously, those interested in participating in an inclusion network would need to find their local inclusion email group and sign up to receive notifications of upcoming events and other news. The new Hub provides a single, digital home for all of PwC's inclusion networks, which will allow local inclusion groups to share information more efficiently, while also making it easier for our people to find inclusion networks they are interested in joining. Whether you’re currently a member of an Inclusion Network, are looking to join, or are just curious about our people and their passions, now is the time to start exploring the breadth of information available at pwc.diverst.com. You can join events, view news articles, start a mentoring relationship and much more. Back up … what are inclusion networks? Inclusion networks are affinity groups, networking circles and employee resource groups or ERGs. They are led by our partners and professionals who share a common background or life experience. They’re open to everyone -- members, allies, learners and supporters -- with the goal of helping to inspire and foster a work environment where our people feel comfortable being who they are and feel valued for their input. All inclusion networks have a common vision: creating and amplifying belonging. See these Hub and Chronus mentoring FAQs for more information on the portal and what the networks do. Questions?

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use our technology tools and Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. You may be part of one of the many teams already using bots to automate repeatable tasks and processes. Bots deliver significant and sustainable value in short timeframes, while reducing overall risk and freeing up time to focus on delivering even greater value and quality service. To help us get going, new Bot Immersion Experience sessions are being piloted that immerse users in an advanced training environment that pushes them to build complex bots using UiPath, troubleshoot common errors and learn best practices so they can build confidently. In the Hackathon portion of the experience, teams go from brainstorming a bot idea to building it using the tips they learned. And professional software developers are on hand to help teams work through issues faced. We talked to two recent pilot participants — Sima Riggs and Zachary Revermann — to hear more. Read on to learn more about their experience, as well as ways you can join the robot revolution. Why did you raise your hand for the pilot and what was your impression of the training? Sima: I was completely new to technology before starting my upskilling journey with the firm. With my Digital Accelerator and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) training, I had a good understanding and had built one or two bots but knew I could do more. This two-day immersion turned that understanding into action. Zac: “I have always been interested in anything tech-related. I had completed the initial foundations training and built a few bots, but felt like I had hit a plateau. In this session, I met other bot-building colleagues from across the firm that helped me break that. And, we still share resources and are actively building bots together today.” What were some takeaways? Sima: “The session inspired me to build more. I revisited a bot I had built before the training with the new skills I had learned, realizing it could be more effective and not break as much.” Zac: “I also found other ways to simplify and improve a bot that I was currently working on with help from the software developers. The session sparked a lot of ideas for how to build better bots and utilize additional features within the technology. My Hackathon team from the immersion session is about to submit our solution from the session to Digital Lab. We’re really excited about it and think it could have a positive impact for our colleagues.” How does Digital Lab play a role for you? Sima: “It is so helpful to see how others constructed their bots via Digital Lab. There are a lot of ways to achieve the same outcome with robotics.” Zac: “The competition from the site is a good push for me. I visit nearly every day, sort the feed by upload date, download anything new I see that could be helpful and see how it was built. I actually just redeemed my rewards from the site too, which is a nice bonus. I already have about 10 assets on Digital Lab and am now fired up to do more.” Any advice for other PwCers? Sima: “Complete some of the trainings out there — Digital Lab Immersion sessions or Bot Foundations — and then just start playing around. Just get to building and try different options for solving the problem.” Zac: “PwC has a lot of different learning options you should check out. There is the RPA tool site, Digital Lab, and RPA experts to help with review and more. Start with the basics — take a training to understand how the software works, then write down some ideas for pain points in your daily work and then just try to build it. Nothing is better than the hands-on trial and error.” Looking for more hands-on training on robotics or Digital Lab? Start by signing up for a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion Session in Vantage. Search Digital Lab for digital assets like bots, then download and use them. To access resources that may be able to assist you in building a proposed bot idea, submit your idea via Digital Lab. And as always, visit the Digital Hub for all things Digital Upskilling. *If you have already completed the Level 1 Foundations training in RPA, you can sign up for an upcoming session of this Bot Immersion session pilot on Vantage: Los Angeles April 10-11 Chicago May 28-29 Houston June 4-5 Have you already earned 150 points in Digital Lab, fulfilling that portion of the Learn2earn challenge?

It also can lead to poor eating habits, sleep deprivation or lack of exercise. Want some remedies? See these 20 tips that cover all four dimensions of energy to make sure you stay on track while on the road. Physical Establish a bedtime routine specifically for when you travel (pre-trip, during the trip, on return). Find healthy food options before you arrive at your destination. Research hotel fitness options and create a workout plan. Schedule your day in 90-minute sprints with clear finish lines. Declare a specific end to your work day and stick to it. Emotional Talk to others on the road or at home about the interesting or positive experiences of traveling. Call or leave a video message for a loved one each morning/evening. Schedule time in your travel schedule for the things you enjoy most. Send a note to someone you appreciate, making sure to be specific about why you appreciate them. Load your phone with photos of enjoyable experiences you’ve had recently, music or podcasts you can escape into. Mental Create a packing list you can refer to every trip. Download Packing Pro and other travel apps from PwC’s App Store. Create a priority list in advance with key colleagues and clients you plan to meet. Block 30-90 minutes at the start of the day for your first commitment. Build in downtime to your schedule where you’re completely disconnected from work. Establish a reflection journal to note how you’re managing energy on the road. Share with your team at your next meeting. Spirtual Pack your purpose (discuss this with someone who knows you well). Book your return flight at a reasonable time. Make time for yourself at some point during the day. For example, meditate or read a few pages of your book. Pack items that remind you of what's important. Look for opportunities to volunteer in the areas you’re traveling to.

Here's Do you have contract changes to standard terms and conditions? Here's what you need to do. One Firm Risk Organization April 25, 2019 The engagement contract constitutes the agreement between PwC and the client and is the most effective way to document our mutual understanding of the scope of the engagement, the anticipated deliverables, the fees for our services and the terms under which we will perform our services. PwC’s standard contract provisions are incorporated in the Engagement Letter (EL) templates found on CREATE for Tax, which have been approved by the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) Tax team and the Office of General Counsel (OGC). Standard key contract provisions are regularly updated to comply with changes in Firm policy or changes in tax law, regulations and ethical or professional standards. Accordingly, it is important to retrieve the electronic templates when drafting the engagement contract to ensure that you are engaging your client under the most recent terms and conditions. Any modifications to the standard terms and conditions in an EL, Master Services Agreement (MSA), Global Master Framework Agreement (GMFA), etc. will require the approval of OFRO Tax as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process. To obtain OFRO Tax approval, properly complete the questions in Section 2.2 on the Data Use Language and 2.3 on Limitation of Liability. Also mark “Yes” to question 2.4 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment if you have other changes and answer the questions that follow appropriately; providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Question 2.4: Terms &amp; Conditions Changes Other than for terms expressly allowed at the engagement partner's discretion pursuant to Contract Guidance for Engagement Teams AND other than Liability Limits covered above: Are you using a previously negotiated Engagement Letter or MSA that contains nonstandard terms? OR Has the Client requested changes to standard Terms &amp; Conditions? OR Does the client have a separate Confidentiality Agreement that does not conform to PwC Policy? * Yes No Each EL or Statement of Work (SOW) issued under a MSA that contains nonstandard and/or changes to terms and conditions will require OFRO Tax approval each time on the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment as part of the engagement set-up process. That is, even if you have received approval from OFRO Tax, the Contracting Center of Excellence (CCoE) and/or OGC in the past for the term modifications (separately or in a previous Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment), each engagement stands on its own and requires OFRO Tax approval. Thus, mark this question “Yes”. If you answer Yes to question 2.4, you will be prompted with a question inquiring if you have received an approved OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note from your Regional Tax OFRO Partner for the engagement contract (e.g., an EL, MSA, or GMFA) governing your new engagement. OFRO A&amp;C Exception Notes are formal documents that are issued by Regional Tax OFRO Partners after assessing the nonstandard terms and conditions of the engagement contract and evaluating the incremental risk to the firm for prospective engagements is acceptable. Exceptions should NOT be requested. [Note: OFRO review and approval of your non-standard engagement contract in an email does not constitute an OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note.] If you have not received a formal OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note, answer “No” to question 2.4.1. If the contract (EL, MSA, GMFA, etc.) is amended in any way other than extending its term, the Exception Note immediately expires. Certain provisions in our engagement letters (e.g., Scope of Our Services, Client Responsibilities, etc.) may be modified by engagement teams based on the specific client circumstances without further consultation or OFRO Tax approval. A good reference for Tax engagement teams is the Contract Guidance for the Tax Engagement Letters, which provides guidance for evaluating proposed revisions or exceptions to our standard terms and conditions. It includes guidelines regarding what may be changed, what approvals are required and provides suggested responses to frequently asked questions. For additional information regarding modifications to engagement letter templates and standard terms and conditions, see the Engagement Terms: Requests for Modifications policy. Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

We committed to take action -- and today we see these actions come to life. Leading the business community through a Day of Understanding We asked the signatories of CEO Action for Diversity &amp; InclusionTM to join us in talking openly about diversity and race, and the potential for unconscious bias to hold back our collective progress on building more inclusive cultures inside and outside of our workplaces. Today, “Day of Understanding” conversations are beginning at more than 150 organizations, representing 1,000 locations and 400,000 employees. Guided by our purpose, we’ve shared our experience, insights and resources at no cost to help other organizations get started. I’m very proud to tell you that more than 100 of our PwC colleagues have volunteered to help facilitate these discussions and are representing PwC as a purpose-driven firm in a very powerful way. People across the country will have the chance to listen and understand each other better: to talk about how it feels to be a minority, or how it feels to be in the majority and want to be a better leader, co-worker and ally. These discussions are a great starting point for change within these companies and more broadly. Driving action within the walls of PwC Of course, we know there’s more we want to do within PwC, as well. To be the business we want to be, we must cultivate a firm where we each feel we belong and can contribute to our fullest. Today marks the launch of our Inclusive Leadership and Belonging at PwC sessions for managers and directors. Over the next week we’re holding nearly 300 sessions across our offices, where our managers, senior managers, directors and managing directors will focus on inclusive leadership. And as we work to become even more inclusive, I believe we are honoring Bo’s legacy. While I didn’t have the privilege of meeting Bo, I’ve heard many stories of how he inspired others around him and made them feel welcome and included -- and that’s an essential part of what it takes to be a leader today. If you think about where we’re headed as a firm, I believe inclusion becomes even more important -- so we can leverage the power of our differences along with the power of technology. This development opportunity will help our leaders understand the impact they have and the role they play in creating a sense of belonging for all. That’s how we’ll continue to attract great people to be part of PwC and bring diverse teams and ideas to help our clients find the best answers. Team, one last thought: I’m proud of the investment we’re making in growing inclusive leaders at PwC. But we don’t need to wait for a training to make a difference. As you might have heard, through CEO Action we’ve created the the “I Act On” pledge. You can make a pledge anytime to support the effort on inclusion -- and I encourage you to share this with your teams, friends and clients, and ask them to make a personal commitment. We can all help lead the change towards an even more inclusive PwC and a more inclusive world.

I want to address one question up front. We’ve invested significantly in building up our capabilities because we want to provide great quality and value -- and help our clients solve their issues from start to finish. We’re moving forward in this particular situation because the right set of circumstances exist to allow our Public Sector business to grow and scale to their maximum potential. We believe this is the right next step for our Public Sector business, for our partners and staff in that business, and for the firm. For those who aren’t familiar with it, the US Public Sector business has primarily focused on serving the federal, state and local government authorities in the US as well as certain multilateral agencies. This 1,500-person practice has an excellent brand and client base – and a strong track record of growth. Scott McIntyre, our Public Sector leader, and the entire team can be proud of the strong and successful business they have built. Veritas Capital is a leading private equity firm that invests in companies which provide critical products and services, primarily technology or technology-enabled solutions, to government and commercial customers worldwide. Veritas has a strong brand and in-depth knowledge and understanding of government clients. Their focus on making their portfolio companies more important to their customers by enhancing their capabilities will enhance the brand and purpose of our Public Sector business -- and provide our Public Sector team with a strong platform for career growth. In addition, this opportunity will enhance the great market position that the Public Sector business has today, and provide access to additional avenues for capital to position them for continued growth and success. The transaction also creates investment capacity that will let us do even more with our Your Tomorrow agenda and accelerate the journey to our digital future. Together with Veritas, we have issued a press release and you may get questions from clients or others in your network. Please do not comment on social media or if contacted by the press. If clients want more information, don’t go it alone -- please talk with your partner(s) to determine the best approach. We recognize everyone is very busy -- we’ll provide an update if there are any major developments. And, of course, we’ll be providing our Public Sector team with much more information to help them understand this change, what it means for them, and the opportunities ahead.

What are you doing to protect your clients’ personal data? One Firm Risk Organization Oct. 18, 2018 New laws being implemented globally, including the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require companies to pay closer attention to how they handle personal data. To comply with these laws and meet client expectations about how we protect the personal data they provide in the course of an engagement, PwC has implemented a Network Data Protection Program (NDPP). NDPP provides a consistent approach across our global network of firms for handling and protecting personal data. What is personal data? The scope of personal data goes beyond a few identifiers we may typically consider, such as name, date of birth, home address and Social Security number. It also includes bank account numbers, medical condition information, photos, videos, location history, online browsing history, political opinions, trade union status and other information that relates to an individual. How NDPP changes the way we handle and protect personal data For each engagement that involves personal data, NDPP requires that we document certain details about personal data. Personal data of individuals residing in the EU requires a greater level of documentation including the type, source, access, transfer, storage and use of personal data. For engagements involving high risk EU personal data, consultation with the Privacy Office may be required for developing a risk mitigation plan or performing a Data Protection Impact Assessment. What you and your engagement team need to know and do To facilitate compliance with NDPP, we have embedded a set of personal data-handling questions into our existing engagement acceptance and planning workflow. These questions help identify risks related to the processing of personal data. For Tax and Advisory, questions have been added to the Engagement Acceptance Form (EAF). For audit and attestation engagements, questions have been added to the Data Protection Planning Considerations EGA in AURA (see Audit Alert 18/32). In all lines of service -- limit, protect and respect personal data by following the Information Protection Principles (IPPs). If clients ask about PwC’s approach to handling personal data or compliance with the GDPR, you can share this compliance statement.

Ultimate Software had several business changes, including a failed ERP implementation, a new CFO, and a change in ownership structure and growth expectations. The new CFO took a key leadership position in the entity and determined that a finance modernization initiative was needed to get ready for the growth expected, including a complete ‘digitization’ of the finance function. What was our solution for Ultimate Software? We leveraged the Finance Transformation Integrated Solution to win a rapid ERP implementation (Microsoft Cloud Dynamics365) at Ultimate Software. This win was a combined outcome from the strength of our Microsoft Alliance relationship and our Finance Transformation solution, powered by Microsoft toolkit. We met the client’s immediate needs through our Finance-in-a-Box offering (Microsoft Cloud) and built a relationship with the newly appointed CFO and VP of Transformation to identify the desire for a Finance Target Operating Model (FTOM) and Billing Transformation. While working on the above initiative, we won another ERP Change Management project that involved setting up a Finance Change office and exploring Digital upskilling, M&amp;A and establishing an Integration support office for Ultimate Software. What results will Ultimate Software see using our solution? The results Ultimate Software will see supports our Fit for Growth platform message: organizations need to reinvent themselves to prepare for a faster moving and unpredictable future. By combining phases of work across teams, we will provide Ultimate Software with an operating model blueprint and a refined finance strategy that complements the process digitization they have planned though Microsoft D365. This will support scaling their business to 4 times the current revenue. How is this win significant and what results will we see? The collaboration across alliances, xLos and cross teams, will grow this client from a primarily tax account, to an xLoS account that is a priority in the Florida market.

You update your password and move on. But that’s just the beginning of your trouble. Hackers then try to use those credentials to break into your social media accounts. And if they do, it can create a real mess. They pose as you to phish your followers, steal your personal and financial info and so much more. It’s called credential stuffing, and it’s a nightmare — this is how the drama might play out. Here’s how to protect yourself on social media: Create unique passwords for each platform. To help manage your passwords, consider using a tool like 1Password. Use a complex password. Create more secure passwords by making them long, and use a combination of characters. See PwC’s Password Guidance. Enable two-factor authentication. Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and other platforms offer this option. Secure other accounts. Make sure to use these guidelines to protect your data on banking, shopping or other online platforms. A best practice is to not register or use your PwC email address for personal-use websites as it exposes that firm asset to unwanted and potentially malicious email. Visit Information Security Awareness for more security tips and education. For guidance on using social media, check out the US Public Communications and Social Media Policy. #NIS Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40391.html</url><pwc_title>#PwCIsGo: Did you apply to be an astronaut?

Despite growing headwinds, the ship remains steady Deals in 2019? Despite growing headwinds, the ship remains steady Platforms Jan. 24, 2019 We’re faced with continued changes to the regulatory environment, an uncertain political landscape and early indicators of an economic downturn. Although these issues might normally curb M&amp;A and other deals, the ship looks steady in the year ahead. Our Q4 2018 Deals Industry Insightsreveals a sector-by-sector forecast of what’s likely to be on your client’s mind in 2019: Capital across sectors should keep M&amp;A activity steady From cash on corporate balance sheets to private equity (PE) dry powder to overall debt capacity, business leaders will be able to tap various buckets when they’re ready to make a deal. An uptick in large-scale acquisitions With a wave of megadeals in 2018, overall US deal value increased 28% to more than $2 trillion – its highest point in three years. And 2019 already has seen multiple announced megadeals. Cross-sector interest, but not at the expense of scale While many deals continue to cross industry lines, most 2018 M&amp;A value was in transactions within a company’s sector. In 2018, same-sector M&amp;A accounted for two-thirds of deal volume but more than three-fourths of deal value. Private equity on the rise In addition to a 9% increase in volume from the previous year, PE deal value surged 41% to more than $347 billion – the most since 2014. Sectors drawing the most PE investment by value were tech, media and telecom; real estate; and oil and gas. More money in IPOs IPO volume and value were both up from 2017. In 2018 we saw more than 200 US IPOs, nearly one-third of them in pharma and life sciences. US buyers drive cross-border deals Despite an 11% decline in cross-border activity from Q3 to Q4, deal value rose by 17% last year. This increase was powered almost solely by a 34% increase in outbound US deal announcements. Now is the perfect time to strike up a conversation about your client’s M&amp;A strategy for the year ahead. Familiarize yourself with the Deals platform, and share one of our latest reports: Q4 Deals industry insights Deals year-end review and 2019 outlook 2018 Annual US Capital Markets Watch CEO Survey and Deals New Deal Frontier Deals is just one of our PwC platforms designed to help us address the issues that are top of mind to our non-audit clients.

Tech tip: Passwords — From $#@% to whew! PwC Technology March 26, 2019 Tip 1: There’s an app for that — check out 1Password From Amazon to Zappos, managing your passwords recently got easier with the firm-approved 1Password app. Yep, it even manages your GUID password and other PwC passwords. All you need is … well, one password. The app collects all your passwords in one location where they are protected behind a single “master password.” The app integrates with your Chrome browser and mobile device — so when it’s time to log in, you click a button, enter your master password and you’re in. To get started, download this Quick Reference Guide for PwC’s special registration link, plus instructions to install the Chrome extension (be sure to use your Chrome browser). Once you’re set up on your PC, download the 1Password app from PwC's App Store or Google Work Play (you’ll find it under the productivity category). On the PwC login screen, simply enter your email address and password to get started. Android users, you’ll need to launch VPN before using this app. BONUS: Share the love — when you create your PwC 1Password account, you’re also eligible for a free 1Password Families account you can share with up to 5 family members. More details here. Tip 2: Password presto-o chango! Locked out of your PC? Reset your password in no time using our password reset tool — no need to contact the help desk. Just click Forgot password? on your PC login screen, then follow the prompts. On your PwC mobile phone, you’ll receive a text with a verification code that’s good for 10 minutes. Enter the code on your PC, select a new password for your GUID/Windows login and you’re good to go. To use the password reset tool, your mobile number must be listed in Workday — if it’s not already there, add your number to Workday. If you’re a Mac user, stay tuned for a tool to come soon. Tip 3: Just say the magic word You’ve got a bunch of PwC passwords — and sometimes, you might need to reset something specific. Thankfully, PwC’s Service Hub helps you quickly navigate password resets for specific tools. All you have to do is remember the magic word: passwords/ Simply type passwords/ into your laptop’s web browser and hit return. Be sure to include the forward slash! You’ll be whisked to the info you need — whether it be unlocking your iPhone, setting up a PIN code for Concur Expense or even resetting your SAP UDP/R3 password. #PwCUSIT Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/39556.html</url><pwc_title>Northwestern Medicine poised to benefit from PwC's Patient Experience Integrated Solution and Rapid Innovation</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 11:47:02</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:Advisory|source:Advisory</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-04-25 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:Advisory</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Northwestern Medicine poised to benefit from PwC's Patient Experience Northwestern Medicine poised to benefit from PwC's Patient Experience Integrated Solution and Rapid Innovation Advisory April 25, 2019 What was the challenge Northwestern asked us to solve? Northwestern Medicine (NM) wanted to launch the MyNM App to advance their goal of strengthening and differentiating NM’s relationship with its patients and caregivers. The app was seen as a strategic initiative with the potential to redefine the brand experience for both current and future patients and create an experience that drives foundational loyalty and growth. What was our solution for Northwestern? Through our deep expertise across a multidisciplinary team, we digitized Northwestern Medicine’s patient and caregiver experience, tailoring and personalizing the interactions across multiple touch points. We accelerated the delivery of this mobile solution by leveraging: the Patient Experience Integrated Solution, along with team expertise to provide Northwestern knowledge across areas of healthcare to integrate a mobile patient experience with the whole patient journey in mind; Management Consulting, Technology Consulting, Risk, Cyber, and also our Experience Center and offshore teams to provide the most holistic solution for Northwestern; business process depth across hospital revenue cycle; and, our Consumer Experience platform asset (CXP), part of the Patient Experience Integrated Solution. What results will Northwestern see using our solution? Overall, the results Northwestern Medicine will achieve with our solution supports the Fit for Growth platform message: organizations need to radically reinvent themselves to prepare for a faster moving and unpredictable future. With our Patient Experience integrated solution and FFG principles, we will help NM stand apart from their competition by building brand experience, loyalty and growth. How is this win significant and what results will we see? Rapid execution and market introduction - 6 months from an idea to launch in the app stores - of a best-in-class mobile solution for NM patients. Provides cutting-edge capabilities like wayfinding and advanced doc search and multiple integration points into a unified experience. Immediate adoption and continued week over week adoption of the app. Northwestern now has capability and capacity to execute on their own and established mobile application development practice for the organization. Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

Here’s a roundup of tech tips and reminders to help you save time and lay the groundwork for a more streamlined audit process. Aura Read these time savers for rolling forward last year’s Aura file and be sure to read the related Alerts: Release of the 2018 Aura libraries and the associated working practices Further enable use of the new Aura libraries (and avoid common pitfalls) by accessing these brief do’s and don’ts Get extra leverage: use SDCs to help with rollforward and other administrative activities Now REQUIRED: Use of the Aura IT dependencies functionality for PCAOB engagements with periods ending on or after December 15, 2018. (Refer to PwC Audit 3301.1). For a smoother setup in Aura, read these key reminders and tips. Remember the SDCs can help with setup activities, so get your reservations in now. New Evergreen templates simplify the process of documenting certain information year after year. For clients who have adopted ASC 606, information on new revenue FSLIs is included in Alert 18/14. Connect Connect v3 is here -- and it features some notable enhancements like faster document upload and download speeds, greater visibility across your portfolio with a new cross-site dashboard, and Aura integration! We recommend you transition to Connect v3 as soon as practicable. For calendar year public engagements, this will likely be either before or after the Q2 review is completed. (Note: Connect v3 is a separate website from the current version of Connect (v2.7). You can continue to use your existing Connect site (v2.7) until you and your client are ready to transition.) Leverage the transition materials on Spark, including information on how the SDC can assist, and reference our materials on explaining the change to your client. Connect Audit Manager and companion tools Connect Audit Manager is available for use on all multilocation engagements to simplify and streamline interoffice coordination and communications for group and component teams. Client Base is a central place for entering data points needed for a new Connect Audit Manager site. If you haven’t already, set up your Client Base template (and remember that the SDC can assist with the set-up and administration of Client Base and Connect Audit Manager). Connect Instructions Tool assists in creating group instructions for PwC component teams through the completion of a series of questions and prompts. Your responses to these questions and prompts drive the creation of interoffice instructions and appendices that are in accordance with the applicable auditing standards (ISA, PCAOB and AICPA) and PwC audit policies (Global and US). EMT Everything you need to know about getting your recurring EMTs done (deadlines, TEA considerations, GDM expectations and EMT360 reminders) can be found in the FY19 Recurring Engagement Pricing &amp; Planning document. Halo for MLA Scoping Does your team create Appendix B? Our new interactive, visualization tool -- Halo for MLA Scoping -- assists in creating the Appendix B based on the input and judgement applied by the engagement team reducing the time spent in the preparation of the quantitative summary. The new tool facilitates the step-by-step process described in PwC Audit 1703.4 and PwC Audit (NP) 1703.4, and automates certain manual elements of the financial analysis. Then, Halo provides real-time visualization of the impact of your scoping judgments and helps create multilocation audit scoping documentation. myIC Verify that your final report release date entered in myIC is appropriate since myIC will stop tracking new individuals once your completed confirm is past your final report release date. The date can be updated as often as you need before you reach the date entered in myIC. When creating a new confirmation only include the current year’s contract and WBS codes DocuSign Use DocuSign to electronically send and sign engagement letters and management rep letters for US-based audit and attest clients. DocuSign is mobile, so right on your device, you’re getting reminders (or your client is) and the process is moving along faster than it ever has (and it’s secure). Count Teams measuring inventory should use Count (except for those relating to Retail Inventory Method). Remember that even if counters are unable to use the Count mobile app during an observation, the Count Portal can still be used by engagement teams to coordinate the observation and counters can submit documentation using the Count desktop app following the observation.

Once you complete the challenge, you decide how to finish the rest of the mobile-enabled training. There are two versions to choose from: one that’s CPE-eligible, and another containing shorter learning modules that isn’t eligible for CPE. You only need to complete one, so decide which one you’ll take depending on your CPE credit needs. If you’re a manager or above and don’t need CPE credit, you can test your skills and save time -- pass a knowledge assessment in lieu of the course requirements. Want a sneak peek? Watch the short video below with Jude Curtis, US Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer, and Sam Burke, US Partner Responsible for Independence, as they explain the new, engaging format for this important Core Compliance Requirement.

Here’s how one team was able to lean on our staff at the Service Delivery Centers (SDC) to meet their deadlines and exceed expectations during crunch time. During the 2017-2018 mutual funds audit cycle, the Vanguard Group - Mutual Funds team relied heavily on the SDC to complete certain test of details procedures and financial statement tie-outs. In a collective effort, the team and the SDC was able to identify and migrate multiple testing areas, such as additional amortization and derivatives procedures. The SDC supported the team in successfully incorporating a new fully electronic financial statement tie-out process, which reduced the number of hours staff spent preparing hard-copy references to be filed with Records Management. The SDC team went above and beyond in the transition of testing procedures. They delivered a quality of work that was consistent with the professional standards and brain-stormed ideas to develop more efficient methods for testing while maintaining the same if not higher, level of evidence. The open lines of communications allowed the two teams to develop a global relationship and act as one. Just as we all put out a call for help during crunch times to any resources with availability, we should leverage our SDCs as a powerful team of colleagues to support certain portions of the audit. This further enables enhanced quality, more time to address areas of potential or increasing risk, and the development of professional client relationships to enhance audit execution. For more on the ways the SDCs can support your team, visit them on Spark.

Learn more. Second, during the year end audit process -- think through what you’re doing, how you’re doing it, and how these tasks might be changed or enhanced using these technologies and tools And finally, capture your ideas real time. Look for more details in January on how you can easily share your suggestions during your engagements Then, in the spring, you’ll know where to prioritize our citizen led innovation, taking your team’s ideas and moving them from vision to reality.

As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, PwC invested in continuing to develop inclusive leaders. Challenging our assumptions will help us understand each other better so we can accomplish even more together (and with our clients) and make an impact on society as a whole. Last year, we introduced blind spots training, based on leading research by Dr. Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard University. The training was all about understanding unconscious assumptions that can potentially shape our perceptions, decisions and behavior – and our ability to be effective leaders. Because of the importance of acknowledging our potential blind spots, we made viewing our 4REAL video training series a condition for new hires and promotion in FY17. We’ve also made a very visible statement by leading the way in creating the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™. But we know there’s much more work we want to do. Welcome to Outsmarting Human Minds (OHM) -- another opportunity to continue learning about blind spots, and to engage our teams and our clients along the way. With a grant from PwC, Harvard University developed this series of podcasts, videos and other materials that apply insights from psychological science to help us improve the decisions we make in life and at work. To be clear, OHM doesn’t take the place of the 4REAL series; rather, it is the next extension. These modules include: About face: Our faces broadcast information about us: whether we’re smart, warm and trustworthy. How do these signals affect decision-making -- and are they accurate? Who are we helping?: Humans help each other all the time. So what’s wrong with helping? Operating on autopilot: Expectations help us quickly navigate our world. Yet they can also keep us from the simple solutions, talent, and opportunities that are right in front of us. Moral credentialing: We work out, then pig out. We donate to charity, then indulge in retail therapy. Does this also happen with our deeds? How can we avoid using moral scorecards? The mind of the beholder: You perform well at work one day, but not the next. One person sees you as “warm,” another as “cold.” Maybe it’s you -- but there is another possibility: that a belief in one person’s mind can shape another person’s behavior. Irrational attachment: We overvalue the things we own. It’s fine if it’s a family keepsake or memento -- but how does this influence decisions we make about our homes and investments, and more? What you can do The first step is to complete the 4REAL (Recognize/Explore/Act/Learn) series. This self-guided video curriculum was created to help people make better decisions and foster inclusive actions. It’s required for all new hires and anyone seeking promotion. (4REAL content is for internal use only.)

For almost 20 years, Let’s Get Ready has provided high school students from underserved communities and first-generation-to-college students with free SAT preparation, admissions counseling and other support services needed to enter and graduate from college. While Let’s Get Ready has mastered its delivery of SAT prep programs to underprivileged students, in order to grow, the organization needs to be more effective at capital campaign fundraising and raising awareness of it’s coaching and mentoring programs to attract more participants and donors — and that’s where Skills for Society came in. As Managers in Tax with MBAs, experience managing a team, and knowledge of business marketing concepts, creating Let’s Get Ready’s new marketing strategy was well aligned with our background and expertise. We were excited to share our skills and volunteer our time with the organization. To create the marketing strategy, we interviewed Let’s Get Ready’s key stakeholders and compared the organization’s current online presence and social media platforms to its peers. We discussed with Let’s Get Ready potential technology platforms and add-on capabilities the organization could use to fully optimize the use of technology and enhance its marketing initiatives so donors and students could login, donate, check resources, ask questions and further engage with Let’s Get Ready online. We also shared techniques to centralize and streamline campaign management, prepare email blasts and reports on marketing effectiveness, analyze social networks and provide insights on what individuals are saying about Let’s Get Ready to drive more informed business decisions. As part of the project we had a very memorable conversation with a Let’s Get Ready alumnus who grew up in an underserved community and spearheaded the Let’s Get Ready program at his high school. He explained that the program taught him how to believe in himself because — while many low income students believe that higher education is not made for them, Let’s Get Ready breaks down these barriers and helps students realize “that they can belong”. This conversation put the project into perspective for us: we were not simply helping Let’s Get Ready with a marketing strategy, we were working with them to give more high school students the opportunity, resources and ability to live their dreams. This mindset allowed us to break out of our typical tax and accounting background and pushed us to think outside the box when it came to the organization’s marketing strategy. For example, we recommended that students write thank you cards and create videos to send to the donors highlighting the impact of donor dollars. One of the stakeholders we spoke to described Let’s Get Ready as an organization with a purpose that “pulls at your heartstrings,” and that is exactly what it did for us. We completed the project with a sense of fulfillment and renewed energy, wanting to continue to contribute to society through purpose-led efforts and different application of the skills we use everyday with our clients.

Juniper networks is a software corporation that develops networking products and network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology. They were interested in transitioning to a subscription based business model and had a goal to attain 20% subscription revenue within 4 years. What was our proposed solution for Juniper and how did we win? In support of our Fit for Growth value proposition to help clients create an environment for change to happen and culture to evolve, the team leveraged the Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) Integrated Solution to delight Juniper. We did this by: Showcasing industry highlights &amp; repeating success stories at SaaS Transformation. Conducting 3 day workshops (leveraging XaaS accelerators) to help Juniper evaluate its Product Portfolio, Operating Model, Readiness Gaps and Solution Vendor selection steps, and Customer Journey prioritization and planning. Highlighting experience from similar XaaS transformations With our deep expertise in the XaaS space, we were able to help our clients understand the difference between prepaid, postpaid, and consumption based subscription models. This triggered our clients to rethink their product and go-to-market strategy. What results will Juniper see using our solution? Robust operating model that enables Juniper to successfully attain 20% revenue from subscriptions over the next 4 years Alignment across required company functional areas and co-build the operating model Customer experience that rivals what competitors provide and customers expect Meet the team!

The military is a running theme in Gretchen Cahill’s life, and that’s just fine with her. A manager in the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO), Gretchen said, “I always knew I wanted to serve my country, yet as a child I thought I would have a career as a public servant. But when a family friend suggested an opportunity to attend West Point US Military Academy, I was hooked.” After graduating from West Point, Gretchen attended flight school and the Army stationed her in Germany. Her dual dedication to flying and patriotism dovetailed when she served as a Blackhawk helicopter pilot during the Iraq invasion in 2003. “Initially, our unit completed deep insertions, where we placed soldiers behind enemy lines,” she said. “We also conducted search and rescue missions for missing or injured soldiers. Eventually, we coordinated routine flights around the country where we transported soldiers safely between locations.” Gretchen jokes that her unit served as a glorified taxi service. “But we really did provide the safest way to move troops around the battlefield.” The work was important on many levels. “Transporting our soldiers safely in the air allowed them to avoid the growing concern of improvised explosive devices on the ground.” Her unit also supported missions to destroy weapons caches. “We flew above vast Iraqi deserts to support the Apache gunships with our long-range radios tying back into headquarters as their pilots reported and destroyed weapons caches,” she said. She and her husband Paul, who was also in the military, had back-to-back deployments abroad at the same time. The two ultimately returned stateside to resume military service. “I coordinated operations planning for air assault missions at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for the 5th Battalion, 101st Airborne Division,” she explained. “The air assault missions involved soldiers rappelling out of aircraft and carrying equipment across battlefields.” Gretchen left the military after seven years to stay at home with their children. When the family later moved to Washington, D.C., Gretchen attended a local women's military academy networking event where she spotted another female West Point graduate at the PwC recruiting booth. “She basically said, ‘Come join us’! It didn’t take long to see that PwC was the right choice for me.” After six years on the Public Sector team leading change management efforts for PwC clients, Gretchen sought to find another position in the firm. “We had just relocated to Hartford and my Public Sector position required me to be at the client site in Washington, D.C.,” she explained. “PwC’s Veterans Affinity Network helped me navigate the firm to find a tour of duty in Advisory Risk and Quality, which ultimately led to my current, full-time IFS role on the Quality Reviews &amp; Monitoring team in the One Firm Risk Organization.” Gretchen remains grateful for her military experiences and the shared values of the armed services and PwC. “The support of the firm has been there since day one,” she said. “They understand and respect the ongoing commitment of our military veterans, whether flying a helicopter or sitting at a desk!” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

Let's go! Badge FOMO? Let's go! HQ News June 5, 2019 We’re well on our way to meeting our goal of everyone at PwC earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge — nearly 31,000 of us have already earned it! If you aren’t one of them, what are you waiting for? You have one month left to up your digital game and help us meet our FY19 Digital Upskilling goal of everyone earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30.

You’ll find learning assets curated specifically to help you prepare for each Digital Quest. Make time for the Digital Quests by using these links to block time on your calendar — adjust them to a time that works best for you: Digital Quest 1, Digital Quest 2, Digital Quest 3, Digital Quest 4. After you complete the four Digital Quests (they can be completed in any order), you’ll receive an email outlining the next steps to claim your Digital Acumen knowledge badge. You can expect to receive your badge via email within six business days. Ready to share your badge? Use this guide. (As a reminder, this PwC Inside article outlines do’s and don’ts for sharing on social media.) More digital badges will be available in FY20. For more information about our Digital Badge Program, visit the Digital Badges site. Digital badges in email signatures Adding your Digital Acumen knowledge badge to your email signature is a great way to share your commitment to Digital Upskilling with your colleagues and clients. This page provides guidance on how your signature should be configured and customized. You can also use the new email signature bot in Digital Lab. After a few questions, the bot applies the brand-approved email signature template — including preferred social handles and Digital Badges — in the right format/fonts. Please keep in mind that brand guidelines do not permit the addition of any graphics, including the badge graphic, in email signatures.

In this PwC Inside series, we’ll introduce you to PwCers who have embraced Digital Upskilling and are helping us build the skills we need to thrive in a digital world. Today, meet Jay Rodriguez and Jason Ashenfelter. Each has a unique story that we hope will inspire you to increase your own digital acumen. Jay Rodriguez is an Assurance associate from Philadelphia who, in his own words “... strives to identify technology-created efficiencies in audit approaches and testing procedures.” By participating in a Digital Academy and utilizing resources in Digital Lab, Jay learned to work with data-wrangling tools that helped him build a model to standardize reports for his large financial services client. The tools also greatly reduced the hours required on the back end of the project. Jay’s model eliminated human error and greatly increased the quality of the work. Additionally, he took a 100+ hour workload per year end -- there are eight annually -- and reduced it to 10 to 15 hours in subsequent year ends, with the delivery of results moving forward more than seven days. A short while ago, Jay would have said that technology was his greatest weakness. Now, with some quality time invested each week in building his digital acumen, he feels technology is his greatest strength. Jay’s advice to those who work on a process that could be simplified or standardized? Don’t be afraid to rebuild proven models. Another tip: Jay found online technology communities provided quick solutions to complex data-analysis issues. Jason Ashenfelter is a director in the Advisory Financial Services Regulatory practice, based in our Cleveland office. Jason is both a digital student and teacher. He began building his digital knowledge via internet sites like YouTube and Khan Academy, later becoming a Digital Accelerator. Now, he's shown his client ways to leverage bots -- automating the analysis of thousands of documents -- and trained his team to use them. This has enhanced our value proposition with our clients by advising on opportunities to leverage technology and integrating digital solutions into our internal processes. Jason advises: “Although our Digital Upskilling journey may appear to be a tall order now, we should consider other digital solutions that at the time were new and unknown, such as our Google suite of products. Over time, these tools have become second nature. It’s only a matter of time before the new solutions being introduced through Digital Upskilling will, too.” Want to build your own digital skills? A good place to start is the Digital Hub, the home to all things Digital Upskilling. You’ll find pre-reads to get ready for PowerUp! games, Learning Bursts, Tech While You Trek podcasts, Digital Quests and more. And don’t forget our FY19 Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal for everyone at PwC -- earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests on or before June 30, 2019. As an added incentive, get an early start through Learn2earn by completing all four Digital Quests and earning 150 Digital Lab points before April 30 and you’ll be entered in a raffle for a chance to win up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition — 1 in 7 will win! New Digital Upskilling lock screen coming for Windows PC users! Next week, a new Digital Upskilling lock screen will be pushed to all Windows PC users in IFS, Advisory and Tax. (It will be pushed to Assurance Windows PC users in April.) The new lock screen will not override a customized one, so if you’d like to see the new one, make sure to turn off your customized settings.

One of these solutions is Digital Crime Fighters, a combination of apps, models, bots and dashboards to fight financial crime (money laundering and fraud) as part of our Risk &amp; Regulatory platform. PwC's Financial Crimes Unit is the industry leader in Financial Crimes consulting. We bring a multi-disciplinary team across the globe, with unparalleled depth and breadth of services, talent, and relationships: Recently, the team helped non-audit client UBS with an engagement to reduce money laundering risk. The innovative, digitized approach took 10,000 hours out of a 80,000 total hour engagement by doubling down on automation. Just one example: the team created a bot to comb news articles for “bad guys” to identify negative information and summarize it using machine learning and natural language processing. The team also used a fixed pricing model. In just 4 months, this One Firm team of 110 partners and staff from Forensics, Consulting, Tax and Audit came together to make a tremendous impact. The client was pleased with the cost and value, and using this pricing model also improved margin on the engagement by 10 points compared to if we did the work manually and incurred the time on this fixed cost project.

Platforms Jan. 21, 2019 Guiding clients through complex situations is one of the many ways we help our clients position themselves for future success -- and our current regulatory environment is no different. You don’t need to be a policy specialist to start a conversation with your client. We’ve got you covered with new resources like our Top Policy Trends report and PwC’s Risk &amp; Regulatory platform. Your client may not even realize the potential impacts public policy could have on a digital transformation or workplace planning project, for example, and the opportunities they may want to seize. Here are the top four things to watch for on the policy front in 2019: Less clarity -- and more risk -- as policy making gets more fragmented. Companies are operating in a world of policy fragmentation, which is increasing costs for business and creating new risk. “Digital megaphone” and public sentiment exerting greater influence on policy making. A new player is entering the policy-making competition: the individual en masse. Social media has become a digital megaphone, capable of amplifying the voices of citizens and groups and making them viral. New strategies for addressing policy risk. Smaller policy-making bodies in states and localities now demand close attention. This requires a new approach to prioritizing and focusing limited government affairs resources and more focus on demonstrating results. The upside of policy competition. Increased policy competition could lead to a positive outcome: policies that better balance the demands of diverse stakeholders and that are implemented in a more efficient and effective manner. Our Top Policy Trends report addresses policy questions in three big areas affecting businesses: global trade, data and privacy, and the 4th industrial revolution. All of which have implications for clients, spanning supply chain, tax, Deals, operations and digital transformation -- just to name a few. Understanding emerging policy trends has never been more important, and our platforms can help identify the solutions that will help your non-audit clients make the most of them. So how can you get up to speed? Read the report, then join our webcast on Jan. 31. Connect with our Strategic Policy Advisers team about how your non-audit clients can take advantage of uncertainty in these divided times and create a proactive strategy for managing policy risk. And learn about all of our platforms, which shape how we go to market around the issues that are top-of-mind for our clients. While a full platforms solution is not appropriate for audit clients, they can still benefit from insights and thought leadership, including Top Policy Trends.

IFS continues to make significant contributions to our strategy, the strength of our firm and our Your Tomorrow goals. As you read in Tim Ryan’s article in today’s PwC Inside, our business is strong and we’re making tremendous strides in digitizing PwC. We’re tracking slightly behind our revenue and engagement margin goals, so we all need to do our part in helping to manage costs and in using technology and automation to work more efficiently. Your efforts make a difference! Speaking of technology, I also encourage you to give special focus to your personal digital upskilling journey over the next several weeks. Remember, we’re all aiming to earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badges by the end of the fiscal year -- with a special incentive to complete that goal by April 30 through Learn2earn. Finally, please join me Tuesday, April 16 for our IFS all-hands webcast, live from Tampa. If you haven’t yet, please respond to the invitation that’s already on your calendar (and if you don’t see it, click here to add one). Our agenda includes: A firm strategy update An IFS-focused digital upskilling and automation update from Alex Chen, Global Delivery Model Services Leader, and panel discussion/practical advice from three of our IFS colleagues: Fabiola Nunez, Mexico Controller Operations Senior Associate; Dmitriy Meleshko, Accounting &amp; Financial Reporting Manager; and Bryant Pena, HRSSC Business Services Project Manager An engaging session about diversity and inclusion, including helpful strategies and actions we all can take to be more inclusive -- led by Paula Theus, New York Metro Market Diversity Leader A spotlight on our Administrative Services team and discussion with Rose Littlejohn, Administrative Services Leader Plenty of time for Q&amp;A, as always! Thank you for all you’re doing to help drive our success. I look forward to talking with you Tuesday! Sincerely, In FY19, PwC will realize our goal of becoming a truly digital organization -- and you play an important role. Let’s keep our focus on these three areas: Across IFS, we’re embedding One Firm behaviors and thinking into our everyday work. Let’s keep up the progress in promoting the use of One Firm tools like Salesforce and delivery through our platforms -- critical components of our strategy and our firm’s success. Consider all lines of service and IFS in your planning, and explore our IFS site to better connect across our teams. And remember that regardless of your role, taking a One Firm approach will help you build relationships, grow your business acumen and enhance your development. Thanks to all of our IFS team members who have been involved in continuous improvement initiatives this fiscal year, making life easier for everyone across the firm. Just three examples of many: We’ve enhanced our Rapid Engage client and engagement startup tool, introduced Request It to simplify Procurement orders, and released the latest version of our Phoenix workflow platform to simplify and streamline the way we engage with our service delivery centers. (Our IFS transition from Envoy to Phoenix begins this summer.) Team, I know many of you are contributing to our simplification efforts within your own functional groups and across IFS and the firm. Please keep up the great work and keep the innovative ideas coming! We’ll continue our discussion about digitizing the firm and upskilling ourselves during our IFS All Hands webcast next week. Make sure to join to hear practical advice for making the most of your own journey. We’re making great progress -- thanks for your efforts and enthusiasm! Digital Upskilling: More than 12,000 of us across the firm have already earned our Digital Acumen knowledge badge by completing all four Digital Quests in the Digital Hub. You have just a couple of weeks left to participate in the Learn2earn challenge to be eligible for up to $1,000 in Real-time recognition. All you need to do is complete the four Digital Quests and earn at least 150 points in Digital Lab. (Our deadline to earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badges is still June 30 -- Learn2earn just provides a little extra incentive to get it done early!)

Read on for tips from the team to get the most out of our new client acceptance and engagement startup tool. Rapid Engage overlays our existing client and engagement acceptance systems (including A&amp;C, AFS, Create, myEngage and others), providing one interface that helps you complete required process steps and track your progress. Rapid Engage doesn’t change our existing client acceptance policies and procedures -- it just makes the entire process easier for you. Rapid Engage reminders: When will my opportunity appear in Rapid Engage? The tool launched in phases across the firm in August. From the date the tool launched to your business unit, any newly created opportunities that move beyond the “Target” stage in Salesforce will appear in Rapid Engage. If you’re a member of the opportunity team in Salesforce, those opportunities will be automatically displayed in your Rapid Engage landing page. They’re also viewable to anyone in the firm using the search bar. Start with the “Engagement Details.” Once an opportunity is in Rapid Engage, one of your first steps should be to provide basic information about the engagement and team in the “Engagement Details.” This info will then be used to auto-launch Engagement Acceptance Forms and Authorization for Services, as required. (You should no longer launch your own EAF or AFS.) Have a contract that originated outside of Create? For contracts or statements of work drafted outside of Create, our engagement letter creation system, reach out to "Ask OFRO" for assistance completing this step for now. Create will soon be enhanced to allow you to upload a signed document and complete the contracting step in Rapid Engage. We’re continuously improving processes behind the scenes. Rapid Engage has already enabled improvements. Learn more now about: How ADS requests are now initiated via Salesforce for new clients of the US and Mexico. What to do when the results of your ADS requests are returned to the engagement partner. Our simplified client acceptance process for accepted clients of member firms. Need to go deeper on client acceptance and engagement startup? Understanding how the behind-the-scenes processes work will make it easier for you to get the most out of our new Rapid Engage. If you ever need more on our processes, check out the “Client &amp; Engagement” section of the One Firm Risk Organization portal. More enhancements are on the way, and access to Rapid Engage is coming for Mexico later this year.

In addition to having two daily habits — hydration and stepping away from the screen — the team is using Instagram to spotlight individual members and inspire others. “With 25 people on the team, we thought the daily, individual spotlights were a great way to build relationships by getting to know our colleagues on a more personal level,” team lead Kristin Szkrybalo said. “It’s amazing how you can work with people and sit in the same office, yet know only a few things about their work and personal life. The Instagram account has brought us closer together in a fun way.” When The habit refresher was first announced, the team quickly assembled to get a head start on their habits and build momentum before the official start in January. “We hold each other accountable through Instagram in an engaging way,” Kristin explains. “For example, to promote our hydration and stepping away from the screen habits, we post creative photos using the hashtag #HydrationHeroes.” After The habit refresher ends, the team plans to continue with their healthy daily habits and use of social media. They encourage others to set realistic well-being goals and support one another in finding balance. “It’s always busy,” Kristin said. “Taking care of your health should be a top priority. Your ability to perform at your best depends on it.” Follow the team on Instagram to see how they keep up their well-being habits and profile fellow PwCers. We hope their story inspires you to embrace Your Tomorrow. Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know!

Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? Laura Didyk, Executive Assistant in Transaction Services in the New York office. I am retiring this month after 42 years with the firm. How would you describe your career journey at PwC? I joined PwC as a secretary in the Tax practice in 1976. The term executive assistant was not used at that time. I was recruited by PwC directly from secretarial school. My title was "manager's secretary." I reported to six managers and loved it. I switched from Tax to Transaction Services 28 years ago when the partner I supported moved to mergers and acquisitions. If you told me on my first day here that I would stay for 42 years I would have never believed it. But PwC is a place to truly grow your career, your knowledge -- and even your friendships! I’ve always appreciated the way you can take charge of your own career with the support of those around you. The people here have really made the difference for me. How has technology changed over the years, from your standpoint? The job I had when I first started would be unrecognizable today! Time and expense reports were done by hand -- and answering phones was a big deal in the days before voicemail. You had to write detailed messages on slips of paper. We used electric typewriters and carbon paper to make copies -- it was a highly intricate process. Tax returns were all completed manually back then, so we worked a lot of overtime filling them out from January to April 15. People recorded letters using dictaphone tape machines, for transcription at a later time. Or, they dictated letters and we used shorthand and typed it later. And, of course, there were no laptops back in those days. I’m impressed with the firm’s commitment to becoming more digitally fit -- it’s a very exciting time! What other notable changes have you seen? When I first joined, everyone got two weeks of vacation. That extended to three weeks after six years, and 22 days after 15 years of service. I've seen such a wonderful increase in benefits over the years with things like flextime, telecommuting and parental leave. Another good one: Before direct deposit, you picked up your paycheck from the cashier’s department. So, if you were going on vacation, you had to make arrangements to get your check ahead of time. We also had an airline department on premises that printed airline tickets for business trips. There were no security guards checking badges -- and no turnstiles in the lobby, you just walked right in! Overall, I love the changes and improvements that I’ve witnessed over the years. It’s been a home for me, and even though I will miss it, I’m looking forward to staying in touch with the wonderful friends I have made along the way. What are your plans for retirement? To do nothing for one month! After that, my husband and I are taking a cruise through the Panama Canal. It's a promise I made to him long ago; we are both very excited about it. Do you have a colleague or team that’s delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

Read more below to be sure you’re taking full advantage of all the things we’re doing to operate as One Firm, simplify and tech-enable our business, and develop the digital skills we need to succeed.When I look at all of the ways our IFS team contributes to PwC’s success, I’m tremendously proud. Thank you. You’re making a difference. I want to share an update on our Annual Performance Bonus program. Each year, we recognize your performance and contributions -- and give you the opportunity to share in the success of the firm -- by rewarding you for your impact as we all contribute to our One Firm strategy. As Tim mentioned, we expect to have another strong year if we deliver on Your Tomorrow. Your Total Rewards Summary in the Me@PwC app provides the target bonus ranges for your specific level within IFS -- as well as insight into the earnings potential across levels. The Me@PwC app is for US staff only; this app is not available to US partners or interns, residents of Puerto Rico and Mexico, or US staff on international assignment. PwC Mexico staff can view their Total Rewards Summary in Spark: Me@PwC Funding of the bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Paying at, above or below the bonus target ranges will be determined by whether we meet, exceed or fall short of our goals. Managing Directors will continue to have their own Annual Performance Bonus program, which will be communicated separately. In addition, I want to call your attention to some of the important things happening between now and the end of 2018: In the next few weeks, we’ll have news for you about an exciting new program: our IFS Leadership Milestone Experience. The next Firmwide Town Hall takes place Oct. 30 (check your calendar for the invite) -- please make it a priority to attend. We’ll be placing a hold on your calendar for our next IFS all-hands webcast, Dec. 5. I know we all enjoy getting together virtually a few times a year to focus on our work and people in IFS and I’m looking forward to connecting with you then. For the first time, this year Mexico will conduct mid-year reviews in their IFS functional areas, teamed up with the IFS People Team. Thank you again for all you’re doing to help drive our success -- for the contributions you’ve made so far this year and for the enthusiasm you’ve shown as we embark on our next steps. This is an exciting time for the firm and for all of us! In the meantime, please read on to see how we’re delivering against our FY19 goal of becoming a truly digital organization and be sure to take advantage of the many resources shared below. In FY19, PwC will realize our goal of becoming a truly digital organization -- and you play an important role. Let’s keep our focus on these three areas: Your work to embed One Firm behaviors and thinking across IFS and the firm makes clear that our strategy and the strength of our business matter to you. In my interactions with IFS teams over the last several months, I’ve seen firsthand how you’re breaking down silos and approaching challenges in new ways. Let’s keep it up! As you’re working on projects or process improvements, ask yourself if you’ve considered all of the lines of service and IFS in your planning, and whether there are ways to achieve even greater synergies. Promote the use of One Firm tools, like Salesforce, and delivery through our platforms. Check out the new IFS site to better connect across IFS teams. Remember that, regardless of your role, taking a One Firm approach will help you build relationships, grow your business acumen and enhance your development. Every day, our IFS teams are working across the firm to help deliver innovative solutions that provide greater value for our clients and a simplified experience for our partners and staff. The launches of Workday, the One Firm Risk Organization, Rapid Engage for client and engagement acceptance, our new SAP Concur Expense system, Mobile Only and contracting tools like Create and DocuSign are just a few examples of important initiatives that will free up time and make our lives easier. Be sure to take advantage of these as appropriate for your role, and encourage others to do so as well. Within each of our IFS functions, we should continue to identify processes that can be automated, streamlined or simplified. As Tim mentions, together we’ll bring Your Tomorrow to life in FY19. IFS already has 153 Digital Accelerators leading the way in taking IFS and the firm to the next level of digital enablement. And we have a number of exciting things on the horizon to further tech-enable our business and give each of us the opportunity to develop the digital skills we need to succeed. Digital Upskilling: The new Digital Hub (available for Mexico in 2019) houses everything you need to build your digital skills. There, our US team can find resources to help you reach the leaderboard in PowerUp!, insightful Tech While You Trek podcasts and more. Coming soon are informative Learning Bursts and details about our new, two-day Digital Academies (open to everyone!).

Our Digital Story can help you do just that. (Spanish version here.) Be well, work well is here to stay: Last week in the US, we began our FY19 well-being journey together with the first of four firmwide Be well, work well events this year -- PwC On the Move.

Level-up your digital skills and conquer the first Digit Game on, PwC! Level-up your digital skills and conquer the first Digital Quest HQ News Dec. 7, 2018 At last week’s firmwide town hall, Tim Ryan outlined what’s next for all of us as we move forward on our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling journey. Starting today, we’re launching the first of four Digital Quests! Ready to get started? Test your digital knowledge by taking the first Digital Quest, the SquadFuel Project. It’s simple: Go to the Digital Hub on your laptop or mobile device and click on “Digital Quests.” As a firm, we’ve set an ambitious but achievable goal for everyone to complete all four Digital Quests by the end of FY19 (June 30, 2019) and earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. Learn more about the Digital Acumen knowledge badge and our Digital Badge Program. Each Digital Quest will take approximately 60 minutes to complete and is eligible for one CPE credit. A few things to know: You can start and stop the Digital Quest at any time, but you can’t go back. So before you click “Next,” be confident in your decision. There is a quiz at the end of each Digital Quest. You must get four out of five questions correct -- but if you don’t pass, don’t worry. You can brush up on your skills and take it again. How do I prepare for the Digital Quests? If you’ve been playing along with PowerUp!, listening to Tech While You Trek, and completing Learning Bursts, you’re on your way! You can also find learning resources specific to each Digital Quest on the Digital Quest page of the home of all things Digital Upskilling -- the Digital Hub. We know you have many things going on -- let’s all aim to complete the first Digital Quest by the end of December so we’ll be one step closer to earning our Digital Acumen knowledge badges! And get ready for the second Digital Quest, covering artificial intelligence, machine learning and data modeling, expected to be released next month. So head over to the Digital Hub today to continue developing important digital skills crucial to PwC, Your Tomorrow and all of us in our fast-paced and ever-evolving digital world.

IPS leadership joins the fight against hunger! Advisory April 29, 2019 Did you know that 40% of New York City (NYC) households lack the income needed to cover basic necessities like food, shelter and childcare? This sobering statistic prompted one of our vertical leadership teams to repurpose their evening activity, roll up their sleeves and take action. While gathered in NYC for their quarterly meeting, the Industrial Products &amp; Services Extended Leadership Team carved out time to help those in need. IPS Vertical Leader, Jenny Koehler, kicked-off the event with a heartfelt message that emphasized our firm’s values, and the importance of leading with a service-driven mindset. The team then headed to their workstations, turned up the tunes and worked together to produce over 500 brown bag snack packs! Shortly after the event, City Harvest, NYC’s largest food rescue organization, picked up the snack packs for distribution to youth and seniors throughout NYC.

Say it IS so! A deck with no words? Say it IS so! Advisory Aug. 31, 2018 They say a picture is worth a thousand words. The TMT staff council kept that saying in mind while “pitching” their FY19 TMT staff engagement initiatives to the TMT leadership team (LT) last month. As the team met, debated, discussed and planned how they could drive overall staff happiness and engagement this year, they also grappled with how they would pitch their ideas to the LT the following day. “We need to show the LT how all of these initiatives are intertwined,” said David Sapin, the Risk and Regulatory GTM leader for TMT who also happens to be the staff council’s partner sponsor (and huge proponent of the BXT philosophy). Realizing that the typical readout of tactics and next steps might fall flat, David continued, “What if you guys went in with NO words on slides and did it Pecha Kucha style?” The eyes of those in the room who had been through a BXT Accelerator lit up. Michael Callahan, TMT staff council lead and former BXT Accelerator winner, got the team quickly to work. He directed them to start snapping “action shots” of how their proposed initiatives would enhance the TMT culture from the staff’s perspective… not the logistics and level of detail they normally would draft. After a few quick practices (and a lot of laughs), the team huddled in an elevator ready to confidently tell their story. While they didn’t do a standard Pecha Kucha (which is 20 slides with no words timed to run every 20 seconds) their whole presentation was only 16 slides and took 15 minutes to present. “Leveraging Pecha Kucha allowed us to focus on the story instead of the slides,” said Robbie Voigtmann, Director on the Digital and Technology Innovation GTM team. “Instead of 30 slides and 55 minutes of presenting we had an interactive 15 minute presentation with 45 minutes of conversation!” Congrats to the TMT staff council for a successful meeting and best of luck with your change initiatives this year -- which were all approved!

We’re happy to report that on June 30, Melissa became the 175th person in the world to complete the Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming. By completing three impressive marathon swims totaling 69.7 miles, Melissa etched her name into the record books while also maintaining a full-time schedule at PwC. We caught up with Melissa for a chat about her Triple Crown victory. How did the firm’s Your Tomorrow strategy -- including Be well, work well and Digital Fitness -- support your pursuit for the Triple Crown? Your Tomorrow was a huge influence! Marathon swimming requires sacrifice in every aspect of your life and impacts all four dimensions of energy. Understanding how the four dimensions fuel well-being with Be well, work well helped make my journey possible. I was able to proactively communicate and execute a plan, which I worked on with my career coach, market leaders, engagement teams, clients and HR Talent Consultant to gain the flexibility needed to achieve my goals. Additionally, through the firm’s investment in technology, I was able to use many of the new PwC apps to work on-the-go. For example, I completed a Snapshot and synched my time on the apps before swim training and the start of the work day. Tech enablement at the firm has directly impacted my work-life balance for the better! Speaking of flexibility, what advice do you have for people who are still trying to make it work? Flexibility is different for everyone. Regardless of your desired arrangement, the key is to communicate your proposal and find a compromise that works for everyone. It didn’t happen overnight for me. I needed a plan with enough wiggle room to handle unforeseen changes in training, work and life. Project management was huge for me, because I was able to take what I learned at work to build a plan for my life, which largely included my swimming. What lessons did you learn in your journey that make you a better PwC professional? This is a great question and something I think about all the time. At PwC and in life, I think we are afraid of things like failure and poor decision-making. Achieving the Triple Crown has taught me that my investment in myself innately makes me a better worker because it has removed the fear of uncertainty and making mistakes. When that stress fueled by fear is removed, you can grow, learn and evolve and connect with others through your personal story. Fear of mistakes is often what separates us from achieving our true potential. Now that you’ve completed your Triple Crown, what’s next? I’m going to take a year off racing to relax, recuperate and focus on enjoying the water again! Training more than 35 hours a week, in addition to work, took a lot out of me mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. It can be easy to lose sight of why you do what you do, why you love your sport and the little things that make every day special. That’s why I’m just going to relax for the next year and swim for the joy of it. There are a few shorter swims I want to do next year -- Alaska, Hawaii, and Lake Tahoe -- but I’m not planning any big swims again until 2020. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: Talk with your teams about your well-being and flexibility needs, even during busy times. You don’t get it if you don’t plan for it, so hold one another accountable! Our Flexibility2 site provides tips and best practices. Melissa’s marathon swim training ground in the Puget Sound off Alki Beach in West Seattle, the water temperature ranges 45-58F year-round. Swim supplies, feed prep, swim strategy and logistics final run-through with her crew the evening before the 20 Bridges Manhattan Island Marathon Swim.

Desiree Martin del Campo is a prime example of how we bring this strategy to life through flexibility. Desiree never dreamed of completing a single marathon, let alone 50 half marathons. It all started in 2009 when Partner Andrew Gaudin noticed she was tracking calories on a sheet. Taking an interest in his colleague’s wellness goals, Andrew proposed they enter their names into the NYC Marathon lottery. Having never run a day in her life, Desiree was hesitant to say “yes”, but considering the low likelihood of winning the lottery and wanting to appease her partner, she accepted the offer. Little did she know, this was going to be the beginning of a life-altering journey that would take her through every state and each dimension of energy — physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. “The only time I ever ran was after an ice cream truck,” Desiree jokes. “Running was an activity that never appealed to me. The thought of running a marathon never entered my mind. But Andrew was so enthusiastic and determined, I couldn’t say no. I figured if it was meant to be, it would happen.” Desiree and Andrew were both selected serendipitously in the lottery. With only six months to train, Desiree had to make significant changes to her daily habits. “Training for a marathon takes an enormous amount of time and effort, especially when you’re as fast as a turtle,” Desiree jokes. “My team would allow me to work flexibly so that I could leave the office early to train. They also provided me protected time on Fridays which was tremendously helpful in trying to balance my professional and personal commitments. The daily runs during the week began to have a positive ripple effect on my life. For the first time ever, physical fitness was becoming a serious focus of mine.” After completing the NYC Marathon, Desiree felt inspired to continue running. In fact, she would go on to run nine half marathons by the end of 2010. It was at this point that Desiree decided to do one in every state. “Thanks to my colleagues and the firm’s flexibility, I was able to travel across the country,” she says.

Each month we’ll recognize a member of our Tax practice who is living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” Shadel Cortorreal, Atlanta Tax Associate While everyone at PwC has been great, bringing me coffee, holding open doors, etc., Shadel Cortorreal has gone above and beyond. Shadel lives in midtown near me and we ride to the client site each day. When we arrive at the client, she gets my wheelchair out of the trunk, puts it together and pushes me to the audit room. When we leave, she pushes me to the car, helps me get in, and loads my wheelchair (sometimes the drivers don't even get out of their car or offer to help her.) On our way home, I get dropped off at my apartment first, so she unloads my wheelchair and puts it together and pushes me to the apartment lobby. I realize that I can make it to any client without help. However, I also realize that I benefit because Shadel is here to help. I don’t have to ask for her help, she just does it. In a world where people can sit by and do nothing, she does something and I am grateful. -Adam Felts, Associate Looking for more ideas on how to approach recognition? Check out this recent article with 3 tips from Tax. Now: whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

The Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax earnings each pay period in a WageWorks account. In turn, you use these pre-tax dollars to pay for work-related transit and/or parking expenses. In fact, using pre-tax dollars for expenses you’re already paying for can save you up to 30% of your commuting costs because you save on federal taxes, state taxes (in most states) and FICA. 2019 monthly contribution limits The IRS governs pre-tax commuter benefits. For 2019, the pre-tax contribution limits are: $265 per month for transit expenses and $265 per month for parking expenses.You can start, increase, decrease or stop your contribution amount at any time throughout the year at wageworks.com. Maximum parking/transit account balance Starting on Mar. 1, parking and transit account balances at WageWorks will be limited to a maximum of $1,000. If you have both types of accounts, you can have $1,000 in each. Monthly payroll deductions will be stopped if your account balance(s) exceed the $1,000 maximum. You will then need to enroll in payroll deductions again, once your balance(s) are spent down. Learn more For more information about enrollment and eligible expenses, or to elect or change a contribution amount: Visit wageworks.com. Call WageWorks at 877-WageWorks (877-924-3967). Representatives are available Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. Review the Commuter Benefits Program Description. If you are logged into myKcurve, click here. The Commuter Benefits Program is available to active US staff receiving US pay only. The following are not eligible to enroll in the Commuter Benefits Program: interns and temporary employees, partners and principals, and staff of the Puerto Rico and Mexico offices. We strongly encourage Flexibility2TM Talent Network staff not to elect participation because of the timing of benefits. If elected, reimbursement generally can only be made for eligible expenses while employed with the firm. Any remaining funds are forfeited.

This is a big part of Your Tomorrow, and it’s something you’re going to see becoming a reality during FY19. As with everything we do, I want to make sure we all know why we’re doing this. It goes back to listening to our clients. They want more value -- and data is the fuel that drives innovation and value. It also goes back to listening to you. You want to develop skills that make you more valuable and, as we become world-class at using data, your value grows, too. To put it another way, our ability to put data to work is part of our plan to stay relevant and secure the future for our firm and all of us. So let me break down how we’re taking this big idea and making it real. To start, we're building a single, global data platform. Right now we have many different data repositories. With the new platform, we get the benefit of scale, a consistent approach across the firm and enhanced security. This platform will help us with our engagements. The tools we use every day, like Halo, Tableau and Alteryx, will be integrated with the platform. It will be faster and easier for us to acquire and work with data, to drive quality and uncover insights that add value for our clients. Building this platform also opens up massive opportunities for us. For example, with clients' permission (more on this below), we can securely store their data and combine it with data that we create, and third-party data. Over the next few years, we will bring that data together with advanced technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence, giving us the potential to innovate and create completely new service offerings. We're investing in building the data platform -- and in all of you, as well. Our ability to innovate with data is only possible if we have the skills needed to put this powerful platform to work. That's why digital upskilling is such an important part of Your Tomorrow. Of course access to data is critical, too, which is why we’re beginning to seek permission -- transparently -- from our clients to use their data beyond a particular engagement. With their permission, we can de-identify and securely store their data, obtained or developed during an audit, tax or consulting project; aggregate it with data from other clients, PwC’s data and third-party data; and use it in a controlled, secure manner to power innovation at PwC. The way we get agreement to use client data for secondary uses is to make it part of all of our engagement letters and Master Services Agreements. Starting now, our partners, and directors and managers who are helping to lead engagements, will discuss this with clients as we issue new contracts or when existing client contracts are up for renewal. Last, we’re issuing a new Client Data Use Policy. The updated policy outlines the guardrails in place to manage the risks that accompany secondary uses of data and -- importantly -- protects the confidentiality of our clients’ data. Handling client data securely and confidentially will always be our highest priority. This policy goes hand-in-hand with the capabilities of our new data platform, so that we continue to enhance our ability to handle data with care and integrity. So what does this mean for you? It means great opportunities to learn and grow -- and a few specific things we need you to do. If you have responsibility for client contracts or Master Services Agreements, please get educated on the new contract provision and the tools we have in place to support your discussions. Our Client Data Use site has a wealth of resources to support you, including videos, FAQs, and a document you can share with clients to explain how we use and protect their data. Our new One Firm Risk Organization and Chief Data Office are standing by to offer support. We need people who know how to handle data and use our tools to uncover new insights. From data academies to digital upskilling, many of us are on our journey to building new skills and many more will be developing these skills over the course of FY19. Get to know your role in treating client data with care and integrity. All of us will need to get familiar and comply with the new Client Data Use Policy. Team, we’ve already started this shift on data. To be clear, we already have teams doing great work with data; our goal, over time, is to pivot from doing this in pockets to using data at scale, across all parts of our business. So lean in and understand why this is important. We’ll be doing interesting work -- and meeting our clients’ demands for more value and a digital experience, too.

PwC’s independence gives our clients, our regulators and the public confidence in our ability to act with integrity, objectivity and impartiality. And failing to maintain independence can have serious consequences for you as an individual, the firm and our clients. That’s why it’s on each of us to stay current with our independence policy. Check out our overview below highlighting updates to PwC’s US Independence Policy and consider whether these updates have an impact on you. Then, visit the fully revised US Independence Policy on our new One Firm Risk Organization portal for full details. And see our One Firm Risk Organization Independence page if you have any questions. New policy on use of client data for internal or commercialization purposes. This new firm policy (adopted in USIP in August 2018) provides guidance around when and how we can re-use client data obtained when providing an audit or non-audit service. See USIP 6000.5. Revised policy on approving Authorisation for Services (AFSs) for new fund audit clients. Where a partner on a new fund audit in an existing fund audit client group is also the group audit engagement partner (or partner in charge of the investment company complex), AFS approval for the audit is not required, subject to certain criteria. SeeUSIP 4060.11. Clarified policy on timing of PCAOB Rules 3524/3525 audit committee pre-approval. The requirements of PCAOB Rules 3524 and 3525 must be fulfilled at the same time as audit committee pre-approval is obtained for the underlying services. See USIP 4100.32. Revised guidance on analyzing the permissibility of investing in non-audit clients. See USIP 5390.1. See our One Firm Risk Organization Independence page if you have any questions. For a complete list of changes made to our US Independence Policy since the last update, see the Revision Table of changes at Section 10000 of USIP or access redlined versions. For a link to the "track-change" and "clean" versions of the updated policy, see the US Independence Policy on the OFRO Portal.

So many of you have told me that when you look at the world today you feel a growing sense of urgency and drive to help others facing tragedy, hardship and inequality. We're fortunate to be part of an organization that is investing to create opportunities for today and for the future. The forces of change that we’re responding to are also widening the gap between those who have opportunities and those who do not. As a purpose-led, values-driven organization, we have the ability -- and responsibility -- to “mind the gap” and address it by giving and working for change together. We do not do this alone. I’m so proud of the difference we make as we give through Impact Space. Year-round, tens of thousands of us collectively contribute more than $35 million to causes we care about, showing our communities, our colleagues and our clients how we live our values. Those dollars translate to caring: $415,000 supporting each other’s crowdfunders, over $1 million helping rebuild communities devastated by last year’s hurricanes and wildfires, and $12 million addressing inequity in youth education. Those are just some examples from 2017 alone. Giving back to our communities and society is a core part of our PwC culture and purpose, and your generosity and leadership make our firm stand apart. No matter the size of your donation, giving back is something you can do right now -- and it takes just a few moments -- to put your personal values of caring and making a difference into immediate action.

You see SLAN uses Excel spreadsheets to manage configuration data before uploading en masse into the application. The team recognized right away that the amount of repetitive manual Excel activities not only increased chances of human error, but also exposed the project to timeline delays. “The solution was looking us dead in the eye,” said Manish Dharnidharka, TMT Advisory partner on the project, “but the problem was, no one on our team had the time or the full knowledge to build a solution themselves.” “We reached out to some contacts we had on the Digital Lab team, explained our problem and we quickly got to work,” added Richard Cebula, managing director in our TMT vertical. Digital Lab Solution With the help of Mike Huwyler and Joe Kressler, the Digital Lab team helped build two apps/tools: A data transformation process flow that would take one “golden company code” and apply the same configuration for the remaining 121 company codes in each of the 52 tabs in the SLAN Excel template. A process automation (bot) that took individual pieces of configuration data from the SLAN Development environment and applied it into the SLAN Excel template for the next environment (Test or Production) The Win By using data analysis and automation on this engagement, the following benefits were realized: Time saved. The data transformation process flow ran in under five minutes for an activity that would have taken a human 16 hours; not only on time, but every time a configuration update was required by the client. The automation program ran in under 10 minutes for an activity that would have taken a day or more to do at least 4x (1x for each environment). Overall saving 160+ man-hours. Accuracy. By using process automation, the project team avoided any human error that would have resulted in 60+ hours of error resolution and correction. Re-use. These applications can be reused on other Nakisa projects in the future.

Since our business is strong, we’ve increased the bonus pools for this year by 10%, giving leaders a larger pool of resources to recognize individual contributions. The 10% uplift doesn’t mean individual bonuses will necessarily increase by 10%. It means that during Career Roundtables, as our leaders invest in understanding your individual performance and impact, they will have a larger pool of resources to reward differentiated performance. Your relationship leader will discuss this during your Career Outlook discussion.

When it comes to traveling -- by car, train or plane -- it can be stressful. Frequent travel can lead to a poor diet and lack of exercise, while the side effects of jet lag can include mood changes, disturbed sleep and daytime fatigue, all of which can affect job performance. Here are tips to help manage your energy while traveling. Start your trip as well rested as possible. If you are over-tired, stressed, or under the weather before the flight, chances are good that jet lag will catch up with you. Always pack “hangry” snacks. Stock up on healthy snacks such as fruit, protein bars or trail mix, so if your flight is delayed or you’re sitting on the tarmac, you can refuel. See our nutrition guide for healthy snacking tips. Stay hydrated during the flight by choosing water (vs. soda, caffeine or alcohol). This combats the dry cabin air that can cause headaches and dry out the eyes and nasal passages -- the ideal conditions for catching colds or other viruses. Do some simple stretches in your seat to keep circulation moving. Instead of working the entire time on the plane or train, work in 90-minute sprints. Then recover mentally for 20-30 minutes by reading a favorite book, flipping through a magazine or practicing mindfulness. When you’re away from home, exercise for at least 20 minutes in the morning. If you don’t do it then, you probably won’t get to it. If there’s no gym in the hotel or nearby, no stairs to walk or run, and you can’t go outside, simply do some exercises in the room: yoga poses, push-ups, sit-ups, squats, lunges or jumping jacks. Try to eat the same healthy foods you eat at home. And if you travel frequently, you can’t think of eating on the road as “treating” yourself -- because it’s your normal routine. Read Fuel your body with the right stuff. Commit to your desired sleep routine. If you normally go to sleep at 11 p.m., don’t stay out past 11 or work through the evening until 11 just because you’re away from home. Try to do things that are as close to your normal or desired habits as possible. Bring along ear plugs or download a white noise app – such as White Noise Lite – from PwC’s App Store to block out noise, call a loved one, practice that hobby or explore the local area. During your meetings, make sure you take short, intentional breaks, even if it’s just to take three deep breaths or do some simple stretches in your chair. If you can get up, take a walk or get a nutritious snack. The key is to take regular breaks and use them to energize you. You can prioritize your well-being even while traveling -- better yet, try it with your teams and let us know how it’s going. Keep an eye out for additional resources.

Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. The Tax Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains links to the templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a Privacy Notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period, provides any tax service to a person in a FROR at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a FROR in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract.

The Checklist will still be available as a reference tool for clients and PwC teams to assess if the client has engaged in a reportable transaction. It can be found at the following LINK. Upon request from a client, engagement teams can provide a copy of the Checklist to assist clients. External reporting requirements for both clients and PwC have not changed. Clients must disclose their participation in any reportable transaction and PwC must register any reportable transaction when PwC is a Material Advisor. As part of preparing a tax return, you still must advise your client regarding their responsibilities around reportable transactions.

Quality is foundational to all that we want to accomplish in our strategy, and it enables us to drive our Your Tomorrow agenda forward. In FY20, we’re focused on bringing business-led and citizen-led innovation to life through our continued efforts to tech-enable our services and leverage our new digital skills on our own teams. And as we progress on this journey, it’s important that we are leading differently and engaging everyone on a deeper level. To do this effectively, we will be holding webcasts to outline our strategic priorities and explain your role in accelerating our future in the months ahead. If you’re in Core Assurance, you’ll also experience Your Tomorrow Live! events across the country this summer, which are designed to show you how our audit engagements will be different moving forward. And if you’re in our Specialty Assurance Businesses, you’ll hear more in the coming months on how Your Tomorrow is enabling digital upskilling and the client experience for both audit and non-audit accounts. You’ll receive calendar invites from your respective leaders soon. The months ahead are full of exciting opportunities that I hope will make you feel energized about our journey and confident about where we’re heading as a practice, whether you’re serving our audit or non-audit clients. Thanks for everything that you do. Quality is foundational to all that we want to accomplish in our strategy. Here are some helpful resources to continue to enhance quality on your engagements: Questions about your annual training requirements? Our 2019 mandated curriculum for Core Attest, Risk Assurance and PCS is now available. ICYMI: The latest policy, guidance and audit guides to help you prepare for 2019 audits. Plus, check out Inform for more on adoption of ASC 326, credit losses, and the PCAOB’s staff guidance to support implementation of CAM reporting. Our ASM&amp;T Q1 webcast was mandatory for certain groups. Be on the lookout for the CPE eligible replay version in April. The deadline for completion of this mandatory training is May 31. All Risk Assurance professionals who support Core Attest engagements are required to attend the ASM&amp;T Quality webcast for Risk Assurance Professionals Supporting Financial Statement/Integrated Audit Engagements on June 18. For those serving non-audit clients: Is your work related to Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR)? It’s not always obvious. To know for sure, you must examine the proposed scope, the entity for which the services would be provided, and the client’s controls environment. These services could be considered audit, non-audit, or both, impacting which engagement letter to use, required approvals (e.g., PCAOB Rule 3525), and how the services should be documented. Our 2017 PCAOB inspection report was released on March 28. Risk Assurance launched new risk messaging in the marketplace and updated its go-to-market strategy to drive pipeline. Click here to learn more. These GEPs are taking new roles in Assurance. As we communicated in December 2018, the PwC global network will move to five consistent staff levels across all territories and lines of service, effective July 1, 2019. If you have any questions, please refer to the Assurance FAQs. Revenue results in Assurance are close to budget through March. Specific to our business units, Transaction Services (CMAAS and Valuations) are above budget, while Core, PCS and Risk Assurance are ahead of prior year results but behind budget through March. FY20 annual pricing is now available in EMT for Assurance. Several other important improvements went live in early March. Refer here for details. We are now offering a centralized billing and collections process to help streamline the work you do around billing and collecting. You can find additional details on the B&amp;C Spark Page including a replay of our training session. Our non-audit practices, including Risk Assurance, TS and FS BAS will move to Flex Forecast this summer. Stay tuned for training and rollout details coming soon. Effective March 1 2019, we updated our primary credential policy. Are you involved in selling new work? Be sure you’re using Rapid Engage, which will streamline the client and engagement setup process. Access the tool here, and learn all about it here. At our recent xLoS partner meeting, Tim Ryan asked all of our partners to sit down individually with their teams to talk about how we can bring our Your Tomorrow skills and tools to life in order to enhance quality and efficiency on our engagements. If you haven’t heard about your team’s Your Tomorrow execution plan yet, ask your partner. Here’s an update on our progress with citizen-led innovation: We asked engagement teams to identify and track repetitive activities during busy season that could be automated to further enable quality and improve efficiency using new technologies. To date, we’ve received roughly 3,000+ ideas for automation! Here’s how you can help bring those ideas to life. Risk Assurance has also been sourcing ideas to bring Your Tomorrow to life -- they’ve gathered 500 submissions via Idea Lab Challenges and citizen-led launch packs. Are you on track to help us meet our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal and earn your Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30?

It’s full speed ahead as staff continue to focus on their digital upskilling in 2019, and across the firm we’re seeing our people bring their digital acumen to life. But getting started with new and emerging digital technologies can feel overwhelming. You probably have many questions. How are we going to do this? When is the right time to get started? Who will help lead the effort? How will this impact our client work? The Digital Accelerators (DAs) in the Private Company Services (PCS) group had an idea for helping PCS Tax partners and staff get familiar with digital tools and technology and, more importantly, how to use them on client engagements. In order to successfully implement digital tools, the PCS Tax DAs wanted to take a step back, look at the processes being used, and evaluate where technology could automate those processes and improve how engagement teams worked. To achieve this goal, DAs in PCS Tax started conducting process improvement (Pi) sessions in October with each PCS Tax partner and their engagement teams. By the end of the year, they conducted Pi sessions in 45 cities and assisted more than 90 PCS engagement teams. With this personalized approach, the DAs helped teams look for pain points and identify digital solutions — demonstrating where technology could help, seeing if solutions existed in Digital Lab, or identifying where an Alteryx workflow or Bot could solve problems. “Going through the processes and thinking of different or better ways to get the work done has helped teams to identify some ‘quick-wins’ from Digital Lab and break down the barrier to getting started,” said PCS Tax DA Mark Krzeczowski. The Pi sessions helped drive excitement and energy in the markets. “It’s not often that you get the entire engagement team (including the partner) to sit down and talk through the current process of an engagement,” said PCS Tax DA Ryan McConaghy, “These open dialogue discussions helped teams identify areas for time savings by just rethinking how we approach the engagement.” The response to the Pi sessions has been extremely positive as teams have been able to get a better feel for technology and the benefits of using it on engagements. PCS Tax partner, Marissa Nelson commented, “The process improvement session we had helped me and my team identify where the inefficiencies in our processes were and align technology solutions with those processes to help significantly reduce time spent.” Find out more about the PCS Tax Digital Accelerator Team and what they’re up to on their Google site.

Tim Ryan talks audit, consulting mix and Need a business acumen boost? Tim Ryan talks audit, consulting mix and more on Bloomberg HQ News March 12, 2019 We see change all around us — at work, at home and at our clients. In this environment, our clients want to know our view on where industries are going, how fast technology is moving and what they should be doing to respond. Tim Ryan shared his view on some of these issues in two recent interviews with Bloomberg. Recently, Tim talked about the findings from PwC’s CEO Survey on Bloomberg with David Westin. While CEOs are cautious about the economy, they are optimistic about investing in their own businesses and in the future of how they will work. Digitization, AI and robotics are just some of the ways companies are dealing with the economic uncertainty. Our own upskilling journey is an example of how we’re also responding to the forces of change — and sharing our experiences is a good starting point for client conversations. Tim also spoke to Bloomberg Tax about PwC’s future — and that of the profession. As you may have seen in the headlines, the audit industry has recently been under scrutiny in the UK. While we are not hearing a lot of questions in the US, we all should be prepared to speak to the role audit firms play in the marketplace. With our One Firm approach, many of us contribute more broadly to the quality the firm delivers — we should be ready to tell our story proudly and be prepared to explain the value of our multidisciplinary approach.

Consider a wellness checku Want to jump start your well-being journey? Consider a wellness checkup National Benefits Feb. 11, 2019 Regular health exams are important. Even if you feel fine, the tests, screenings and discussions you have with your doctor can help detect problems early -- and could identify potential issues -- so you can take steps to prevent a serious health condition before it starts. If you’re enrolled in the PwC UnitedHealthcare (UHC) medical plan, you may choose to have your personal physician or EHE perform your preventive physical examination. Preventive exams performed by EHE or by an in-network doctor are 100% covered by the UHC medical plans through UHC.* If you’re not enrolled in a PwC medical plan, your medical care coverage likely includes a preventive exam (your out-of-pocket cost will depend on the provisions of the plan you are covered by). Using EHE for your preventive exam EHE is a premier physical exam provider that provides one-stop preventive care. When you use EHE, your examination will include a wide range of screening tests tailored to your age, gender, family history, risk factors and other individual needs. There are no claim forms, deductibles, copays or coinsurance. Ongoing support from EHE health mentors -- Plus, you’ll receive 12 months of personal health coaching, where you’ll have access to health mentors who work with you to build a personalized action plan for year-round well-being. To learn how EHE benefited PwC Talent Acquisition Leader, Dustin Bartolomeo-Damon, read his story here. Who is eligible for EHE and how can you schedule an appointment? If enrolled in the PwC UHC plan on the date of your exam, you and your spouse/domestic partner may take advantage of EHE. Individuals who are at least age 30 may visit EHE once per plan year at no cost (10 months must elapse between EHE exams) while those under age 30 may take advantage of the no-cost visit once every three years. Schedule your EHE appointment by calling (800) 362-8671; professional resource directors are available Monday-Friday, from 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Or schedule your appointment online at www.eheandme.com. If eligible to participate in a PwC UHC medical plan option but not enrolled, you and your spouse/DP may still utilize EHE. However, you must pay the full cost of the exam at the time of your visit and submit a claim to your health carrier for a level of reimbursement. For more details about EHE for staff, click here. Get $50 from the Well-Being Rewards Program for completing your exam The Well-Being Rewards Program provides an added incentive -- you can earn $50 per plan year just by undergoing a preventive exam. Remember, you’ll need to enter your exam details in the Virgin Pulse site via your desktop in order to claim your $50. * Note: Charges for care and services prescribed beyond the scope of eligible preventive care will be subject to your medical plan’s cost-sharing provisions.

Get to know our new One Firm campaign Marketing &amp; Sales March 1, 2019 Not since the first Industrial Revolution have we seen emerging technology so profoundly impact every aspect of our lives. From the Internet of Things (IoT), to process automation, to robotics, the convergence of human capability and digital potential continues to create new opportunities, as well as challenges. To help our clients prepare for these market forces, we launched an integrated, One Firm campaign this week around this Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), designed to help organizations rise above uncertainty and be prepared to become #4IReady. We are well positioned to help clients put the right strategy in place, harness human-insight experience, identify the right technology, and foster a workforce culture that’s focused on growth and adoption. The topic was front and center at the World Economic Forum in Davos a few weeks ago, and took center stage this week in Barcelona as part of our presence at Mobile World Congress, the world’s largest mobile event. This is a huge opportunity to bring our One Firm resources to help our clients, in appropriate ways, deal with the implications and opportunities arising from all the changes happening around them and confidently move forward. It’s also an opportunity to demonstrate our leadership in digital transformation. In addition to our #4IReady web presence, social media, press, videos and bylines, the campaign will feature content in Bloomberg and Quartz throughout the spring. How you can help spread the word There are important — and different — benefits for bringing our 4IR capabilities to our audit and non-audit clients. For audit clients, the focus will be on education and driving awareness of this seismic shift in how we live and work (and even play). It also ushers in a revolution of experience. And in the non-audit context, 4IR will help us empower leading organizations to intelligently apply technology to solve important business challenges. It’ll drive innovation and new business opportunities, while decreasing costs and increasing efficiencies and productivity to rise above current market volatility and predicted economic downturn. Get up to speed with the resources below and talk to your leaders about the best way to bring insights to the clients you serve. Read our point of view on our new 4IR webpage. For clients outside the US, there will also be a landing page on the Global PwC website. Discuss our PoV with your clients and see what issues we may be able to help them solve. Our Integrated Solutions address many of the challenges they will incur. Learn how our platforms, lines of service and sectors align to assist our non-audit client base. This is a One Firm approach, bringing capabilities from across the firm to address issues in a differentiated way for our non-audit clients. Learn more about how our platforms align with helping our clients respond to 4IR.

What we’re hearing from our leaders in Barcelona “It is just amazing to be here this year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona witnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution in play. Massive innovation -- companies from the telecommunications world, banking, financial services and automotive sectors are all here trying to understand what it means to be ready for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. How they need to innovate, not only on the product side but also innovate on the business model side.” - Mohamed Kande, Vice Chairman and US Advisory Leader (check out his video on Twitter @PwCUS) “It’s still very early to talk about the policy decisions that may be made around the 4IR, but we believe it’s important for businesses to take a do-it-yourself approach and begin to establish some boundaries for how to innovate responsibly.” - David Sapin, Risk &amp; Regulatory Platform Leader Questions?

As we approach 12/31 year ends, the TEA team has compiled a TEAm Readiness Checklist that provides general and solution specific (i.e., FSLI) tips on working with CoEs. This checklist includes steps teams should consider when working with CoEs to continue enhancing quality and simplifying and standardizing activities for efficiency, when appropriate. If you’re not using a CoE for the upcoming cycle, make sure you read this document to prepare for 2019. And even if you are, we encourage you to take a look as you might find the information helpful. The guidance focuses on key areas, including: General COE Participation Tips These helpful tips are not specific to any particular CoE but best practices for our engagements and for working effectively with a CoE. Launch Documents Launch Documents highlight the scope of the CoE’s testing for the 2018 audit cycle, in addition to other key information. These are live documents that will be updated for 2019 as the scope of work for each CoE evolves over time. Solution Tips Helpful tips have been accumulated for the 11 Solutions based on proof of concept and pilots executed over the course of the past 18 months. It is important to be aware of these tips for your future experience with a CoE. Note that some of these are required for participation in a particular CoE.

It actually happened in real life -- and to two of our own. Partner Chad Leopard, based in Dallas, and Manager Matt Hill, based in Washington, DC, both chose to spend the week of the firm shutdown in Haiti. Each traveled with their respective churches as volunteers for Mission of Hope, a group dedicated to supporting Haitians in the areas of health, infrastructure and spirituality. The two men did not know each other at the start of the trip; by happenstance, they met toward the end of the week in a way neither will forget. Political unrest in Haiti The week went as planned and was rewarding and productive for both men and their respective mission groups. They relished the chance to make a difference in the Haitian community by improving living conditions and providing guidance to Haitian youth to help the local churches better meet the needs of the villagers. But on Friday they learned of protests and demonstrations in Port-au-Prince, an hour and a half from where the Mission of Hope volunteers were staying. The cause: a dramatic spike in fuel taxes. “The Haitian government subsidizes fuel prices,” Chad explained, “so when these subsidies were lifted it prompted skyrocketing prices, making it unsustainable for the low-income inhabitants in this already cash-strapped nation.” While the increases were quickly suspended, it was too late to subdue the civil unrest that had already ensued. “It was intense,” said Matt. “We heard about barricades, looting and protestors blocking the streets.” “Mission of Hope assured everyone that we were safe inside the fully guarded compound, but it soon became clear that evacuation would be needed,” said Chad. Instant friends While waiting to evacuate, conversations among the group became the wellspring of critical connections. "During one such exchange, a woman from my group said that she just met another man from PwC on the trip,” said Chad. They became an instant team -- helping others as much as they could. "I also ran into the daughter and son of one of my best friends growing up in Alabama,” Chad said. “What are the odds? Their dad felt comforted that their kids knew someone else at the Mission at this time of crisis." The great escape: PwC to the rescue The plan was to leave for the airport at 4 a.m on Saturday. "But Mission of Hope couldn’t verify our safety in terms of whether the roads were clear of protestors or if the airport was even open,” said Matt. To help assist their respective groups, Matt and Chad began creating a contingency plan. “We called our airlines and US governmental officials for assistance,” said Chad. “And then I called my EA Glenda McDonald. She was actually at church at the time, but luckily answered her phone anyway.” Glenda contacted Partner Nikki Parham and Texas Market Managing Partner Scott Moore. “Scott contacted Director Tim Redding of PwC's Crisis Management and US Security team, who became the main contact for Matt and me,” said Chad. Tim provided a crisis team service representative at Amex travel to work on flight arrangements for both men. He also got in touch with US government officials in Haiti. In the midst of it all, Chad and Matt tried to help the rest of the volunteers in any way they could. The next big challenge was how to get to the airport safely. Armed guards, protestors, airport chaos They finally got the all-clear, and Chad’s group was the first to arrive at the airport in an armed bus caravan. The trip to the airport was stressful due to remnants of turmoil along the way, including road blockage, burned-out trucks and looters. “The airport was a total zoo; I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Chad. Amid the chaos, Chad had trouble getting his group through immigration and customs. PwC to the rescue once again. “Raquel from Amex worked her magic,” Chad said. “She got the airline to hold the flight until our group successfully checked in.” Chad was the last person to board the plane. “I held my breath until take off,” he said. “It was an overall harrowing and humbling experience.” Matt’s group made it out safely the next day. “With five minutes’ notice, we boarded a school bus to the airport, accompanied by armed guards, driving past protesters and barricades,” said Matt. Ultimately, all of the Mission of Hope volunteers and staff successfully evacuated Haiti. Home safely, thanks to teamwork Back on US soil, both men credit PwC for saving the day. “The response from the firm was instantaneous,” said Matt. “The help we received was very encouraging and comforting.” Chad agreed. “They were supportive and in touch with us constantly.” US Security’s Tim Redding said there were several ways his team helped. “We kept them aware of current news reports, shared solid intel and travel logistics, and reassured them that our government contacts in Haiti were ready to step in if necessary.” And when in doubt before, during or after a trip -- or for any reason -- feel free to call the PwC Emergency Hotline. “We provide consultation for any international trip, whether business or pleasure. We can tell you what to plan for and what to expect.” Chad and Matt agreed that being in constant contact with PwC really made a difference. We think Chad and Matt made a difference, too. They dedicated their week-long break to helping the Haitian community and then continued to help their fellow volunteers during a harrowing ordeal. ********************************************************************************************************************************************** To speak with a US Security team member, call the PwC Emergency Hotline at: 888-755-1515 (within the US) or 1-813-351-6460 (outside the US).

US Air Force uniform “We are IFS” focuses on inspiring stories from our IFS colleagues. Marie Reynaud, a senior associate based out of the Tampa office, can’t stop gushing about her love of the military. “It’s just in my blood,” she said. Her role as a recruiter on PwC’s Talent Acquisition team helps foster her devotion and involves representing the firm at local military organizations and US Air Force bases. “We love to recruit veterans and their spouses,” she said. “I’m proud to be with such a military-friendly firm.” Marie and her team are also dedicated to helping those with a military background transition to civilian careers. “When they join the firm, they need help learning the culture and typical office routines,” she said. “We help them do that -- and we also speak at local military events to spread the word that not only is PwC a great place to work, but a welcoming one for those coming from the military.” Recruiting for military veterans is a perfect match for Marie; she’s a veteran herself, having served in the Air Force for 20 years before coming to PwC in 2011. “The Air Force was my first job out of high school,” she said. “I served as a morse code operator, dental assistant, commander’s aid and photographer.” But it’s her last military role that stands out the most: She was the first female Air Force recruiter, a role she was in for 12 years. It’s no surprise she found her job at PwC while attending a recruiting event. “After serving three months as a contractor, I was hired as a full-time recruiting associate,” she said. “The firm appreciated my involvement with the military community and how that lifeline could support PwC’s goals of attracting veterans and their families.” It’s a family affair for Marie, too. “My husband Roy and I are ‘ambassadors’ for an organization of local military parents,” she explained. “My youngest son is in the Air Force; we like to give back.” Staying active in PwC’s Veterans Affinity Network (VAN) is another way Marie gives back. “We donate stocking stuffers to the military community at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa during the holidays and collect back-to-school supplies for their dependent children and care packages for the local troops, in addition to volunteering at local military career fairs,” she said. At VAN meetings, and on Veterans Day, Marie can be seen proudly wearing her uniform as she hands out flags and lunch tickets to our PwC vets. “My original uniform still fits!” Marie’s dedication extends beyond the military; she enjoys participating in the Reading Pals program through PwC’s Access Your Potential®, too. “I volunteer once a week,” she said. “Some of the kids couldn’t read when I first met them. There’s nothing better than seeing their faces light up the first time they finish a chapter on their own. It’s very rewarding.” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

The WEF and participants support international collaboration as a way of solving critical global challenges, with this year’s gathering focused on “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World.” Business leaders held strategy sessions on the hottest topics on the minds of CEOs today, from preparing the workforce for the jobs of the future to planning for risks like cybersecurity threats. Tim Ryan was on the ground to represent PwC US as our 21st annual Global CEO Survey was released. Watch this video for his three takeaways from the week, and read on below for a peek at his calendar, photos from a busy week in the Swiss Alps and insights you can share with your clients and network. On Monday, PwC launched its Annual Global CEO Survey. Tim Ryan, Global Chairman Bob Moritz and UK Chairman Kevin Ellis presented the results to World Economic Forum attendees in Davos. CEOs are the most optimistic they’ve been about the global economy since the 2008 recession. Here’s where you can access global survey findings:www.pwc.com/ceosurvey (download the PDF or Digital version) On Wednesday, PwC hosted a cocktail and dinner reception, where our leaders discussed the results of our CEO Survey with our clients and guests. You can be part of the conversation, too. Our 2018 Executive Dialogues Deck and talking points present US findings in an executive-level supplement that is easy to customize for meetings. (Visit our US CEO Survey on Spark for more resources.) Tim spoke on a Wall Street Journal Panel, “Business Over Bias” Tim spoke alongside business leaders from Procter &amp; Gamble and Microsoft about how to identify the sources of bias and prevent it. Tim found time to share his thoughts in 2 blog pieces Tim covers some of the key topics that came up at Davos -- and advocates for US organizations to invest in people and digital, backing his call with findings from the 21st CEO Survey. He also wrote about US infrastructure improvements on the WEF Blog. It was a busy week for our leaders at Davos. The only thing that could top the incredible discussions they had is this view.

But stepping away from the screen to prioritize well-being is a habit they’ve been implementing for quite some time. Two years ago, senior associate Kate Baron started an office kickball team and joined a local league. The idea was met with enthusiasm by her colleagues. “Everyone was excited to network outside the office while engaging in a healthy activity,” said Kate. “We were quickly able to create a One Firm team of 20 people with varying skill levels. Even some of our clients joined.” After one season, the team took a lengthy hiatus. But last year, Lindsey Haynes was inspired by Be well, work well to reunite the team. Despite a less-than-stellar record, the team had such a great time they continued to play and even ventured into dodgeball and flag football. They set up practice sessions on the weekends to prepare for games. “We may be in the midst of a losing streak,” Kate joked. “But it’s all about the bonding experience. Being able to disengage from work and connect with colleagues has made a noticeable difference in everyone's energy.” In addition to playing sports to boost energy, the team engages in various Digital Upskilling challenges, like PowerUp! and Learn2earn. “We’re a competitive bunch,” Lindsey admitted. “Everyone wants to win PowerUp! Some of our teammates have already completed the first two Digital Quests and leveraged bots in Digital Lab for the Learn2earn challenge.” Follow the Seattle Super Stars on Instagram to see how they keep up their well-being habits and Digital Upskilling. We hope their story inspires you to embody our Your Tomorrow strategy. Do you have a Be well, work well or Digital Upskilling story to share? Let us know!

As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The time is always right to do what is right.” Because you asked how PwC could do the right thing and be a leader, we’ve taken action to make our firm and communities places where we all feel a sense of belonging. And we’ve seen that when we ask others to join us, the impact is even greater. Last month, more than 150 companies followed our example and held Day of Understanding discussions about race and inclusion -- and the number of calls, texts and emails I’ve received from CEOs thanking us for our leadership has been inspiring. We also launched an amazing tech-enabled bus that is traveling the country and raising awareness of unconscious bias. And inside PwC, more than 15,000 of our directors and managers took part in training last month to help them be more inclusive leaders. These are great examples of what it means to be purpose-led and values-driven -- but while we can feel proud, we won’t stop trying to get better. As we observe Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, it’s a good time to think about how we continue to take steps that make a difference and inspire others to join us. As individuals, we can do something right now by taking the I Act On pledge. This effort, led by CEO Action for Diversity and InclusionTM, encourages individuals to pledge to check their unconscious biases, speak up for others and show up for all. We can also put our commitment into action by learning more through ourOutsmarting Human Minds podcast, getting involved in our Inclusion Networks with PwC, or continuing to have open conversations with others around us. You have my commitment that we’ll continue to work hard as a firm to become even more inclusive. Following up on the sessions for our managers and directors, we’ll continue the conversation around inclusive leadership with the rest of our team in the months ahead. Whether we’re talking to our client or our friends, we can also share with pride what our firm is doing and how we’re making a difference and driving real change in society. Even if our clients are not part of CEO Action, they can benefit from the ideas and resources of the CEO Action site and take part in the I Act On pledge. Thank you for doing what is right and making a positive impact with our colleagues and our communities as you go about your work. I’m proud of this team and how we bring our values and those of Dr. King to life each day.

As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers/directors, and IFS directors with five or more years of service, are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to unwind, recharge and truly focus on their well-being through Be well, work well -- a key component of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Sometimes it’s the simplest things in life that are the best. Just ask senior manager Robyn Hunter, who recently took a sabbatical that was the opposite of radical. Instead, it was a simple and rewarding experience. “Ever since I became a working mother six years ago, I never had an extended period of uninterrupted time with my family,” Robyn reflected. “I was constantly multitasking between work and home. A staycation sabbatical was an opportunity to be fully immersed in my personal life.” Robyn intentionally chose to take her sabbatical at home. Spending quality time with her husband and children allowed her to make the most of the experience. Most importantly, Robyn was able to renew her energy. “My mental state significantly improved during the sabbatical,” she explained. “I was able to focus on one thing at a time and learned the valuable lesson that multitasking truly is a myth.” The time off had an impact on her family, as well. “Toward the end of my sabbatical I realized the positive impact it had on my mental state,” she said. “My interactions with family members were so much better. I was living in the moment. They noticed the difference, and it meant something to me.” Robyn has advice for those planning a sabbatical -- regardless of what they decide to do with the time: “I selected a quieter time in our fiscal year (August). Communicate your plans with your clients and team, and make sure everyone is comfortable and aware of expectations. That will also reduce the likelihood that they'll need to contact you when you're away.” Visit our Rewards Strategy site to read more about sabbaticals and learn about PwC's Career Milestone program.

Here’s how some PwCers are making a difference with Digital Lab From binders to bots: As members of the Quantitative Solutions &amp; Technologies group, Managing Director Tyler Whately and Manager Jarrod Mead are delivering national trainings to support the adoption of workflow and visualization tools by staff and clients. Despite their traditional tax accounting backgrounds, they recognize that how they look at and analyze data has significantly changed. “When I started with the firm in 2013, we were still using paper binders,” said Jarrod. “That wasn’t that long ago. Today, I’m helping clients see the value of using workflows, visualizations and bots in engagements.” They’re encouraging peers to learn the latest technologies by demonstrating bots can save time. “We take them through something that they traditionally do through our T&amp;E system and show how using a bot can improve the process,” said Tyler. “It’s all about demystifying the technology and helping others to see the possibilities.” Automating Workday reporting: Over her 18 years with the firm, Tracy Vinson has recognized &amp; helped teams improve countless processes. Our teams have always wanted to make things better -- they just didn't always have the skills to make it happen on their own. With Your Tomorrow and digital upskilling, that is changing”; “now everyone can do this and feel confident about it.” Just recently, when her Talent partner expressed a pain point for our Talent consultants -- who regularly had to pull four separate Workday reports and manually copy information from each -- Tracy took the time to interview the team about the issue, goal, best case solution and end goal, created the ‘Workday HC Reporting - Enhancing &amp; Managing Worker Detail’ solution and brought it back for testing and refinement and finally uploaded it to Digital Lab. “The solution is targeted to our 400+ Talent consultants, so it hasn’t been downloaded too much, but everybody has a different need. That is what is great about Digital Lab -- you can look at numerous solutions (even if outside your area), learn from them and customize them for your needs.” Tracy’s advice? “There is so much opportunity for everyone now to upskill. Outside of Digital Accelerators, you can access self-service options. Don't wait for someone to train you, empower yourself!” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/35636.html</url><pwc_title>7 tools to help you prepare for a more efficient busy season</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:41:45</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:Assurance|source:Assurance</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-12-06 10:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:Assurance</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>7 tools to help you prepare for a more efficient busy season 7 tools to help you prepare for a more efficient busy season Assurance Dec. 6, 2018 Year-end is almost here.

See the signs Your eyes are always changing (more than you notice) and they might be under more strain now — especially during our busiest times. Plus, health problems like diabetes or high blood pressure can show signs through your eyes — signs an eye exam may help you spot.* Put your PwC benefits to work If you’re enrolled in PwC’s Vision Care Plan, consider scheduling an exam. You’re eligible for one each plan year (July 1-June 30). Pick an eye doctor with the location and hours that work for you. You’ll pay a $10 exam copay when you visit a network provider. If you use an out-of-network provider, you’ll pay 100% and EyeMed will reimburse you up to $35 toward the cost of care.** If you need glasses or contacts, your cost ranges based upon your needs and the options you choose. Remember, you’ll experience the greatest cost savings when you use in-network providers. If you’re not currently enrolled in the Vision Care Plan, you will have an opportunity to elect coverage during this year’s Annual Enrollment period, May 1-15, for coverage effective July 1. Earn Well-Being Rewards points The Well-Being Rewards Program provides an added incentive for having your routine eye exam.

Phoenix, our new One Firm, cloud-based, tech-enabled workflow platform will eventually connect you more seamlessly to our service delivery teams -- like our Service Delivery Centers and Centers of Excellence and even digital labor (e.g., robotics) in the future. That means you can spend less time managing the workflow and more time delivering enhanced quality and more value to our clients, from the office or on the go. In July, select US engagement teams began piloting the first version of Phoenix -- the basic version of the platform that will be enhanced and further developed throughout FY19. We’ll add more teams and features to further standardize and digitize the global delivery experience. Here are a few enhancements to look for: Making Phoenix mobile-ready Automating resource assignment (for delivery teams) Building in issue-escalation capabilities Making it easier to provide feedback Enhancing the dashboards and reporting capabilities to be more like a virtual PMO We will also further streamline the experience by integrating with LoS tools like Aura, Tax Engagement Center and DMS. These changes will also provide better transparency into the status of work. Finally, as part of our continuous improvement and simplification promises to you, we will sunset our legacy Envoy system next summer. If you’re part of the first Phoenix pilot, you already should have heard from us and received training. If you’re not part of the first wave, stay tuned for updates in PwC Inside.

In addition to the Leadership Development Experience/CRT reminders shared earlier this week, here are additional considerations for Tax to help you make the most of this time to review your progress and talk about your career goals: Preparing for your mid-year coaching conversation Mid-year coaching conversations are an opportunity to step back with your Development Team and reflect on your progress against the PwC Professional framework, development needs and impact so far this performance year. Capture your impact and cover 80% of your hours in Snapshots. Be thoughtful in the “Please describe your role in the work included in this Snapshot” field -- this is a great place to highlight your specific impact -- especially hours saved from your P5M contributions and other digitization efforts. (Here’s additional guidance and examples for this part of your Snapshots.) If this is a potential promotion year for you, discuss your progress toward and plan for completing the promotion requirements, including Blindspot training, Tax Foundation Milestones, credentialing and Quality &amp; Risk Management courses. Looking ahead to year-end Career Roundtable discussions, what factors into compensation, promotion and tier decisions? While mid-year coaching conversations are more informal, it’s not too soon to think about actions you can take to influence Career Roundtables. As our Tax strategy and expectations have evolved, what impact looks like has also evolved.

Before you read about the what, I want to remind you of the why. Our clients are telling us they want more value, a digital experience and a lower cost. All of you want to be part of a firm with great opportunities to grow and make a difference -- and we're responding! Each of these changes has a digital element and moves us closer to being a truly tech-enabled firm. Because these changes reduce manual work, we’ll have more time to spend in ways that add value -- focusing on our clients, coaching each other, or caring for ourselves, families or friends. Plus, when we're more efficient, we can invest in our business and all of you through Your Tomorrow. So my ask for you is simple: Use these new platforms and tools. We’re not only creating a better experience for you, we’re also taking steps that add up to a firm that is relevant, ready for the future -- and a great place for you Risk-related issues? The One Firm Risk Organization is here to help What’s in it for you: An easier, faster, One Firm way to navigate risk-related decisions and move to market. The scoop: Need help with client acceptance, risk management, contracting or Independence issues? Our new One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) can help. OFRO specialists are organized by service offering (not LoS or business unit), which means your first point of contact will bring in the right subject matter specialists to address your issue. No more navigating multiple groups! Plus, the new OFRO portal offers a wealth of resources on risk-related matters, and new tools like Rapid Engage, Create and DocuSign (read on!) further simplify the client and engagement startup process. Easy as pie: Rapid Engage delivers engagement startup faster and easier What’s in it for you: Go from opportunity identification to WBS code release faster. The scoop: Do you spend a lot of time getting engagements set up and codes opened? Help is on the way! Rapid Engage is a desktop and mobile tool that provides a transparent, dashboard overview of the process and streamlines startup for US engagements. (Think of those “pizza trackers” that allow customers to watch their pizza status as it moves from order, to oven, and out for delivery.) The tool overlays our existing client and engagement acceptance systems (including A&amp;C, AFS, engagement contracts, myEngage and others), providing one interface that helps you complete required process steps and track your progress. Rapid Engage will roll out in a phased approach throughout August; look for more information from your line of service. Watch a preview video. Having two work phone numbers is so FY18. Welcome to Mobile Only What’s in it for you: Just one phone number, one voicemail to manage and one point of contact for your clients and colleagues. The scoop: We’re on our way to becoming a Mobile Only workplace -- that means retiring individual office “landline” phone numbers in favor of mobile phones, and significantly reducing phones in all offices. Whether you're in the office or on the move, you’ll simply use your mobile phone, Google Meet or WebEx to connect and collaborate. We’ll still have speakerphones in enclosed spaces like offices and conference rooms. Become an early adopter by voluntarily retiring your number now; the office-by-office rollout will start this November and conclude in March 2020. Here’s how. Phoenix takes flight: An easier way to work with our Service Delivery Centers What’s in it for you: An easier, more efficient way to work with our service delivery teams. And goodbye, Envoy! The scoop: In July the first teams began using the initial version of Phoenix, our new workflow platform to request, receive and manage services from service delivery teams (e.g., SDCs and CoEs, and in the future third parties and digital). Phoenix digitizes interactions with our delivery teams, standardizes processes, and eventually will streamline the experience by integrating with Google and existing LoS tools like Aura, Engagement Center and DMS. Throughout FY19 we’ll add more teams and enhance functionality, retiring Envoy at the end of FY19. But wait … there’s more! 2 tools to simplify your (contracting) life No more collecting ink signatures and manually drafting engagement letters. Get digital with DocuSign and Create, available now to simplify your workday and give your clients a better experience.

If so, have you considered whet Do you work on multinational clients? If so, have you considered whether the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC) 6 affects them? One Firm Risk Organization April 25, 2019 Working with multinational clients can present some unique risks, as there is a need to understand how non-US laws may influence projects you undertake with your client. Understanding the DAC6 reporting requirements, effectively communicating those requirements to your clients, and considering the costs associated with compliance when formulating engagement budgets, can avert engagement surprises and dissatisfied clients. What is DAC6? In brief, it's a new directive adopted by the European Union (EU) that requires reporting of certain cross-border arrangements if the arrangement affects at least one entity in an EU Member State and is determined to include one or more defined “hallmarks”, which are broadly defined characteristics identified as potentially indicating aggressive tax planning. (Hallmarks) Reporting of such cross-border arrangements will apply to arrangements after June 25, 2018. However, reporting is not expected until July of 2020. The goal of DAC6 is to provide tax authorities of Member States with more information on tax planning transactions so the tax authorities in the Member States can assess whether such transactions facilitate tax evasion or avoidance. In general, the mandatory reporting requirements apply to “Intermediaries,” which are defined broadly to include tax advisors, accountants, lawyers, banks, financial advisors, etc. who design or market reportable cross-border tax-planning arrangements with an EU cross-border element for their clients. Those who provide assistance and advice on the tax aspects of such arrangements may also be considered Intermediaries. Where no Intermediary exists or has a reporting obligation, the obligation to make the required disclosure falls to the taxpayer. While we generally do not believe the US firm will be an Intermediary under DAC6, if you work with a PwC network member firm located in the EU, the PwC network member may be an Intermediary for reporting purposes. This means they’ll look to you for information regarding the mandatory reporting. If there is no Intermediary, your client will look to you to provide insight and assistance in meeting its reporting obligation. Begin the DAC6 dialog Make sure you know the basics of DAC6 so you can effectively communicate them to your client and retain the appropriate documentation to support any reporting requirement. For more information on this emerging reporting requirement, see the DAC6 talking points (internal only). You can also watch this short video: DAC6 in 90 seconds- Key elements of the new EU cross-border tax directive and share it with your clients. Still have questions on DAC6?

Through their soup kitchen, food pantry and various programs catered for senior citizens, Food Bank NYC provides more than 100,000 free meals each month and over 1.2 billion to date. On the morning of November 6th, half of our PwC volunteers worked together to chop fresh salads, cook pasta and meatballs, bake an apple dessert, and serve the nutritious lunch to over 200 senior citizens. The other volunteers had the opportunity to assist local residents, some with families of up to 8 people, shop through the Food Bank’s pantry ranging from fresh produce to meats, grains and more. One of our volunteers, Carlos Fidalgo, using his fluency in Spanish, was able to speak to over 50 families over the phone and deliver the news that they would be receiving a turkey for Thanksgiving. Carlos, in reflecting on this experience, shared,“It was incredibly fulfilling to help these local families in need. When being notified that they were receiving a turkey for Thanksgiving, people began to cheer and you could hear the sheer joy in their voices. These experiences make you truly appreciate the things we sometimes take for granted.” In this humbling experience, the PwC team was able to get to know the senior citizens community better and create a positive impact on society by helping those less fortunate. Moreover, our group of 25 individuals, grew their personal and professional network, strengthening the PwC brand in sharing this experience with one another. Chris Scarpati, Capital Markets Practice Leader, who has now championed this initiative for the past 2 years commented, “These events are always a great chance to give back to the community, help those who are less fortunate and be reminded to be thankful for all that we have. It’s been wonderful to see how this program has grown. Last year we started out with one session, this year we expanded it to two in order to help out more families and our PwC community responded, filling all those spots. I’m sincerely appreciative of the team's time and willingness to volunteer and am hopeful that we can continue this promising trend in the coming years.” The Food Bank team shared their gratitude for the time and enthusiasm that our volunteers were able to give that day noting that efforts like PwC’s are truly the “life-line of the Food Bank and help make their organization possible”. Showing you care about others, making a difference through your actions, and working together with diverse peoples are core pillars of PwC values that came to life at the NYC Food Bank. The team looks forward to its next rewarding volunteer experience! Interested in getting your PwC Team involved at the NYC Food Bank? Please contact John Giannotto for more information.

Between PowerUp!, Tech While You Trek, Learning Bursts, Digital Quests and more, 36,000+ of us have accessed at least one Digital Upskilling learning channel! This impressive statistic says we’re excited about investing in ourselves and building our digital skills — and that we’re well on our way to meeting our Your Tomorrow Digital Upskilling goal: all partners and staff earning the Digital Acumen knowledge badge by June 30, 2019. This is a credential that’s ours to keep and take with us, wherever our careers may lead. Digital Quests Everyone’s upskilling journey is personal and will proceed individually. There’s one requirement we all share, however: to complete the four Digital Quests. The first, the SquadFuel project, launched Nov. 6. Many of you have already completed it and have found it to be challenging, informative and rewarding. Haven’t gotten to the first Digital Quest yet? Here are three ways to prepare: Play PowerUp! Listen to Tech While You Trek in the Digital Hub Complete Learning Bursts Need inspiration? Meet these three learners who approach upskilling in different ways, and learn how they’re choosing their own digital adventures. You can also find learning resources on the “Digital Quest” page of the Digital Hub. What’s next? The second Digital Quest, The BankSure Project, will launch Dec. 20. There is no expectation that you complete the second Digital Quest during the firmwide shutdown. Please take that time to relax, unwind and recharge with friends and family so you can come back refreshed and ready to tackle the second Digital Quest in January. Look for the third and fourth Digital Quests by mid-March 2019. When you complete all four Digital Quests, you will earn the Digital Acumen knowledge badge. So, in the meantime, get in the game! Continue to build the critical digital skills that will help us work more efficiently and provide even better quality and value to our clients. The digital knowledge we’re all gaining will help us inside and outside of PwC, now and in the future.

Smart Pricing: Managers and up have been learning about, and applying, our Smart Pricing Strategy since the start of FY19, with deep-dive courses at TLC and TMC. And now, the strategy is being adopted on a One Firm basis. Smart Pricing is all about delivering outcomes that create value for our clients, through the intellectual capital of our people and the intellectual property of our technology and solutions at an appropriate price point. Want to learn more? Get aligned with our goals: As we pursue our goal of digitizing 5 million hours by spring 2020, we are also driving toward complementary Smart Pricing goals: increasing Realized Rate Per Hour by 10%+ in each of the next two years as a result of holding the line on price as we digitize our practice; and growing the percentage of Tax engagements with fixed-fee pricing structures or other Alternative Fee Arrangements to 70%. Fixed Fee Evolution Playbook: Review the playbook for guidance on your evolution to, and management of, fixed-fee pricing. Have you checked out Version 2 of the Smart Pricing Tool on FlexForecast? In addition to all the great features of Version 1, the tool now has several enhancements to help bring our new pricing strategy to our clients, including: Quantitative guidance on target realized rate-per-hour, a calculated target price, and a pricing dashboard for partners and MDs. Annual Performance Bonus Program As a reminder, our bonus pool uplift is tied to our financial performance against budget. At this time, we expect that bonuses will be paid out at the previously stated ranges. Any uplift to the pool will be dependent upon strong financial performance in the second half of the fiscal year. With busy season work just starting to pick up, we expect a positive trend in the coming months. Running our Business FY19 has been an exciting year as we continue to digitize and deliver strong results. A big thank you to all of you for staying focused on teaming, quality, value, delivering the Client Experience and supporting your teams -- even as we innovate and upskill to transform our business.

Where does your clie Cyber trailblazers are outperforming their peers. Where does your client stand? Advisory May 31, 2019 “Digital trailblazers” -- or organizations that take a business-driven cybersecurity approach to their digital initiatives -- are achieving better outcomes than their peers in digital initiatives and security overall. How can your client become one of them? Introduce them to PwC’s second Digital Trust Insights survey: Cyber trailblazers reframe security, driving business growth. This global study of over 3000+ respondents uncovered that digital trailblazers -- the top 25% of respondent organizations -- are: More proactive, preemptive and responsive than their peers, minimizing the operational impacts of cyber threats More likely to be credited with adding significant value to their organizations More optimistic about the potential for growth in revenue and profit margin More likely to embed their cybersecurity teams within the business to support strategic goals Trailblazers stand out in how they connect with the business: On strategy -- 65% of trailblazers strongly agree their cybersecurity team is embedded in the business, conversant in the organization’s business strategy and has a cybersecurity strategy that supports business imperatives (vs. 15% of others). On a risk-based approach -- 89% of trailblazers say their cybersecurity teams are consistently involved in managing the risks inherent in the organization’s business transformation or digital initiatives (vs. 41% of others). In execution -- 77% of trailblazers strongly agree their cybersecurity team has sufficient interaction with senior leaders to develop an understanding of the company’s risk appetite around core business practices (vs. 22% of others). The findings also explore who the trailblazers are -- looking across industries and regions to identify those who excel in aligning their business and cybersecurity strategies, take a risk-based approach, and coordinate among teams that monitor and manage risks. What you can take to your clients Clients have the opportunity to discover what sets trailblazers apart from the rest of the pack, and how to follow their example. Clients can also engage with the data through a series of interactive charts, filtering by region, industry, or company size. The findings can support client conversations around digital business trust. In addition, PwC’s Digital Trust Insights has a roadmap of where companies can focus attention on closing cybersecurity gaps.

Get resources to use in One Firm conversations and preview the findings below. This year’s report, titled “The Anxious Optimist in the Corner Office,” finds CEO sentiment to be at a post-recession high. A majority of US CEOs (52%) are “very confident” in revenue growth in 2018. That upturn in sentiment was building even before the overhaul to the US corporate tax system became law. Our findings are based on the views of nearly 1,300 CEOs in 85 countries (including more than 100 US CEOs), interviewed from Oct. 3 – Nov. 20, 2017.

The full report is available at www.pwc.com/usceosurvey. Driving growth in 2018: CEOs tell us they’ll work on many fronts to drive revenue and profitability this year. Most plan to strengthen the top line (79% global CEOs, 95% US CEOs). Acquisitions are also part of the growth playbook for more US CEOs this year (69%), far more than for their global peers (42%) and a significant jump from the 55% of US CEOs who were planning on new M&amp;A this time last year. Upskilling the workforce: US CEOs are in expansion mode, with 63% expecting headcount in their organization to increase this year. They’re also saying it’s more difficult to find qualified workers. CEOs are investing in continuous learning initiatives (39% US CEOs) to reduce employee churn and provide development paths for employees to add skills. The findings show that companies using robots and artificial intelligence to improve customer experience are more likely to invest in digital reskilling and development programs. Threats that are not abating in a faster-growth world: More US CEOs report high-level concern over cyberthreats (63%) and geopolitical uncertainty (50%) than last year. More US CEOs also believe we’re headed for a new round of global tax competition compared to their peers in priority international markets.

How we can help each other unplug -- and win a little ca Summer plans? How we can help each other unplug -- and win a little cash, too! Tim Ryan May 20, 2019 Team, I’m asking you to do something for yourself this week -- and that's to plan for a break! If you already have time off on your calendar -- thank you! When we take care of ourselves we’re better at work and in everything we do. There's another piece to my ask -- and that's to sit down with your team or put your plans on the agenda for your next catch up. Talk with your team about how you can protect the time so you can disconnect and recharge and then help your teammates do the same. I'm often asked to share my advice. One thing I've learned over the course of my career is that it's important to be disciplined about planning for and taking the time away. This is something I wish I had done better earlier in my career but I've learned! I have my time off blocked on my calendar this summer and I'm looking forward to it. With Be well, work well, we are committed to creating the culture and environment where we can take care of ourselves and manage our energy. And booking your time off is a key way to do that. To add to the fun, we're going to have a contest. From now until Sept. 17, plan and take your break, snap a photo and share on social media using #pwctakesabreak (in keeping with the spirit of things, you should do this before or after your time off -- not during!). You’ll be included in a drawing for money you can use to make your next break even more fun. Read the details here. Team, our commitment to Be well, work well is essential to who we are as a firm -- and disconnecting from work is part of taking care of ourselves. Many of you have told me how excited you are for our upcoming July 4th break and the “guilt-free” time off -- I am too! I hope you'll take this gift of time and enjoy it -- and try to plan for some additional vacation too. Success is a team sport at PwC -- and that includes being successful at unplugging and getting away. What you do is up to you, but I hope you’ll book the time, plan for it and take it.

Take 5 with Beth Fish: A PwCer since high school! IFS June 6, 2018 Welcome to our IFS Take 5 series. Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. 1. Name, rank, serial number? Beth Fish, a director in National Office Services. I’m responsible for space management operations, including the team that provides the US offices with meeting and workspace support and all of the supporting technology. I'm based in Cincinnati and have been with the firm for 35 years. 2. What’s a typical day for you? I'm 100% virtual, so I spend a lot of time on conference calls! I collaborate closely with our Space Concierge team in Tampa, helping make sure they’re equipped to support our people across the US with their office and meeting space needs. Just last year they completed over 56,000 tickets! I’m also working on some exciting technology projects: we’re preparing to upgrade our meeting room and workstation booking platforms over the next year to make the user experience more flexible and responsive to people’s changing day-to-day needs. It’s really fun helping PwC’s staff be more mobile and digital. 3. How did your journey lead you to this role? I joined PwC in 1982 as a part-time word processor, participating in a "co-op" program in my senior year of high school. After high school graduation I was offered a full-time position in Office Services ordering office supplies, delivering mail and answering phones. My journey led me through various roles including receptionist, accounting and Human Resources, where I scheduled client engagement teams and supported local recruiting efforts. What followed was a combined Office Services and Human Resources role managing IFS staff in various offices, including operations. I had the pleasure of serving as director and Market Admin Leader for Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, and ultimately moved to my current position in National Office Services four years ago. I also studied at night along the way, receiving my B.S. in Accounting and my MBA -- while working full time. 4. How does your team bring value to PwC? We help make PwC a best-in-class, mobile, hoteling office environment. We work closely with National Real Estate and IT to optimize the way we use space and bring all our people a One Firm office experience. 5. What keeps you busy outside of work? I enjoy volunteering at my church. My family and I serve on many different volunteer committees. We really look forward to a yearly event where our church members help with hundreds of volunteer projects throughout the community -- from helping the elderly to assisting those with special needs to painting schools and even handling landscaping and other chores for those in need. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

It’s not the red carpet, but it’s still a big deal. For the past two years, manager Julie Womack and senior manager Edd Beese, both on the Creative Team, have served as judges for the Telly Awards, an organization that honors the best video work from advertising agencies, corporations, TV stations and production companies around the world. “I’m wowed by the talent out there,” says Julie. “Judging provides a good source of inspiration for what we do every day,” shares Edd. How did they get selected to be judges? “It’s a combination of PwC’s great relationship with the Telly Awards and that the Creative Team has consistently won many of these awards over the years,” says Julie. “They seek credentialed representatives from organizations with a solid reputation in the creative services field, and we’re honored to represent the firm,” adds Edd. Award entries typically include campaigns, commercials and product and service launches. “There are funny ones, too,” says Julie. “It’s less Hollywood and more corporate, but it’s just as thrilling for us,” says Edd. Both agree the thrill includes seeing their names on the official Tellys website. And, while all 200 judges are listed on that site, there’s no interaction between them. “We don’t know who judges what; it’s pretty hush-hush,” says Julie. “But I would love to see how my opinion matches up with theirs,” adds Edd. Julie describes the process: “Right after the entry deadline, we’re assigned submissions according to our specialty; I judge animations and Edd judges the video category. It takes two or three days to go through them all; we get about 60 each and watch them from start to finish.” Edd adds that “it’s all online so we can do it from the comfort of our own homes.” Each entry is judged against specific criteria, spanning over 100 categories, including a section for recommendations and feedback. There are also submissions from PwC’s Creative Team. “But we don’t see those, so there’s never a conflict of interest,” says Julie. Sometimes they spot a commercial on TV and notice it was one that they judged. “We love being part of the process,” gushes Julie. “The caliber of what we see is inspiring. I enjoy comparing what we do every day to our industry peers and being able to set the bar by having a voice in what’s considered the industry standard.” Edd agrees. “I like the fresh ideas and exposure to new trends. We’re always looking for new ways to deliver what we do. Judging provides a great benchmark for us.” They also share in the anticipation when the winners are announced each May. “It’s the highlight of my year,” says Julie. Edd emphasizes that it’s purely voluntary. “We don’t get paid; we do it for the glory! It’s such a privilege. When I view the material I often think to myself ‘the work we do at PwC is just as good!’” If your project requires creative video services, you can start a conversation with the Creative Team by filling out a request. The team provides a wide range of high quality, PwC branded services like studio and on-location filming, animation and video editing. Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

The OFRO Tax self-study series is required for Associates, Senior Associates and Managers and should be completed the earlier of 12 months of the courses being posted to your Vantage account or promotion to the next staff level. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the OFRO Tax expectation is for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility. Completion requirements: OFRO Tax series training should be completed within the timeframe specified. Required training will be posted to your Vantage account. Promotions to the next staff level carry a OFRO Tax training completion requirement in FY19, similar to the annual CPE requirement. The required courses for your staff level can be accessed through your Vantage account, and the titles begin with "US Tax Q&amp;RM": Manager Courses: Manager 1 - Targeting a Client Manager 2 - Engaging the Client Manager 3 - Analyzing Independence Manager 4 - Negotiating the Contract Manager 5 - Performing the Engagement * Documentation Training, * Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) (for IAS, PCS, PFS, Law Firm Services, Investment Management and Real Estate staff) Sr. Associate Courses: High Risk Engagements Engagement Acceptance for Senior Associates Contracting for Senior Associates Independence for Senior Associates Reportable Transactions * Documentation Training, * Performing the Engagement - KB2 Data Security, * Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) (for IAS, PCS, PFS, Law Firm Services, Investment Management and Real Estate staff) Associate Courses: Client Acceptance for Associates Contracting for Associates Engagement Acceptance for Associates Independence for Associates Professional Responsibilities for Associates * Documentation Training, * Performing the Engagement - KB2 Data Security, * Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) (for IAS, PCS, PFS, Law Firm Services, Investment Management and Real Estate staff) * Note: if you took Documentation , Data Security, or FROR during your previous staff level, you do not have to retake the course as long as your Vantage and/or Compliance dashboard show a completion.

A data breach can expose personal data like payment information and passwords. Here are some actions to help you stay safe if your data has been compromised. Change your password -- By changing your password with the affected organization, you reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your data. You should also change the passwords on accounts that share login details. Check your financial statements and accounts -- If card or payment information has been part of the breach, review your statements to verify that no unauthorized payments have been made. If you notice unusual transactions or are otherwise concerned, contact your provider and follow their advice. You should also check your credit bureau reports annually to confirm accuracy. Watch out for unsolicited calls and messages -- If your contact information has been compromised, you may see an increase in unsolicited emails, calls or text messages. Stay vigilant, never provide personal information if you can’t verify the source, and report any suspicious emails — here's what to look for. Try the new “phish” button in your Google Mail side panel to report it. Be aware of what you say -- PwC serves many organizations. As a representative of our firm, you should be cautious about posting anything on social media or speaking publicly about specific breaches. This could damage relationships or otherwise reflect negatively on the firm. See the US Public Communications and Social Media Policy for more details. At PwC, we take the protection of information we hold extremely seriously. Advanced security measures and specialist security teams monitor our network and systems around the clock to safeguard data.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I’m My Tran, senior manager and learning architect in Learning &amp; Development. I’m based in San Francisco and have been with the firm for nine years. What’s a typical day like for you? I’m always designing or building something! As a learning architect, I create learning solutions for our people. I love how interactive my job is; lots of problem-solving keeps things interesting! From tactical design to technology solutions, finding ways to create programs that enhance the knowledge and development of our people is my passion. I’m like any other architect: I work closely with internal teams to build a “blueprint” of the program design, then confirm that the plans are structurally sound before building the final product. For the past year I’ve spent a lot of time with my team designing the PwC Digital Badge Program*, which is part of Digital Upskilling under Your Tomorrow. How did your journey lead you to this role? As a campus hire, I began as an auditor in Assurance. The firm’s commitment to flexibility and infinite learning was a real draw for me; I received my master’s degree in industrial organizational psychology while working full time. A constant desire to try new things led me to the Learning &amp; Development team. I was excited for a way to bring my master’s degree to life as a learning consultant to our people, which ultimately led to designing and delivering learning solutions around the country. In my current role, I focus on solving complex business problems, including helping to create our first PwC Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Coursera, an online library of courses that are globally available to our people, for free. It’s been a natural progression; each role has led to the next one. Working with my team to help others has always been the best part of my career journey! How does your team bring value to PwC? We love finding ways to transform a creative vision into a reality to solve important problems. Imagine creating a wish list and finding ways to achieve everything on the list. Digital badges are a great example: They tell the digital story of our people, allowing us to be recognized as infinite learners both inside and outside the firm. The beauty of digital badges is they are yours; you can take them with you even if you leave the firm. They show your commitment to your development journey in today’s data-driven culture. We’re so excited to provide a way to tell our digital stories and highlight the skills we acquire throughout our careers. We’re pretty proud of that! What would people be surprised to know about you? I end each week with yoga. Whether indoors or out, yoga is my go-to for relaxing, recharging and reflecting on the day. Another way I recharge is by doing home renovations with my husband. We just completed a two-year overhaul of our house; we gutted everything and rebuilt it from the frame up. So I guess building and design really is in my blood! * Currently the Digital Acumen knowledge badge is available firmwide to partners and staff who complete all four Digital Quests by June 30, 2019. While the full digital badge program is currently only available to Digital Accelerators, it will be rolled out firmwide in FY20. Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

I want others to know about the important work we do, and I also want talented people who share our values and sense of purpose to learn more about our profession, so I wrote about this on LinkedIn this week. I understand that there’s always room for continued improvement and vigilance in carrying out our role in financial reporting. And it’s human nature to focus on the times when things don’t go as they should. But -- as an optimist -- I think we should spend time looking at everything that goes right because of the hard work, courage and discipline of people in our profession. Quality financial reporting provides a foundation for millions of people who invest their money to consider as they save for a home, for their kids’ education, and for retirement. Our role in the financial reporting profession is a noble and important one. Next week, on Sept. 27, we’re once again joining with others in our profession to let people know we’re #auditorproud. See PwC Inside for resources and details on how to participate if you want to be part of this special day to celebrate the audit profession -- and all of us are invited to share our pride. Even though our work is quiet and behind the scenes -- our impact is big. If you’ve got anyone in your life who wonders just what it is that auditors do, I hope you’ll share this with them and do it with pride!

For some, it’s about hitting the gym to take a yoga class or leaving early to see a child’s soccer game. But for Simona Codreaunu and Armando Moss it’s an opportunity to reunite with loved ones in their hometowns: Simona Codreaunu: With tears in her eyes and a heart full of hope, Simona said goodbye to family and friends in 2005. She left Romania, her native country, to launch a career with PwC in Boston. “It was difficult to leave my home and travel halfway across the globe,” Simona said. “But I was excited to start a new chapter in my life. The opportunity to join PwC right out of college was too good to pass up and made the move worth it.” Simona regularly used her vacation time to visit her family in Romania. When the firm began its journey to a more flexible culture in 2011, she had an idea. “I would typically take a two-week vacation every year for my trips back home. With flexibility, I proposed to extend the trip to four weeks by working for two and vacationing the other two,” she said. Simona’s team and clients supported the plan, and soon her July trip to Romania became an annual tradition. Thanks to our tech-enabled firm and culture of flexibility, Simona is able to deliver quality service from halfway across the globe. And every year, she returns to Boston rejuvenated and happy. “The key is communicating with your team,” she said. “Some people are reluctant or scared to ask for flexibility. But there’s no need to feel that way. Speak up if that’s what you want, and your team will support you.” Simona hopes her flexibility story will inspire others to seek the right work/life balance that fulfils them and allows them to be their best self at work. Armando Moss: A member of the Bahamas National Swim Team, Armando travels from Cincinnati to his native island twice a year for competitions and to reconnect with family. Recently, an urgent personal matter came up that required him to remain there for an extended period of time. “I had an up-front and honest conversation with my manager,” Armando recalled. “I proposed a solution that combined vacation with flexibility. I assured my team that the flexibility would be used to get my work done and not to relax on a beach or hang out with family. The team trusted me and fully supported my proposal.” Armando connected with a Talent Consultant at PwC’s Bahamas office to see if he could work out of the local office. “They welcomed me with open arms,” he said. “I remember walking in on the first day. My laptop immediately connected to the network and I thought, ‘Wow, PwC is truly embracing a One Firm approach and global mindset.’” Armando was greeted by another pleasant surprise on his first day: “A Human Capital manager sent an email to the entire office introducing me and encouraging people to make me feel at home. It was an incredible feeling,” he said. Armando returned to his Cincinnati office feeling empowered to ask for flexibility, grateful for it and happy to know that he can continue to carry the Team Bahamas’ flag from country to country while pursuing a career at PwC. Clearly, flexibility is not a “one size fits all” concept, and it’s up to teams and individuals working together to define it for themselves. Do you have a flexibility story to share? Let us know. Remember: The firm must manage a variety of risks when a flexibility arrangement involves cross-border travel. For example, your travel must comply with immigration laws and you will be personally responsible for personal tax implications that may arise. Your HR representative can connect you with the appropriate teams to make sure your flexible work arrangements are compliant with firm policies. Also, our Flexibility2 Spark site provides tips and best practices.

When new hires join PwC, a lot is riding on one component: the ambassador. These are people who self-nominate as the go-to person to help new joiners get acclimated. They’re ready to answer questions about all aspects of the firm, such as: “What should I wear on my first day?” “How is the firm organized?” “How do I track my time?” “What’s a Snapshot?” Navigating PwC is not always easy. Having an ambassador helps new joiners learn the firm and feel confident in their new roles -- and help them know where to go for help if they need it. Our onboarding program is market-based, which helps new joiners connect with their teams and their offices right away. Following this design, ambassadors are matched whenever possible with new joiners who are in their line of service, city and same staff level. This matching rubric helps ensure maximum connectivity between the ambassador and the new joiner. Want to help new joiners acclimate to the firm? Self-nominate today! “My ambassador was invaluable to me as I started with PwC,” said Nancy Geery, a senior associate on the Talent ID team. “She helped me assimilate and understand our culture. I felt comfortable to ask her anything and knew she would get right back to me.” Nancy’s ambassador, Manager Sheila Robinson agrees. “The way we onboard new joiners now by connecting people to their home offices is really smart,” she said. “Giving each new joiner an ambassador is a great way to help them get to the stage where they can take the training wheels off.” Putting herself in her new joiner’s shoes helped Barbora Silovska, an experienced associate. “I wanted to help her ease into her first week and make sure she knew there was someone there to answer questions.” The time commitment expected of ambassadors is manageable. In general, it’s a total of three to five hours over the new joiner’s first six months. During the new joiner’s first week, ambassadors take their new joiners out to lunch so they can get to know each other. After that, new joiners will reach out when they need help, and ambassadors will check in periodically to see how things are going. Experienced associate Ayodele Adefila summed it up well: “The ambassador program is a differentiator for PwC to help people feel on solid ground from the beginning. I saw first hand how important it is.” Associate ambassadors needed soon! Starting in January 2019, the ambassador program will expand to new campus and entry level hires, so we’ll be calling on hundreds of associates throughout the firm to self-nominate and serve as ambassadors at that time.

Partners and staff connected, collaborated and enriched each other’s Agile &amp; DevOps practices at this two-day, One Firm summit Agile &amp; DevOps methodologies have revolutionized the software development process and allowed organizations to provide their customers with digital products and services in less time. Our people are using Agile &amp; DevOps to transform organizational culture, practices and processes by leveraging lean thinking and automation. At the recent summit, participants from 13 countries engaged in group discussions about what our clients are looking for in this space and shared their experiences and capabilities. One of the participants, Advisory Senior Manager Linda Visser, reflects, “What I loved most was the chance to connect with colleagues from different countries and lines of service, who all brought different perspectives. It was helpful to hear about and learn from their experiences.” The summit culminated with a Shark Tank-style session where participants identified six strategic initiatives that will make a difference for our firm and clients. Participants plan to build on their momentum and reconvene next year in Europe. The Agile &amp; DevOps Global Leadership Summit is just one way our firm is working to continuously improve and how our people are coming together as One Firm to better serve our clients and grow our careers.

With the help of our Well-Being Rewards program through Virgin Pulse, you can eat, drink, be merry and take care of yourself this season. One Dallas cybersecurity team is already getting a head start. “We’re a competitive 10-person group,” said team member Steven Son. “Since the app’s launch, we’ve created a bunch of five-day step challenges. It’s fun to see everyone vying for first place with nothing but pride on the line. It definitely increased the amount we move each day. I’ve even seen people walk in place or take the long route to meetings just to increase their steps.” To give themselves a competitive advantage, some members wait until the end of the day to sync their steps, leaving others to guess the amount they need to beat. One member went out for a late run on the final day of the challenge, to beat the top scorer. And a few people have happily reported achieving their weight loss goals as a result of their step challenges. To keep things interesting, the team changes up the challenges. “We’ve used the traditional step challenge -- who has the most steps in five days -- and we’ve also developed creative challenges,” said Steven. Among the competitions: be the first person to hit 50,000 steps, and beat the previous week’s top scorer. Taking thousands of steps each week has not only helped members rack up reward points, but it’s also led them to become more health conscious and encourage other healthy habits. Steven said the experience has brought the team closer together and improved morale at the office. “I encourage other teams to take advantage of the app, especially during busy season or the holidays when it’s easy to get distracted from things like exercise.” Haven’t joined the new Well-Being Rewards Program yet?

Protection of confidential data is part of our One Firm disciplined approach to how we provision, store, secure, use, expose and access data. This is an increasingly sensitive area for our clients, and this change is being made to enhance our data-protection controls. Data governance is at the heart of the firm’s strategy and is an underpinning of digital enablement. What’s changing? Saving files to any sort of removable media device, including firm-issued encrypted USB drives, will no longer be permitted. You will be able to transfer files from an encrypted device to your PC; however, changes cannot be saved back to the device from your PC. Note that you cannot edit a file on the removable media and then save it to your laptop. You will have to copy or move a file to your laptop first, then you may edit. How will this impact my work? We anticipate minimal impact to partners, staff and contractors. Several engagement teams are already using secure sites within their line of service or client-specific web applications to share data. Here is a list in Spark of preferred methods of data transmittal and collaboration tools. What if a client gives me a USB flash drive? Many clients are also moving away from the use of removable media devices. However, if you do need to access data from a client-issued USB, you will be able to save files from the encrypted device to your PC. What if my PC is not big enough to hold all of my files? Our new Windows 10 PCs have far more storage space than our previous PCs. You should review your files at the end of each engagement or project, save all documentation to the appropriate system of record and dispose of any files that are not subject to retention. What if there is an urgent situation, and I absolutely need to use removable media? While we expect that these instances will be rare, there may be situations in which a removable media device is the only solution. To request temporary permission, review policy guidance and submit a security exception request with appropriate approval. How do I submit a security exception request? Details about the Exception Request Process are available on Spark. What if my team already had an exception? You will not be impacted. Partners, staff and contractors that currently have exceptions will be granted exceptions on day one. What other information protection changes are taking place? The Information Protection Principles (IPP) have been updated to reflect the security measures around removable media devices. We’ve also added information to help you understand highly confidential information and the steps you need to take to help protect it. You can review the IPPs and a summary of recent updates here.

Thousands of you have already downloaded the new Hangouts Chat mobile app. We’ve seen praise for features like Chat rooms, Meet integration and the ability to send images (which may have something to do with GIFs, but we like fun, too). You also had some great questions we’ll address here. How is Google Chat different from “classic” Hangouts? Here’s a sampling of the major differences. Chat lets you: Send screenshots, transfer files and share documents Create “Rooms” for your project or team, where you can save data and conversation history for six months (you’ve already created nearly 1500 Rooms!) Send “Direct messages” that disappear after 24 hours, just like Hangouts Start a Meet videoconference with one click Chat with PwC colleagues in all global territories currently using Google How do I access Chat? Is there an app? Download the Hangouts Chat mobile app from PwC’s App Store. We may release a desktop app for PC at a later date, but for now we use Chat right in Chrome: visit chat.google.com (right-click the browser tab to pin it). Remember, this is a newer tool and -- like us -- Google is focused on continuous improvement. What will happen to the old Hangouts? Google will keep Hangouts available for some time as Chat continues to evolve, but Google plans to retire Hangouts. One-to-one messages shared in Chat will be visible in Hangouts and vice versa. However, Rooms, screenshots, files, documents, Group messages and invitations to Chat groups will only be shareable in Chat. Why am I getting multiple notifications? If you have both Chat and Hangouts open, you may see two notifications for each message -- it’s best to choose just one tool. You can manage your notifications to allow or block each app, and also adjust notifications in the tools themselves. In Chat, click the gear icon and select Notification settings. In Hangouts, click the three dots → Options → Notifications. (Google recently changed how Chrome manages notifications -- with pop-ups in your PC’s Action Center in the lower-right corner -- but this is not caused by Chat.) What about Salesforce Chatter? Can we get Slack instead? Google Chat doesn’t replace Chatter. You should continue to use your current Salesforce Chatter groups to connect with your Account teams and for all Salesforce-related information. And no, we won’t be getting Slack anytime soon due to document retention and other security concerns. Can we talk about client work? You can use Chat just like you used Hangouts -- for both direct and group messages. However, that means that you should not use Chat or Hangouts for discussions covering information subject to an OGC legal hold. Don't post data about US clients or engagements in Google Chat Rooms, where it will be retained for six months. As always, follow the US Google Business Rules. How can I learn more?

As part of our Your Tomorrow strategy, the Audit Committee Reporter Tool includes ways to digitize and simplify engagement work to help deliver enhanced quality and valued insight to our clients. Specifically, the new tool which is a Powerpoint add-in powered by Templafy, allows you to: Pre-populate your audit committee report template with engagement team and client specific information. Include board appropriate trending topics through a live feed of current thought leadership. Easily access firm approved libraries of images and infographics, if desired. Still curious about how these features will benefit you and your team? Hear why Bud Thomas, a partner in the Cleveland, Ohio office, values the consistency the tool creates in the communication process with clients, essentially eliminating the variability in Audit Committee reporting from engagement to engagement and streamlining the messaging. And learn how Michelle Geller, a senior manager in Florham Park, New Jersey, and her team were inspired by the Audit Committee Reporter Tool to rethink the visuals (graphics and tables) they used to summarize areas of focus and content delivery -- resulting in reducing the number of pages in their report by more than half! If it’s your first time using the tool, don’t sweat it! Check out the “how to” video we released in PwC Inside back in June to help get you started.

USAA steps it up with PwC's Source to Pay Integrated Solution. Advisory May 2, 2019 Client problem: The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Fortune 500 diversified financial services company offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families who serve, or served, in the United States military. Due to an increase in assets, USAA jumped from a mid-tier to a large-tier bank, which meant more stringent regulatory requirements. The client requested an independent assessment of its overall Procurement and Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) capabilities. We delivered an elevator pitch (literally), which led to displacing our competitors who were midway through a TPRM project with the client(ouch)! We created a Magic Moment... We quickly demonstrated our value through an xLOS unified approach to an integrated Procurement and TPRM operating model. We staged a mock elevator ride for each of the team leads to share their workstream pitches. They were asked random questions by their team — which had been previously taped under their chair — leading to laughter and relaxed body language which changed the mood in the room instantaneously. This approach allowed personal perspectives to shine and brought meaningful conversations and an overall positive outcome. The USAA Program PMO ended the meeting with a smile saying, “We never have meetings like this at USAA.” We have increased the firm revenue from $700k to $35 million in less than 18 months. The solution and value we brought Leveraging the Source to Pay Integrated Solution, we incorporated the vision, policy, and value management framework and roles. Through additional value capture analysis, we have also projected year-over-year savings of at least 1% - 3% on $3.3B of addressable spend. Investing the time and energy upfront to deeply understand the client’s true needs allowed us to develop our winning approach, which incorporated elements of the Risk &amp; Regulatory and Fit for Growth platforms. We automated various processes to remove redundancies, and we reduced complexity by standardizing practices, policies, and procedures. Meet the USAA Team! Thanks also to the following leadership team members: Becky Mackin, Martin Thomas, Rob Walley, Brett Anton, Charles Bruen, Michael Clark, Mirna Elia, Steven Klatt-Lasso, Jared Larkin, Leah Odom, Katee Puterbaugh, Akil Rao, Dan Schultz, Dominic Sugrue, Eric Willyoung What is Source to Pay? Source to Pay is more than a process, it’s a holistic approach, encompassing both Source to Contract and Procure to Pay. Source to Contract (S2C) applies to most of the upfront strategic initiatives, selecting and contracting with suppliers. Procure to Pay (P2P) is the transactional buying process of the good or service. The S2P process spans multiple stakeholder groups like Procurement, Finance, Tax &amp; Treasury, Risk &amp; Controls, and Business Units and is enabled by key functionality to create and efficient user experience.

We'll update this article when we're ready to proceed -- thanks for your patience. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It’s almost time for your PC to get the latest version of Windows 10! These annual system updates are required for your online safety and our firm’s compliance responsibilities. You won’t be able to use your PC for up to an hour, and the process can take two hours in total. When is this happening? The upgrade will roll out by LoS over the coming weeks, starting this week with IFS. Upgrades must be completed by Dec 30. After that time, Microsoft will no longer support the older version of Windows 10, and you won’t be able to connect to PwC’s network. But don’t worry — we’ve allowed plenty of time so you can plan when to upgrade. What to expect during your Windows 10 upgrade This update consists of two stages, and each can take up to an hour. You can use your PC during the initial stage, but you won’t be able to during the latter. Here’s what will happen: You’ll receive a pop-up message labeled Restart Utility. If it’s not a convenient time, you may defer for a week (more on this below). To continue with the upgrade, select Install; the update will begin in the background. You can continue to use your PC. 2. When it’s time to proceed, you’ll see a restart notification. Note that after you select Restart Now, you won’t be able to use your PC for up to an hour. Save all your data and restart promptly (the PC will restart on its own after two hours). 3. During installation, you’ll see the screen below. The update can’t be paused or deferred at this point; any interruption could cause a critical error. Your PC will automatically reboot several times. No action is needed, so take a break! You’ll know the upgrade is complete when you see your Windows logon screen. Now your PC is up to date, and it’s business as usual. Did you defer? Restart the upgrade in Software Center If you defer the initial pop-up, you don’t have to wait until you get the next one. Software Center is the new home to install all firm-provided software (it replaces Software Installer; for details refer to this guide). To restart the Windows 10 upgrade: Click the Windows Search icon, type Software Center and select it from the menu. On the “Updates” tab, select “Feature update to Windows 10…” and click Install. You can continue to use your PC while the installation begins (this can take up to an hour); the process will continue as described in step two above. Questions?

Experienced Associate Chris Manuszak and Manager Patrick McFall run marathons to boost their energy and find balance, even during the busiest periods. With the support of their colleagues, they’re crossing finish lines in impressive style. Patrick competes in some of the world’s toughest endurance races. Earlier this month, he finished a 155-mile (250 km) race through the African Namib desert. This was his third ultra-marathon, having previously run through the Atacama Desert and the mountains of Patagonia in Argentina. According to Patrick, “PwC’s culture of flexibility and well-being made it possible to train for and travel to these international marathons. Despite our hectic work schedule, my peers and leadership team encouraged me to pursue my personal goals. I’m grateful to work for a firm that values its people and prioritizes well-being.” Chris completed the Boston marathon in April and fulfilled his goal of racing three marathons over the past year. “It wasn’t easy training through the cold winter in Michigan, especially while consistently working 50+ hour weeks and fulfilling various client obligations,” he says. “Through it all, my team supported my goals, even though my morning runs meant I would come in later some days. With their help, the hard work paid off and I finished the race in Boston with a time of 2:58.” Patrick and Chris recognize the importance of well-being and understand how PwC’s commitment to flexibility can help them meet their personal goals. By communicating with their teams and setting reasonable expectations, they achieved their marathon ambitions while also fulfilling their client-service obligations. Do you have personal goals you want to achieve and need some time away? Put your plans on the agenda for your next team meeting. Talk with your team about how you can protect the time so you can disconnect and recharge and then help your teammates do the same. Share your well-being story here.

This award comes from Forrester Research, adding to similar leadership awards for the Cybersecurity and Privacy practice. In the report, Forrester’s Jeff Pollard, Vice President of Global Risk and Security Research, and Claire O’Malley, Director of Research state: “PwC shines with IP-based consulting enhanced by delivery teams. PwC recognised earlier than its competitors that it could win clients by demonstrating that its unique IP led to successful client engagements.” The report also calls out our Cybersecurity &amp; Privacy Innovation Challenge program: “PwC has a robust innovation program that allows consultants to create new ideas and enroll in an internal incubator. If accepted, winners eschew delivery responsibilities as they iterate on new services to make them enterprise ready, find product/market fit, and roll them out to the consulting organisation.” Mohamed Kande, US and Global Advisory Leader, added: "We are thrilled that PwC is recognized as a leader in cybersecurity consulting services by Forrester Research.

Be well, work well is a central part of our Your Tomorrow strategy — and that includes not only physical well-being, but also taking care of our emotional and mental well-being. As you heard on the Firmwide Town Hall, our new Ginger Emotional Support app provides confidential emotional health support for each of us and our family members (age 18+)1 at no cost. Live coaches can chat with you on demand via the app anytime, anywhere. It's free, convenient and completely confidential — any information you share is kept private between you and your coaches. You do not need to be enrolled in a PwC medical plan in order to take advantage of this service. What can you connect with an emotional health coach about? Coaches ask questions to get a clear understanding of your lifestyle and goals to create a personalized plan. Ginger coaches can help with: Achieving goals Recovering from loss Building self-esteem Improving communication Getting through a hard day To get started: Visit PwC's Ginger registration site at http://bit.ly/gingerpwc. On that page, register to access Ginger by entering your PwC Google email address2. You’ll receive a welcome email from Ginger with three access codes - one for you, and two for your spouse/domestic partner/dependents (age 18+) should they choose to use the service. If you need additional codes for other dependents, contact the Ginger team at help@ginger.io. Download the Ginger Emotional Support app from the PwC App Store (available for Android and iOS). Once in the app, enter the unique code that was sent to your PwC email address. From there, you'll be able to select any email address you choose. How is emotional health coaching different from therapy? Coaching is solely focused on providing day-to-day support and guidance, and helping develop the skills you need to overcome a barrier or achieve a goal. The goals of therapy are broader. Therapy is designed specifically for people who need to deepen their self-awareness or better understand their thoughts and feelings. After working with you, a coach may recommend therapy, depending on your goals. If you already work with a therapist, you can still rely on a coach for additional day-to-day support. To be our best, we need to take care of ourselves. Even if you feel like you don’t need this resource right now, it’s good to know that help is there whenever and wherever you need it. If you want to learn more about Ginger, check out the FAQs or email the Ginger team at help@ginger.io. And, keep an eye out for colleagues walking around the office wearing green ribbons in support of reducing the stigma around mental health in honor of Mental Health Month. 1 Partners and staff, and their spouse/domestic partner and dependents age 18+. 2 If you are a new hire, it may take 10-14 days before you can register with Ginger due to file transmission timing.

One Firm Risk Organization April 18, 2019 It’s critical to keep in mind the importance of documenting our work, including significant discussions -- internally and with the client -- throughout the engagement. All substantive client discussions related to the engagement -- including phone calls -- should be documented and included in the engagement file in DMS. Engagement teams should use professional judgment in deciding which client discussions and/or phone calls are “of substance” to the engagement, as well as in the overall preparation of the documentation. It’s recommended that engagement teams review the Documentation Toolkit for guidance on appropriate documentation. Useful tools and templates are available in the Toolkit to assist with the documentation process, such as a template that can be used to document verbal advice provided during client discussions and phone calls. The “File to TaxDMS” button - a Chrome extension available for download from the PwC Chrome Store - makes it easier to file Google emails and email attachments to DMS with a few simple clicks. Access this File to DMS from Gmail - Quick Reference Guide for instructions on how to add and use the “File to TaxDMS” button. As a reminder, the quality and contemporaneous filing of appropriate documentation for engagements is formally being assessed as part of the Tax Office Review program, including the documentation of substantive client discussions related to the engagement. For additional information related to the Tax Office Review Documentation Evaluation, please access this link for a template of the assessment and relevant help guidance. For any questions about Google, please refer to the Google PwC Spark page. For any questions about documentation protocols, please contact the OFRO Tax team.

Just like updates to apps on an iPhone, we continuously make improvements to Salesforce functionality and capability, based on your feedback and the latest technology. Here’s what’s new and improved in the Aug. 6 release: Unlocking won opportunities is more convenient The Opportunity Owner and Opportunity Lead can now unlock a won opportunity to make edits if needed. After clicking the “Unlock Opportunity” button, details on the opportunity are editable for the next seven days. At that point, the opportunity will close automatically unless the Owner or Lead adjusts the stage from “won” to a previous stage. Connect closed opportunities without reopening Click on the "Connect Existing Opportunity" button to connect existing closed opportunities without having to re-open them. Also use the button to connect multiple opportunities. Searching for users to add to an opportunity team just got easier When adding team members to an opportunity team, searching for a person’s name will show you the name, territory, LoS and email address. These additional fields will help to distinguish between people who have the same name. New “Role” field in Contacts adds helpful details A new field for “Role” on the Contact page standardizes how contacts can be grouped by their functional area within an organization. This field, located above “Buying Role,” includes finance, human resources, IT, internal audit, legal, marketing, operations, risk &amp; compliance, sales, strategy, tax, executive, audit committee and board member. Post-meeting notes are easier to find You can now find notes created from an Introhive post-meeting capture digest on the client record in the activities tab under the “Past Activities” heading as a “Closed Task.” Release outage While enhancements are made, Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, Aug. 3 at 9 p.m. ET to Sunday, Aug. 5 at 11 a.m. ET.

It’s our strategy to be paid for the value we deliver and the Your Tomorrow investments we’re making to tech-enable our services and processes. With One Firm Smart Pricing, we’re evolving our pricing focus. Historically, we’ve priced primarily based on rates and hours. Going forward, we will leverage both traditional and Alternative Fee Arrangements (AFAs) — where appropriate — to make sure our pricing captures the value we deliver through our solutions. Learn more about the story behind Smart Pricing in this short video. Learn more: We launched a new One Firm Smart Pricing site. This site, which is also available as an app in PwC’s App Store, is your one-stop shop for all things Pricing and includes playbooks, SmartGuides, videos, podcasts, FAQs and more. At the time of launch, partners, directors and managers have access to the site. For all other team members, please work with your managers to discuss your role in getting smart on our pricing strategies. Remember, while we are transitioning to AFAs, our existing risk management and independence policies will not change, particularly as they relate to contingent fees, value-based fees, discretionary fees and phased engagements with restricted entities and contingent fees for all tax engagements. If you have questions, be sure to talk with our OFRO independence and risk management resources. What this means for your line of service: We know that each LoS is in a different place today. On the microsite, you’ll find a wealth of information in the Line of Service Resources section: Tax, Assurance, Risk Assurance or Advisory. Continue to watch for more information from your LoS Pricing leader. What’s coming next: In the coming months, we’ll introduce business guidelines and preferred pricing structures for many of our services and products, a Smart Pricing tool for select businesses and products and upskilling opportunities related to pricing and value acumen. Here’s what you can do now: Everyone has the opportunity to get to know our pricing strategy and where we are heading. For those that have access to the microsite, here are some ways to get started: Make a move on the Pricing Gameboard for the key Pricing Structures and Enablers. Visit your LoS pages on the site to learn more from the LoS perspective. Pricing questions? Check-out the FAQs. Need a pricing definition? See the glossary.

Now reach more PwCers with Google Meet's new Live Stream feature. Live Stream is ideal for when you anticipate a lot of PwC viewers and don’t need to interact directly with them (e.g., you don’t need to chat with them or track their attendance). This tool is also a great option to manage which attendees are able to contribute to the Meet versus view only. Keep in mind that just like link sharing, any PwC Live Stream viewer or participant can further share the link with others in the PwC network. Since attendance isn’t tracked, the owner/organizer will not know how many other individuals view the content. Don’t use Live Stream to discuss confidential or sensitive info. Live streams are only viewable to those with PwC Google accounts — external clients or colleagues are not able to view. Again, live stream links can be shared anywhere within the PwC network and the Meet owner won’t have the ability to determine who streamed the Meet. As with all things Google, be sure to follow the Global Google Business Rules and US Business Rules when using these tools. How to schedule a Live Stream Create a Google Calendar invite. Click Add conferencing and select Hangouts Meet. Then, click the Hangout Meets drop down menu and select Add Live Stream. Your Calendar invite will then have two links — one for the Meet and another for the Live Stream. Those who join the regular Meet link can broadcast on the Live Stream, so only include presenters in that invite. It’s best to create a separate calendar invite for the Live Stream attendees. Live Stream is available to any individual who has a PwC Google account. How to start your Live Stream When you start your Meet session, you’ll see a prompt to start streaming (or click the three dots at the bottom and select Start streaming). A red “Live” alert will appear in the top left to let you and your participants know you’re live streaming. For more info, refer to these FAQs.

These relationships are absolutely critical, which is why mentoring is a cornerstone of our Access Your PotentialⓇ commitment. Many of us were fortunate to have someone in our lives who played this role, helping us with everything from applying for financial aid to choosing a college major. Too many students across the country may not be so lucky, especially those seeking to become the first in their families to go to college. In fact, only 27% of first-generation students earn a degree after four years, compared to 42% of students who come from families with higher-education experience. Hundreds of PwCers are stepping up to close this gap by paying it forward -- sharing the guidance they themselves received, along with their own personal experiences, as part of ongoing mentoring relationships with young people across the country. Here are three of their stories: Jordan Jobs, New York Metro, iMentor Joining iMentor has been a great experience. iMentor pairs young professionals with public high school students in low-income communities to provide mentorship through their high school years, and ultimately help them through the college application process. As a young black woman with few visible role models growing up, I was inspired to join iMentor to guide another young woman to achieve her dreams of attending college. I have had the pleasure of getting to know my mentee, Mia, and I look forward to watching her grow. Veon Watson, Hallandale, Sunland Park Elementary School Each Career Day I present to students on career choices in digital. I provide an overview of my job as a Digital Analyst + Digital Strategist. I also highlight my experience as a Woman in STEM (especially being a minority woman) and provide encouragement to the female students on pursuing a career in STEM regardless of biases that may exist. Sunland Park is an inner-city, lower-income school that does not provide a lot of exposure for career options in this realm. Cassandra Thompson, Cleveland, College Now Greater Cleveland College Now Greater Cleveland guides students of all ages across Northeastern Ohio, helping them achieve their dreams of higher education and career success. As a mentor, I email my mentee twice a month and meet in person twice a year for the duration of their college journey. I was matched to my first mentee (pictured) this school year, so our journey began in August. In New York, Chicago or the Bay Area?

If you’re working on a project and need specific skills or extra resources, TalentLink’s Bulletin Board feature can help. What is the TalentLink Bulletin Board? The Bulletin Board is a TalentLink feature that allows you to post small and short-term assignments and projects. It efficiently connects those who need an extra pair of hands with those who are looking for new opportunities and ways to demonstrate their skills. Who can use the Bulletin Board? All partners and staff can post to the Bulletin Board to request help on internal or client work that requires 20 hours or less (e.g., client engagements, recruiting events, proposal support, internal initiatives). Everyone can also search the Bulletin Board for available opportunities and “raise their hands” to be considered for assignments. Note: Having a detailed and regularly updated TalentLink profile can help increase your chances of being selected for projects. How does it work? It’s simple! Launch TalentLink Bulletin Board or click on the “Thumbtack” icon in the left navigation from TalentLink homepage. A new window will open with all the available opportunities. Need help on a project? Just click on “Create a new role” at the top left to post it to the Bulletin Board. See a project where you can help? Click on “Consider me for this role.” See a cool role for a colleague? You can share it with anyone in the US firm by clicking the Share button under the role, then clicking + to search for the person’s last name.

How will it impact you? The US Independence Policy is changing. How will it impact you? One Firm Risk Organization Dec. 14, 2018 We’ve updated the US Independence Policy (USIP) for a number of different topics that may impact you -- regardless of your line of service, role and responsibility. The overview below highlights key updates included in this release, which is effective Dec. 14, 2018. For a comprehensive list of all USIP updates, with full details, visit the updated US Independence Policy on our One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) portal. Key updates include: Updated policies on partner rotation on audit engagements. Based on updated international independence standards that become effective this month, there are revised policies on “time off” considerations for partners on audits of public interest entities. Updated policy on assessing the execution of non-audit services. During the execution of a non-audit services engagement, group audit engagement partners should be involved in assessing that the services do not extend beyond the scope of services initially authorized. New policies on providing professional references on behalf of others. These updates address situations when a PwC partner or practice staff member is asked to provide a professional reference on behalf of another individual. Learn more View the details of these and other revisions included in this update (relating to, in part, breaches, indemnification and cumulative effects of non-audit services). To view the complete list of changes to USIP since the last update, see the Revision Table of changes or view the redlined version. Still have questions?

As we enter into a particularly busy season with fewer daylight hours, we want to remind you of precautions you can take to ensure your safety in, and traveling to and from, the office. Walk in pairs to your vehicle or public transportation. Or, if your building offers the service, have building security escort you to your vehicle. If your building has attached parking and you need to stay late, you can submit an expense to be reimbursed for parking fees if you move your car into building parking after 5 p.m. Support office security by displaying your badge -- and help make sure others do the same. If anyone attempts to follow you in without a badge, politely direct them to reception or building security. The best defense includes being alert, aware and prepared. Wherever you are, be aware of your surroundings, avoid isolated areas and be protective of your laptop and personal belongings. Get to know the security programs in place to protect and support you, your family and the firm during crisis and emergency situations. To-do, today -- some security basics: You know to dial 911 first in an emergency. But did you also know that the PwC Emergency Hotline is a critical secondary line of support and guidance for you and your family? Program the number into your mobile device today -- it’s also printed on your PwC security badge for quick reference. 1-888-755-1515 (US) 00-1-813-351-6460 (outside US, collect calls accepted) Make sure your personal information is up-to-date in Workday. Register at least one emergency contact with PwC so our crisis teams can support you when you need it. Visit our US Security site for additional resources and helpful videos on more actions you can take to protect yourself, your colleagues and the firm. Remember, you are PwC’s most important asset. We want you to be safe and secure, no matter where you are.

You can support the firm’s Responsible Business Leadership strategy in many ways -- through Access Your Potential and other volunteer opportunities, giving, Green Teams and more. Running our business responsibly means taking care to be environmentally responsible, and we’ve accomplished a lot in this area: We’ve reduced our net carbon footprint by 45% over the past 10 years. We purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) to cover 100% of the carbon emissions from our firmwide electricity use. Starting in FY19, we offset 100% of our carbon emissions from air travel through the purchase of tree reforestation efforts and other offset programs. We reduced energy consumption per employee by 40% through more efficient use of office space and encouraging people to work remotely. 63% of our office space is LEED interior certified, meeting the highest industry design standards for environmental efficiency. We reuse or recycle all of the firm's electronic waste (old IT devices like laptops and other equipment). Over the last year, we reduced our office paper consumption by 23%, a total savings amount equal to covering half of New York’s Central Park. This is not only good for the planet, but it’s also important to our clients and our business. More and more of our clients are working to improve their environmental performance, making our own commitment relevant to meeting their needs.

What we stand for: Take 5 minutes and read the Global Tax Code of Conduct. The Global Tax Code of Conduct covers the conduct of the member firms, who they should act for, and how they should act. 2. Do you have contract changes to standard terms and conditions? Here’s what you need to do. The approval of OFRO Tax is required as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process when there are changes to standard terms and conditions in a contract. To obtain OFRO Tax approval, mark “Yes” to question 2.4 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment and answer the questions that follow appropriately, providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Read more &gt; 3. Do you e-file any state returns? Important changes to the process you need to know about. A new state e-file requirement related to application software updates will impact our internal PwC e-file process. If you calculate a return on one release, you have 10 business days after the next release to transmit the return to the IRS. Once those 10 business days have passed, the return has "expired," and will not be transmitted. Read more &gt; 4. Individual Clients - What you need to know about contracting and obtaining consents and FROR confirmations. It is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols for the following contract language and policies -- Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR), Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information and Privacy Policy Notices. All Tax professionals (Associates through Partners), who provide services to individual clients - including PCS, PFS, Law Firm services, IAS, Investment Management and Real Estate practices - are required to take this course in Vantage Financial Reporting Oversight Roles. Read more &gt; 5. Do you “need to know”? Protect client and firm confidential information.

Assurance Nov. 12, 2018 Got tech skills? Don’t forget to highlight them in TalentLink! The digital skills you’re gaining on our Digital Upskilling journey are a great addition to your profiles and now all Assurance partners and staff can update the Technical Skills and Industries sections of their TalentLink profile. However, it’s important to note, as part of turning on this feature in TalentLink, there are important business rules that must be followed under the firm’s Risk Management policies: Core Assurance, Core Audit SDC, PCS, TEA Audit Technical skills tracking is allowed for Digital Skills only. Search for “Digital Skills” in the Technical Skills section and choose from the list of skills automatically displayed on screen. Skills tracking is not allowed for Audit skills or Non-Digital skill areas. In addition, proficiency/experience level for Industry should not be updated. FS BAS, Innovation &amp; Tech (excludes TEA Audit), Risk Assurance, Risk Assurance SDC, TS Technical skills tracking is allowed but not allowed for: Audit &amp; Accounting skills or Industry For example, skills in auditing Accounts Receivable, Cash, Accounts Payable, etc. should not be updated in your TalentLink profile. When you update your profile, please add your Digital Skills and then select additional technical skill areas. Refer to this guide as you fill out the section. The purpose of the technical skills section is not to list every skill achieved, but rather to answer the questions “what do I want to be known for?” and “what do I want to be found for?” You can also add skills that you don’t have today and are interested in developing. In addition to highlighting your technical (or applicable digital only) skills, this is a great time to revisit your TalentLink profile to ensure it reflects your capabilities and experiences. Take a few extra minutes to update other sections in your profile with your experiences and interests (including language) and confirm your TalentLink schedule is accurate. The information included in your TalentLink profile and schedule are actively used to help your deployment team better align your skills, experience, &amp; career interests for staffing assignments.

On February 20, more than 35 PwC professionals in Tampa participated in a Skills for Society ScopeAthon, a half-day skills-based volunteering event with eight local nonprofit organizations: Camelot Community Care, Eckerd Connects, Junior Achievement of Tampa Bay, Metropolitan Ministries, Police Athletic League, ReDefiners World Languages, The First Tee of Tampa Bay and Voices for Children of Tampa Bay. The ScopeAthon event matched three to five PwCers with one of the nonprofits to diagnose a pressing challenge and build an actionable roadmap to tackle it. The day began with a brief training session from Skills for Society collaborator, the Taproot Foundation, on uncovering the root cause of a challenge and identifying a high-impact, feasible solution. Nonprofit teams left the event with clearer paths forward on how to implement a solution on their own or through additional support from Skills for Society. This ScopeAthon provided our people the opportunity to use their skills, expand their networks and make an impact with organizations doing important work in our communities. Here’s what a two participants had to say: “I found it extremely rewarding to leverage the skills I've built over my time at PwC and use them to make a contribution to a worthwhile cause. It was a great experience to work with Metropolitan Ministries’ CEO and leadership team, listen to their challenges, provide our insights and a roadmap to help them achieve their goals.” - Jeff Lambert, director “My experience with the ScopeAThon was eye-opening and informative. It was inspiring to see the commitment of our nonprofit team to do the best for the families served by their organization. They were engaged and open to discussing their challenges, and were very interested in the process. They were excited to bring our scope proposal to their leadership to show what we'd concluded and how the organization could move forward. I found it to be a very valuable experience that I would repeat, given the opportunity.” - Monica Barrett, director How can you get involved? Skills for Society is a new approach to the way we build skills and make an impact in our communities through Your Tomorrow. We’re putting our digital and professional capabilities to work with nonprofits on some of the biggest societal challenges we face today, so we can make a difference while continuing to grow and develop. The program is currently in phase one and available in five cities, including Tampa. Want to get involved? Complete this simple interests form. Learn more about Skills for Society here.

These 50 council members were selected by their MALs and BU leaders based on their leadership skills, collaboration, and solution-oriented mindset.

We received positive feedback from previous council members and leadership suggesting that including recurring council members is beneficial to the continuity of existing ASC matters. The FY19 ASC co-leads will represent the Assurance LoS on a newly-created One Firm Staff Council. Our co-leads will strengthen how we collaborate, communicate and deliver a One Firm approach within and across our Staff Advisory Councils. The council will meet for the first time mid- November in New York and they want to hear from you! Please take time to connect with the representative(s) from your market or business unit now and throughout the year to provide your feedback and input on whatever is top of mind for you and your Peers.

But it’s not always easy to build a relationship with the board. The perfect opportunity to start a conversation: Our 2018 Annual Corporate Directors Survey provides insights from 700+ public company directors, with perspectives on topics from cultural oversight to cybersecurity to boardroom diversity. The survey is published by the Governance Insights Center -- a team dedicated to helping boards of directors meet the challenges of their critical roles and duties. Led by Paula Loop, the team meets with boards of directors, institutional executives and the C-suite to share leading practices in corporate governance; publishes practical thought leadership on boardroom hot topics; and hosts events on current governance issues. Three of our top findings provide a unique One Firm glimpse into the issues many clients are facing today: Social issues and strategy make a stronger connection Social issues are slowly making their way into the boardroom. In fact, directors are becoming more open to considering social issues when discussing company strategy. Issues such as healthcare availability and cost, resource scarcity and human rights are much higher on directors’ radars this year. The cybersecurity disconnect: Awareness is hot, crisis management is not Cybersecurity is a constantly moving target. Still, directors say they’re on the ball. They’re more comfortable with what their companies are doing around the topic, and they’re taking steps to prepare for a cyber incident. But a cyberattack can happen to any company at any time. Are boards really sure their company won’t be caught flat-footed if there’s a breach? Evaluating corporate culture: Going with your gut may not be enough A company’s culture isn’t always easy to define, but it drives what people do and don’t do. Boards need to help promote a strong culture – one that promotes the right behaviors throughout the company. So what do directors think is actually useful in their oversight role? Hearing from employees. Topping the list of the most useful metrics for evaluating the culture are employee engagement survey results, exit interview debriefs and feedback results for executives. Here are two steps you can take today to start building a stronger relationship with your client’s board: Contact Paula Loop and request a governance SME to come meet with your client’s board or management team about findings from the survey Use our Conversation starter letter to reach out to directors at your clients For more information: Visit our ACDS webpage Find our Conversation Starter letter on our US Governance Insights Center site Learn more about the Governance Insights Center Contact Paula Loop Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40556.html</url><pwc_title>Virginia Beach shooting — and being prepared </pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-10 05:41:12</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>Tim Ryan: Throughout the weekend, my thoughts were with the 12 people in the Virginia Beach community who went to work on Friday and never returned home.</pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-06-03 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:Tim Ryan</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Virginia Beach shooting — and being prepared Virginia Beach shooting — and being prepared Tim Ryan June 3, 2019 Team, Late Friday afternoon we saw another terrible and senseless shooting — this time in Virginia Beach. Throughout the weekend, my thoughts were with the 12 people who went to work on Friday and never returned home. And now their family, friends and community are grieving. While I hope that none of us ever has to experience a situation like this, our security team does plan and prepare for these and other crisis scenarios. We take measures to protect our office environments and also hold drills to practice our response to emergencies. We have an instructional video you can watch to help you prepare for active shooter situations. Sadly, we know violent events can happen at any time, so it’s important for all of us to sharpen our security instincts. As a reminder, in any threatening situation, call 911 first. You can also access support and guidance in an emergency through the PwC Emergency Hotline 1-888-755-1515 or by email (security@pwc.com). Team, I wish we didn’t have to think about preparing for events like this. And we wish that the people of Virginia Beach — as well as so many other communities — were not facing violence and loss. We'll continue to do our best to create a safe environment within PwC.

This can be an effective means of managing the Responsible Partner’s (as identified in CES) pre-approval obligations and can be extremely helpful in achieving compliance with firm policy. As background, many audit clients have a Pre-approval Framework Agreement in place, which is an approach used to obtain and document audit committee pre-approval for recurring or known (at the time of preparing the Framework) tax services to be provided to the client during the audit engagement period. For example, tax compliance and tax compliance related services provided annually and other types of detailed, pre-defined tax consulting services, may be included in a client’s Pre-Approval Framework Agreement to obtain Audit Committee pre-approval well in advance of actually engaging to provide the services. In these cases, the Framework AFS can be obtained after Audit Committee pre-approval is granted and should mirror the client’s Pre-approval Framework Agreement’s detailed scope of services for those pre-approved non-audit services. An approved Framework AFS will provide the necessary approvals to “clear the way” for engagement teams to be engaged to provide previously pre-approved tax services as requested by the client. However, care should be used to ensure that the non-audit services that are being provided clearly fall under the Framework AFS. In many cases, the Responsible Partner may still request that a separate AFS also be submitted as each project kicks off for notification/tracking purposes. If a separate AFS is requested, a best practice that should be considered is to also reference the Framework AFS at that time. Tax engagement teams should discuss with the respective Responsible Partner the procedures to be followed to obtain pre-approval for any non-audit services to be provided to their restricted clients and/or their affiliates, including whether a Pre-approval Framework Agreement has been agreed to with the client and the relevant PCAOB Rule 3524 communications have been made. If a Pre-approval Framework Agreement is not being used for your restricted client and/or their affiliate, consider having a discussion with the Responsible Partner regarding the use of a Pre-approval Framework Agreement approach. For additional information, see the Pre-approval Framework Agreements and Independence section on the Tax Independence microsite. Questions?

Some of our best candidates come from your referrals. In fact, we’ve found that candidate referrals are quick to onboard and make an impact on the business. Most importantly, they stay with the firm longer. Referring experienced candidates is easy and must be done in Workday. Simply type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to get started and find the job that suits someone you know. In order to receive credit for making a referral, you must submit your referral to a specific job. This will also give you visibility into your referral’s status throughout the process (simply type ”My Referrals” in the Workday search bar to see their progress). As an added incentive, if you you refer a candidate who is ultimately hired, you may be entitled to a referral reward. Please also note these important reminders: Only experienced referrals should be submitted through Workday. Refer to the Employee Referral Program site for guidance regarding entry-level referrals. To receive a referral reward, you must submit experienced referrals to a posted open role through Workday before your referral applies for the role. Immediately after you submit the experienced referral, the referred candidate will receive an automated email directing them to apply through a specific link. Your referral must use this referral link to apply for the role. If your referred candidate does not use the referral link, they will not be tagged as a referral and recruiters will not be notified that the candidate is a referral. For appropriate credit and status updates, referred candidates cannot be accepted through Google email or any other means except the Workday referral link. Your referred candidate’s status in Workday will not be visible to you until they have applied to the specific job via the referral link. For more information, take a moment to review the Employee Referral Program quick reference card (QRC) and policy. Make sure you follow the guidance above so you don’t miss out on a referral bonus! If you have questions about submitting referrals, please contact the Employee Referral Team.

Throughout FY19, we’re sharing Real-time recognition tips. In this article, we focus on the value of social recognition. Our world is increasingly more social because of technology and our connections to others have become essential to our growth and development. The Recognition activity feed in the Real-time recognition tool is one way we can show appreciation and motivate our colleagues by giving virtual high fives. Social recognition amplifies appreciation and strengthens relationships by creating a continuous loop of positive feedback. It enables everyone to see what people value, congratulate colleagues and be inspired to emulate the behavior. On the Recognition activity feed you can view awards received by your colleagues and add your own message of congratulations. Simply type a brief, thoughtful message and click Congratulate. Your message will appear in the feed and the recipient will receive an email summarizing the messages they’ve received. Tip! Awards with videos and photos get more congratulatory messages than those with only text, so when you’re recognizing someone, make it more meaningful and memorable by adding a photo or video. The maximum file size accepted is 40 MB. You may include a message along with your media. Refer to the User Guide for details on how to adjust privacy settings on the activity feed. Please don’t share client names, confidential information or any comments outside of our Code of Conduct in your recognition message. More info: Based on your feedback, we’ve added the option to recognize staff in the US with a $25 award. If you recognize staff in other territories, they will receive the same award level at a value in their home-country denomination. Use your Real-time recognition balance by Jan. 16, 2019 or you will lose it. Budgets are loaded twice per year to promote more frequent recognition -- half of your annual budget was loaded in the system in Sept. and the second half will be loaded on Jan. 17, 2019. (Note: You will see your spending balance during the recognition process on your PC.) Relationship Leaders can see if their assignees have been recognized by clicking the “My team” link on the Recognition home page. You can adjust the privacy settings on the Recognition activity feed.

Want to know how our Your Tomorrow efforts are going? Read our top five takeaways -- and Tim's three asks of all of us -- then get the full story by watching the replay of yesterday’s Town Hall: Your Tomorrow is happening today. Our world is evolving and PwC is evolving with it. Tim Ryan provided an update on all that’s happened since our last Town Hall back in October when we launched our Your Tomorrow strategy. Your Tomorrow is how we bring the best of the firm to our clients with more value and a more digital experience, and how we are building the skills we need to lead and thrive. Since last fall, we’ve downloaded nearly 150,000 apps from PwC’s App store (including the wildly popular Calm app), more than 45,000 of us have taken part in a habit plan as part of our Be well, work well efforts, and 3,500 of us have self-nominated to become Digital Accelerators. And our July 4 firmwide week-long shutdown was a result of the tremendous progress we made through the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge in the US, while the challenge continues in Mexico. But there’s still lots more to come. Your Tomorrow is all about our investment in you -- and in transforming PwC for a digital future. Chief Digital Officer Joe Atkinson shared a preview of what we can expect in the future as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy, including our pledge to get Digitally Fit by the end of FY19 through podcasts, quizzes, market-based events and more. He also talked about our efforts to build a world-class data platform, one that provides access to the right data anywhere, anytime, securely and on any device. He even shared a “day in the life” view of what our firm will look like 12-18 months from now, based on technology and initiatives that are already here or currently in development! We’re skill building -- in our firm and in our communities. In addition to the plan Joe laid out for digitally upskilling our own people, he shared a video that demonstrated the power of our Access Your Potential® commitment to build technology skills of students from overlooked and underserved communities through our partnership with Code.org. Access Your Potential® includes three pillars: Along with building tech skills, we continue to focus on financial literacy (building on the foundation set through our Earn Your Future® efforts) and mentoring. You can find similar Access Your Potential® volunteer opportunities on Impact Space. And the winner is … We had some amazing entries for The habit challenge, but at the end of the day, The Real Auditors of Estero took home the big prize … and the oversized plane ticket! Southeast Market People Leader Melisa Cook made the presentation to team leader Arionna Gunderman. Arionna shared that by making a couple of small habit changes, the team was able to see big results … and win the grand prize of a three-day, two-night stay at a luxury resort and round-trip airfare for each team member and a companion, and a $250 resort voucher! Read more about The Real Auditors of Estero, and all of our Top 50 The habit challenge finalists, here. Upward and peer feedback is coming back! Melisa joined Tim for a Q&amp;A segment featuring some of your most frequently asked questions. Joe provided detailed information around what’s next for our Digital Accelerators program, and Tim shared updates on our response to the #MeToo movement, telling our digital story and that our popular upward and peer feedback program would be coming back and would be better than ever, since it will now be available year-round. Upward and peer feedback functionality will be available through Workday, our new global, mobile, and cloud-based human capital system. With the Workday launch, Tim also shared that our PwC Professional framework is now simpler, clearer and aligned to our new global staff levels.

We've updated the primary credential policy! Have you heard? We've updated the primary credential policy! Assurance March 4, 2019 Effective March 1, 2019, Assurance will no longer require associates to pass a primary credential exam for promotion to senior associate. Hear directly from our Assurance People Leader, Laura Martinez, to find out what is changing and what it means for you. While Assurance no longer requires primary credential exams for promotion to senior associate, achieving a credential as early in your career as possible continues to be very important. To further support you in achieving your credential early, here are a few additional enhancements to the policy that you should be aware of: We are increasing the Assurance primary credential exam bonuses to reward those associates who pass exams early. The increased bonus awards are retroactive for all current associates and those who were promoted January 1, 2019 to senior associate who have already received a primary credential bonus. The incremental bonus amounts will be paid on April 30, 2019. Associates will have 40 hours per year of protected time to book in TalentLink to study for your primary credential exam. Your deployment team will help you schedule this time based on client demands. For those who have an expired Becker license and are eligible to renew the program at the PwC discounted price under the Becker Promise they will only be responsible to pay 50% of the cost - the firm will cover the other 50% one additional time. For all the Assurance Credential Policy details, please review the updated credential policy as it provides the pertinent information that you need to know about credential requirements. If you have any questions please reach out to your Relationship Leader or Talent Consultant. You can also refer to the following FAQ document.

Relationship Check provides a single point of entry to request a search of US firm records for relationships — such as client or supplier relationships — with an entity or individual. Where needed, it will also facilitate a request for non-US relationship data from PwC network firms and track all results in a single platform. Most importantly, the new application provides more targeted, relevant relationship data. Audit partners and staff should use My Independence Assessment — launched in November — to meet independence assessment requirements. My Independence Assessment is accessible via the Assurance Engagement Center and also provides a streamlined, easy user experience. Relationship Check and My Independence Assessment are only available for those with Salesforce licenses, typically managers through partners. Have questions or need help? Reach out to the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO). For questions specific to interpreting your relationship check results, email Ask OFRO or call (866)-844-1846 (voice mailbox only). If you have a question about navigating the new system, reach out to the OFRO Relationship Check group. For technical support, call 1-866-PwC-Help. For more information regarding Relationship Check and other OFRO tools, explore the OFRO portal.

To continuously improve their disclosures, they seek real-time insights into the questions the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is asking peer companies. Responding to this need, Gilbert Lindsay and Michael Patrick, directors on tour in National Quality Organization (NQO), created a digital platform to provide our clients an interactive, mobile experience to explore the topical areas currently trending in comments issued by the SEC staff. In doing so, they’ve moved from giving clients a once a year analysis to an agile, digital platform providing deeper, real time analysis of future SEC comment letter trends. The new platform has been a differentiator for the firm — our clients and our people. It provides clients an interactive experience resulting in improved user engagement, and helps our people stay up to date and deliver value with timely conversations. The SEC's filing review process is a key function to monitor the critical accounting and disclosure decisions applied by clients; by analyzing their comments, our platform identifies trends in the SEC’s focus areas over time and connects our clients with relevant thought leadership. Visit and share the SEC comment letter trends web site for mobile-friendly publications that will help you have timely accounting and reporting conversations with your clients.

The next step on this simplification journey is retiring unneeded Lotus Notes applications and databases. We’ll start that process Feb. 28. Read on to find out how to prepare. What to expect First, rest assured that any business-critical tasks currently operating in Lotus Notes applications and databases (things like Advisory map, financial reporting applications and work request databases) will not be retired until they have been successfully replatformed — and we’ll give you plenty of notice before that happens. However, in addition to those “high-usage” applications and databases, we’ve also identified thousands of low-user-count applications and databases that may have little business value. On Feb. 28, we will begin turning off access for those low-user-count Lotus Notes applications and databases. After a sufficient period of inactivity, retired applications and databases will be archived and eventually deleted (except those subject to an OGC Legal Hold). But wait! What about the [fill-in-the-blank] application? I need that! Your IT and business leaders have confidence we’ve identified and made plans to replatform the Lotus Notes applications and databases that have business value. However, you can double-check to see whether an application or database you use regularly is scheduled to be turned off: Navigate to this database review tool. If you discover an application or database that needs to be kept beyond Feb. 28, 2019 — including anything subject to an OGC Legal Hold — simply follow the system prompts to request an exception. Your IT leaders will review your request to help you retain the information you need or to replatform to a new system. After Feb. 28, if you realize an application or database that’s been turned off needs to be recovered, you can have it temporarily reactivated by submitting a ticket through PwC’s Service Hub. We’ll provide access for a period of time and help you find a more tech-enabled way to manage related tasks going forward. Still have questions? Visit our Data Remediation page for FAQs, tools and resources to help you find, move and appropriately store any information in Lotus Notes that continues to hold business value. Get help! Visit PwC’s Service Hub for a full list of support options, including one-on-one reservations for IT support. Next steps toward moving away from old systems Replatforming and retiring Lotus Notes applications and databases is an important step — but we also have some other outdated systems that need retiring. Here’s what you can expect as we keep moving forward: This spring, we’ll prepare to turn off (and eventually delete) legacy shared drives. By the end of FY19, we’ll put in place a new 18-month retention period on our current Lotus Notes mailboxes. (In plain English, this means we’ll start automatically deleting Lotus Notes emails when they hit the 18-month-old milestone.) We’ll also introduce similar retention policies for our Google Mail and calendar events -- and lengthier data retention policies for Google Drive, Google Keep, Sites and G+ content. (We’ll give you plenty of notice, but you can start to prepare now by refreshing yourself on our systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration.) Later this year, we’ll be ready to delete everyone’s last Lotus Notes email archive and stop issuing Lotus Notes profiles to new joiners. Remind me: Why are we doing this? The way we approach data as a firm is changing. As part of a multi-year data journey, we’ve implemented robust, modern systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration. At the same time, we’re retiring outdated data storage systems; deleting redundant, obsolete and trivial data; and implementing best-in-class guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle.

Our new One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) has simplified and improved how we get Authorization for Services (AFSs) and deliver nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as part of the engagement startup process. The AFS process is about to get simpler Our legacy teams (US TSIndependence and AFS SoSRTeam) have combined to form a new team, US AFSReview, which will perform all AFS secondary reviews required by firm policy across all lines of service, starting Sept. 4, 2018. This combined team will ensure compliance with independence rules and policies and is ready to help non-audit engagement teams navigate independence from proposal through execution as efficiently as possible. As part of the Rapid Engage process, the new US AFSReview name will automatically populate as an additional approver on AFS forms for restricted entities, with the exception of Tax. For Tax AFSs and for AFSs initiated outside Rapid Engage, simply add “US AFSReview” as an additional approver on the AFS. For questions, please email US AFSReview. New do-it-yourself guidance on pre-engagement nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) When prospective clients ask PwC to sign a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement before they’re willing to openly discuss a proposal opportunity or project, this new handy checklist can expedite our decision. If you can check all the boxes on the checklist, partners and principals can sign an NDA without further consultation, though this applies only to pre-engagement agreements, not all NDAs. Otherwise the checklist would need to go to an ecosystem contract specialist. After we are selected and the client engagement letter is signed, engagement letter confidentiality provisions take effect. For questions, connect with an ecosystem contract specialist or your Contracting Risk Management Partner.

Laurel Ostiguy, a Boston-based manager in National Office Services, couldn't ignore her dream of becoming an author any longer. "For a long time I tried to quell the overwhelming urge to write a book, until it basically wrote itself," she said. Laurel always knew she had a story inside her, even as a child. When she found herself with a two-hour, round-trip commute a few years ago, the time was right. "I had plenty of time to think the story through and literally record my thoughts, using my iPhone," she said. "And one day, I just began writing it!" She had help along the way, including advice to self-publish. "A friend introduced me to an author who provided tips on how to network and find an editor, cover designer and photographer," she shared. The more people she spoke with, the more it all seemed to fall into place. "At one point I said to myself, 'I really am doing this,' and just kept going." Her first novel, Last Goodbye, was published in 2015 and took four years to write. It was met with positive acclaim, but not before she hired beta readers to review it. "Beta readers are trained to actually rip a transcript apart to give you the absolute painful truth about your story and your writing," she said. "In my case, the feedback they provided was constructive -- and invaluable. When you get a compliment from them, it's a very big deal." Longing to Be followed in 2016, Lying in Wait comes out later this year and Lessons in Love will be released in 2020. All of her books share an ongoing storyline. "The premise of the series follows the journey of several characters from their freshman year of college through graduation, with lots of twists and turns," she said. How does she find the time to write? "I take advantage of PwC’s flexible work environment and now work from home,” she said. “Without that lengthy commute, I have more flexibility to write in the evenings and on weekends. My husband and two young children are very supportive. I love my job at PwC and I love that I can pursue my dream as an author!" A role model for aspiring authors Book signing gigs are another perk. "I love to encourage young aspiring writers,” she said. “Making connections is what it’s all about.” Laurel also donates her books to libraries and auctions. "Self-publishing is very popular these days, and I really recommend it," she said. This means she covers the cost of proofing, printing and design. The books are printed but also available online for Kindle, Nook, iPhone, Amazon and more. "And it's always a treat to read positive reviews, whether they appear in a local newspaper, on Amazon or even on Instagram," she said. Laurel is thrilled to see her passion come to life. "I used to walk in bookstores and say 'why not me?'" Indeed, why not? Find out more about Laurel and her books at www.laurelostiguy.com. Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

NOVA’s Gen Z program was focused on an enterprise-wide, multi-year digital transformation. The key objective was to implement SAP cloud solutions, in particular SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP), to restructure the antiquated supply chain and financial planning business processes, modernize the aging IT platform to decrease operational costs and streamline the supply chain to create a completely integrated ecosystem that's transparent to all functions involved. What was our proposed solution for NOVA? Using the Integrated Business Planning (IBP) Integrated Solution, and a BXT delivery method, we proposed a unifying supply chain platform leveraging the “Power or the Firm” with best practices from the IBP Integrated Solution playbook, and input from our strategy, management and technology consulting areas across the US and Canada. To solidify the relationship with NOVA and secure the win, we demonstrated chemical industry thought leadership combined with clear articulation of how PwC’s SAP IBP, IDeA, and SCOOP digital tools would deliver value. During orals, we made NOVA feel comfortable by taking extra time during breaks to walk through PwC’s pre-built digital enablers, helping NOVA understand the experience of working with us. What is Integrated Business Planning Integrated Solution? Integrated business planning (IBP) is a strategy for connecting the planning functions (sales and operations planning) in an organization to align operations and strategy with the organization's financial performance (financial planning and analysis). IBP includes functions such as demand planning, sales revenue planning, inventory optimization, product cost planning, detailed scheduling and operational expense planning. The IBP Integrated Solution team has built a delivery playbook with guidance, tools and templates to leverage, and project plans to help deliver in a repeatable and efficient way. What value will NOVA see using our solution? The Integrated Business Planning Integrated Solution will not only drive a one-time working capital reduction of $23 million for NOVA but also reduce over $1 million in annually recurring expenses. Equally important, this solution will retire the aging supply chain IT tools and create improved cross-functional visibility of key supply chain information. To date, we have already identified $12 million in finished goods inventory reduction opportunities and leveraged PwC’s SCOOP Intelligent Forecasting Platform (IFP) to improve forecast accuracy by greater than 15 percent.

We’re marking the 85th year of our work on behalf of the Academy. This is a fun and exciting night, and we can be very proud of the team that serves the Academy and the great work that they do. For me, this is also a time to reflect on the events of two years ago and the responsibility we each have to protect and enhance the PwC brand. We must never take for granted that the PwC brand stands for trust. Not all of our engagements are as visible as the Academy Awards, but getting it right the first time is something we all strive for. I was talking to Rick recently about how the team is preparing and he captured this very well. He said, “We are well aware of the attention around our work for the Academy. But just like every PwC team, we want to get it right and deliver quality. It’s a mantra for us -- if we do our job, we’ll do great.” I couldn’t agree more. So, if you’re a movie fan, I hope you’ll have fun on Sunday. But even if you are not, you might get questions from friends, family or clients. We can share our pride in our firm’s role in this worldwide event -- but we shouldn’t comment beyond that. If you are in doubt, remember our values and our professional responsibility not to talk about our clients, and that includes commenting on social media. For example, we should not be posting or commenting on likely winners from among this year's Oscar nominees. I want to thank our team, and all of you, for representing our firm well as we enjoy the excitement of Oscars night.

Remember these FROR rules and Do you work with our individual clients? Remember these FROR rules and other contracting protocols One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 23, 2019 As part of our continuous efforts to support the Tax line of service through regular communications, we are calling attention to the following contract language and policies -- Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR), Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information and Privacy Policy Notices. Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. The Tax Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains links to the templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a Privacy Notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period provides any tax service to a person in a financial reporting oversight role at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a financial reporting oversight role (FROR) in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)). Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Section 7216 consent must be obtained for all tax compliance and consulting engagements for individuals due to the nature of our business operations (e.g., use of GDM resources, third party contractors, back office support, etc.) and if the client requests that we disclose the client's tax return information to their representatives or professional advisors (e.g., the client's legal counsel, secretary, head (or CFO) of family office, etc.). This consent must be obtained prior to disclosing information to third parties. The consent must be signed by the client. Please note that the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information must be obtained annually, including in the case of a multi-year contract. Do not reduce the font size of the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information document below 12 points. This font size is required in order to comply with regulations and procedures under Section 7216. Privacy Policy Notice Tax LOS policy requires that privacy notices be sent to clients when providing individual tax (compliance and consulting) services. The GLBA Privacy Notice must be provided when the client relationship commences. For existing clients, an annual notice must be provided every calendar year. Engagement teams should be sure to use the most current engagement letter templates from the Engagement Letters Index. For your reference, below are links to frequently used documents and other helpful sites.

For these Tax services, a minimum of two approvals is required: 1. The Primary Approver (the Responsible Partner for your client as listed in CES) that is auto populated by the AFS system (usually the audit partner or the Global Relationship Partner (GRP)), AND 2. "US AFSReview" (GUID = uafsreview001), which you must manually add as a Contact and check the “Approver” box, in order for the team to be notified. (Name changed from “AFS SoSRteam” effective 9/4/18). Remember... If your AFS only includes a .pdf version of the engagement contract, produced using the CREATE for Tax tool, a copy in Word format (.docx) will need to be provided. The following link provides guidance on how to download a .docx (see video: "Need a Draft.docx copy"). Ensure the engagement letter clearly describes the proposed services and the delineation between PwC’s role and the role of the Client. Identify the Client oversight contact and explain how you know this person is both capable and willing to oversee the project. Include this information in the engagement file. For more information: Visit the AFS page for contacts and other useful information. Review the guidance at this link, or email the US AFSReview team at us.afsreview@us.pwc.com, or contact a member of the OFRO Tax team.

All Connect v2.7 sites are expected to be transitioned prior to December 31, 2018. And you’ll be glad you did. Our latest enhancement allows for files larger than 250MB to be uploaded to Connect -- helping you work more efficiently. Additional features in Connect V3 include: Faster document upload and download speeds Greater visibility across your portfolio with a new cross-site dashboard and on-time statistics Seamless Aura integration Reminder: Connect v2.7 sites will not be automatically upgraded to Connect v3. The transition process is straightforward and easy to complete but please keep in mind: Connect v2.7 will be decommissioned in 2019. All v2.7 sites are expected to be transitioned prior to December 31, 2018. To transition to Connect v3, leverage the materials available on Spark, including information on how the SDC can assist, how to explain the change to your client and how to use the new features. After your site is upgraded to Connect v3, remember to mark your v2.7 site as transitioned and purge the site (if the site is not subject to a document preservation hold). Large files (more than 250MB) will be hosted on the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Prior to enabling the large file functionality for your Connect V3 site, you must confirm that no terms have been agreed to with the client that would prohibit use of the cloud, including any terms within the engagement letter or an addendum that require on-premise data hosting or restrict us from sharing data with a 3rd party subcontractor. If your team has agreed to terms that would prohibit use of the cloud, you should not enable large file upload. All files smaller than 250MB continue to be hosted on-premise. Questions or concerns?

In addition, with the firmwide deployment of Rapid Engage wrapping up next week, the client acceptance process has been simplified. What you should know: No More MFAC! If a PwC Member Firm has Accepted the client they are now considered Accepted in the US. The Member Firm Acceptance Confirmation form (“MFAC”) will no longer be required. Additionally, you are no longer required to complete a Restricted Party Screening (“RPS”). All you need to do is be sure all of the equivalent RPS contacts are entered into Salesforce before you move your Opportunity to the Interact stage in Salesforce. The remaining steps will be taken care of for you. Tax contracting requirements remain unchanged The additional Terms and Conditions applicable to US Tax Services must be included in all engagement contracts or addendums thereto where PwC US is providing Services to another PwC network firm as a subcontractor. The additional provisions must be acknowledged by the PwC network firm’s client and returned to PwC US either by being contained in the originally executed engagement contract or signed as an addendum to the executed engagement contract. See Tax MFAC Toolkit link below. Automatic ADS The ADS system has been replaced and you no longer need to manually submit an Adverse Data Search request. Rather, simply enter your C-Suite contacts in Salesforce and mark them as such. Be sure you include all of the details you would have provided via the ADS form in the past. When the C-Suite contacts have been entered and your opportunity is moved to Interact or beyond, the information from Salesforce will be sent directly to the ADS team. Updated A&amp;C The Tax A&amp;C form has been updated to account for these new processes and to work with Rapid Engage.

Personal independence Ethics &amp; Compliance Jan. 2, 2019 If you are required to maintain independence, your immediate family’s (spouse/spouse equivalent and dependents’) relationships can impact your personal independence. Here are some examples: Aggregate credit card balances Do you know which financial institutions issue the credit cards you and your immediate family use? Check the back of each credit card to determine the issuer. If you’re a covered person to the issuer: Pay your bill on time without incurring late fees. Keep the aggregate carrying balance (of all cards held by you and your immediate family) with any issuer below $10,000. Watch this short clip about paying attention to those credit cards. Online payment accounts Remember Jasmine from this year’s Annual Independence, Ethics &amp; Compliance training? Ranga, Jasmine’s spouse equivalent, had a PayPal account she used for her fantasy football league and Jasmine was a covered person to PayPal. Certain websites and apps (such as PayPal, and Twinspires) act like digital wallets and hold money “on account.” If you are a covered person, you cannot maintain a balance in these accounts as they are considered “uninsured deposits.” It’s easy to start the discussion with your immediate family. Download and share this quick guide on “Personal Independence at Home.” Also, before providing any services, make sure you (and, by extension, your immediate family) are independent of the client. Remember: You cannot provide any audit services or 10 or more hours of non-audit services to a restricted entity if you have an investment in that entity or an affiliate. When providing services to an unrestricted entity, you cannot begin investing in that entity until six months after you have stopped providing services. You may keep investments previously held before working on the engagement, but you cannot sell or buy shares until the six month cooling off period passes. If you’re not sure of the restriction status or if you’re allowed to provide services, contact the Compliance Resource Center before providing any services. Learn more on the US Ethics and Compliance Personal Independence site or by calling the Compliance Resource Center at 1-877-PwC-Help (877-792-4357), option 5 in the US or 813-351-6491 outside the US.

With One Firm spirit and enhanced digital skills, the team delivered holiday cheer to more than 100 children in the community. For many years, PwC Dallas has proudly partnered with the Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center (DCAC), a local nonprofit whose mission is to improve the lives of abused children and provide leadership on child abuse issues. Last September, the Dallas office generously agreed to provide holiday gifts to 130 children as part of DCAC’s Holiday of Hope campaign, donating coats, pajamas, and other items on their wishlists. The campaign helped 2,200 of Dallas County’s most severely abused children during the holiday season. When the team received the children’s wish lists from DCAC in December, they realized the enormity of the project. Hundreds of gifts needed to be donated, organized and delivered -- in two weeks. The team needed a holiday miracle. One Firm spirit makes it happen “We had a lot of work to do with very little time,” said Associate Preston Davison. “We needed to purchase over 400 gifts. The gifts then needed to be sorted by family and child, and delivered to DCAC.” The office came together in true One Firm spirit to make the seemingly impossible task a success. Preston leveraged newly acquired digital skills to facilitate the process. “We started by creating an Amazon Wishlist, and then we leveraged UiPath and Alteryx workflows to track our purchases.” Thanks to the generosity and kindness of our PwC family, all of the items were purchased in just a matter of days. The Deals team alone sponsored 60 of the 130 children. And because kindness is contagious, a local Tax team was inspired to raise an additional $3,000 to sponsor 30 more children in need. “It was an honor to represent PwC when we delivered the gifts,” Preston said. “To see the tears and the smiling faces as we kept bringing in bag after bag of gifts was an incredible experience. I’m glad to have played a part in it.” The Dallas team plans to take part in the Holiday of Hope campaign again in 2019 -- just another example of how they continue spreading kindness to others. Note: Check out the latest episode of our Well, well, well podcast to hear more from our Dallas team on their Holiday of Hope experience. Also, keep sharing the kindness and add to our collective reach here.

Simply compose your email — but instead of hitting send, select the dropdown menu on the blue Send button. (If you have “Send and Archive” enabled, select the white send button.) Select “Schedule send” and choose the time and date from the pop-up menu. The time you select is local to your PC, so account for any difference in time zones. Taking it mobile To use the Schedule Send function on mobile, it only works in the Gmail app (which you can download from PwC’s App Store). To schedule an email on your mobile device, select the three dots next to the send icon and select “Schedule send.” Where do all the emails go? You’ll find scheduled emails in a folder called “Scheduled” (just under the “Sent” folder). From there, you can cancel or make adjustments to sending details. When working offline, it’s possible to schedule emails to be sent at a later time. However, emails will not be sent until you re-establish connection to the network. This means that if you are working offline on the plane, be sure to schedule emails to be sent after you reconnect to the network.

It’s time to rethink how you manage the data you work with daily. A great place to start is with healthy email management. These tips will help you take control of your email and make it work better for you. Avoid the temptation to use your inbox as your to-do list. Turn off email notifications, which distract from strategic tasks. Instead, designate certain times during the day to focus on email. Be strategic when reviewing your email. Try a quick triage system to delete, archive, take immediate action or “star” a message to handle later. By making decisions the first time you view a message, you’ll move through your email more efficiently. (Refresh on the records management and retention policy.) Set up labels for messages you need for a finite period (for instance, for a specific project). You’ll have quick access while you need it, without clogging up your inbox. And it will be easy to delete or transfer the entire group of emails to the appropriate system of record when the project is complete. (Watch the recent Connect &amp; Learn on mailbox labels.) Become an “inbox zero” hero. Clear out your inbox — and keep it clean. If you’ve got hundreds of emails piled up, try assigning them (temporarily) an “old email” label. You’ll still have easy access while you’re adjusting to your new inbox zero habit. Speaking of storage systems … don’t use email as a filing cabinet. Important info and attachments should be saved to shared environments like Google Drive (for collaboration) or systems of record (for project and client records). Make use of other communication channels like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter when appropriate and in compliance with business rules. Don’t be guilty of sending one-word emails (“Thanks!”), and do think twice before choosing “reply all.” More to know For more strategies to take control of your email, search “email” on Fathom Search. Visit Data remediation @ PwC for more on the steps we’re taking to sunset outdated data-storage systems (like Lotus Notes and shared drives), delete “redundant, obsolete and trivial” data (or “ROT,” like old emails), and put in place new guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle. #PwCUSIT Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/36471.html</url><pwc_title>Finance Transformation Integrated Solution For the Win at Microsoft</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-27 09:36:34</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:Advisory|source:Advisory</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-01-14 10:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>source:Advisory</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Finance Transformation Integrated Solution For the Win at Microsoft Finance Transformation Integrated Solution For the Win at Microsoft Advisory Jan. 14, 2019 We provided Microsoft with a comprehensive view of Transfer Pricing. Microsoft’s problem Microsoft operates globally in a complex regulatory environment. While undergoing a business model transformation, it faced challenges with Transfer Pricing—the process by which transferring prices of goods, intangibles, and services among enterprises under common ownership are booked, invoiced, and reconciled. Microsoft’s leaders looked for a documented process to increase efficiencies and lower risk, while eliminating dependency on individual “knowledge heroes” (B), create a simple view of transfer pricing through tight controls (X), and leverage a powerful platform that could scale with the needs of their global organization (T). We surprised the client with our One Firm approach. We created a Magic Moment... Our agile model was very different from what Microsoft expected, which offered a compelling alternative to standard third-party outsourcing. We brought our Tax, Advisory, Finance, and SAP capabilities, with risk and regulatory knowledge and digital enablement—powered by SAP—through our Finance Transformation Integrated Solution. The result? A robust solution from design, build, and deployment that delivered high quality results. We showed the client how to prevent a $1 billion loss. The solution and value we brought Microsoft now has a transparent Transfer Pricing solution that will: Enable detection of a calculation error that prevented a $1 billion loss. Create a single source of data and reduce manual processes that have shortened cycle time by 5 days and virtually eliminate bottlenecks. Enable clear roadmaps with replicability and reduce audit risks. Provide a future state that will meet changing statutory requirements more quickly and support organizational change.

A new way to pay our Talent Exchange talent Show them the money! A new way to pay our Talent Exchange talent Advisory May 30, 2019 In June, we’re launching new functionality in Talent Exchange that will provide you more flexibility in structuring agreements with independent talent. You’ll have the option to offer talent daily and weekly rates, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Today, we're spotlighting Fixed Price. Fixed Price roles allow you to award work based on a total price. When creating the role, you include a number of milestones and / or deliverables with associated descriptions and amounts. Talent can then bid on each item during a pricing event and accept an offer based on the total aggregate price. Take a look at the key benefits and considerations below to learn more! Key Benefits For PwC For Talent Some projects are better suited to paying by milestone/deliverable versus time to complete Know up-front how much a project will cost Financial risk shifts to talent Experienced talent often prefer to structure fixed price arrangements versus distilling their work to an hourly rate Know up-front how much a role will pay and greater insight into what is required to successfully deliver the role Key Considerations As we are asking talent to price all work during a pricing event or before the start of a project, the engagement team must have a conversation with talent regarding the specific details for each milestone or deliverable and fully explain what constitutes successful delivery. (Talent have to acknowledge this conversation as well before participating in a pricing event or accepting an offer.) All delivery details must be captured in a SOW at the project start any modifications to milestones or deliverables must be reflected in the SOW prior to the team updating Talent Exchange. Talent Exchange is NOT the system of record. Engagement Leaders will need to approve offers before they are sent to talent, given the potential magnitude of fixed price amounts. Costs will appear on WIPs as expense disbursements versus hours. If you’ve followed along so far, great work! Submit a way in which you think this new functionality can be used on your project for a chance to win a $50 Amazon gift card. And keep an eye out for other announcements preceding our launch.

Follow 5 steps to analyze per Wait…are these Tax services permissible? Follow 5 steps to analyze permissibility of services One Firm Risk Organization May 23, 2019 Before proposing on or providing services to a restricted client, engagement teams must consider the permissibility of those services, taking into consideration the current restriction status of the client in CES (i.e., SEC, AICPA and/or GIP). In order to help engagement teams assess the permissibility of services, the Statements of Permitted Services ("SOPS") and US Independence Policy ("USIP") were drafted. The SOPS and USIP should be used to determine how to apply PwC’s Independence policies regarding non-audit services to be provided to restricted clients and related entities. In general, an Independence analysis utilizing the SOPS and USIP involves an evaluation of the Independence threats that may arise with respect to a particular service offering and related safeguards that, if implemented, may eliminate or reduce such threats to an acceptable level. All SOPS follow a standard format: Section 1: What this SOPS Covers – describes the services or issues covered in the specific SOPS; Section 2: Application of Global Independence Policy (“GIP”) – provides guidance on what is/is not permitted and/or what is permitted with safeguards for GIP restricted clients; Section 3: Nature of the Independence Threat – provides an analysis of the main threats to PwC’s audit Independence that may arise from the services or issues covered by the SOPS; Section 4: Safeguards – provides guidance as to safeguards that may be applied generally or in specific circumstances to mitigate identified risks to Independence; and Section 5: Supplemental Guidance for SEC-Restricted Entities – provides guidance for SEC restricted clients that is additional to, or different from, the GIP requirements discussed in Section 2 and which must be followed when providing services to SEC restricted clients. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP provide guidance for SEC and AICPA restricted clients that is additional to, and occasionally different from, the guidance contained in the SOPS. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP should be reviewed in connection with the SOPS and followed when providing services to SEC and/or AICPA restricted clients. The following steps provide high-level guidelines on how to use the SOPS and USIP to perform an Independence analysis: Action 1: Confirm that you have identified the appropriate SOPS for the proposed services (a user-friendly SOPS chart has been created and can be used as a starting point in any Independence analysis). Action 2: If providing services to a SEC restricted client, start with Section 5 of the SOPS and Section 7200 of USIP to establish whether the proposed services are permissible per SEC guidelines. If not permissible, you will need to reconsider/restructure the service offering as SEC Independence rules do not permit the implementation of safeguards to eliminate or reduce threats to an acceptable level when providing services to a SEC restricted client. Action 3: If the services are permissible with respect to a SEC restricted client or if the client is AICPA and/or GIP restricted (only), you must verify that the services are permissible per Section 7400 of USIP (for AICPA restricted clients) and/or Section 2 of the SOPS (for GIP restricted clients). Action 4: If the services are permissible, determine the nature of the Independence threats as described in Section 3 of the SOPS and the corresponding safeguards to be applied as described in Section 4 of the SOPS. Action 5: Once the Independence analysis has been documented, engagement teams must include the analysis along with the "Threats and Safeguards Analysis Form" in the "Relevant Policy and Threats and Safeguards" section of the AFS (Authorisation For Services form) for approval by the CES Responsible Partner (and the U.S. AFS Review team, where required). For additional information regarding permissibility, please visit the Independence microsite or contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

As we near the firmwide holiday shutdown and wrap up the calendar year, it’s a good time to pause, reflect and take stock of your progression and performance, as well as your path forward. To help you, here’s a quick checklist: ✔ Development Team: Have you connected with your Development Team? It’s important to have regular check-ins so they can support your career develop and progression. Also, you have until Jan. 1, 2019, to earn Well-Being Rewards for meeting with your Relationship Leader, Career Coach or Connectivity Partner (as applicable). ✔ Snapshots: You should have at least two, acknowledged Snapshots, which capture your progression against the PwC Professional framework. Remember: Aim to have at least 80% of your hours covered at all times. Need help writing a performance differentiator - check this out. ✔ Career Roundtable: It’s not too early to think about Career Roundtable and what actions you can take to show your contributions and impact. Make sure you meet with your relationship leader to discuss opportunities that demonstrate your impact. ✔ Promotion requirements: If you’re eligible for promotion this year, it’s never too early to familiarize yourself with these promotion requirements. If promoted to manager, you’ll need to comply with independence requirements -- the earlier you start, the easier the transition will be! Need more info?

Are you contributing to your Health Savings Account (HSA)? You can start, increase or decrease HSA contributions at any time at Benefits Express Online. And if you’re enrolled in the High or Middle Deductible Plan, PwC puts money in your HSA each pay day. Here are five reasons you should save as much as you can in your HSA. 1. You get triple tax savings. Contributions to your HSA are not taxed. Funds in your HSA grow tax-free. Withdrawals for qualified health care expenses are also tax-free. 2. You don’t lose what you don’t spend. There’s no "use it or lose it" rule for funds in your HSA. Any money you don’t use by the end of the year rolls over to the next year -- and even into retirement. So, you don't have to know what kind of health care expenses you'll incur in order to contribute to an HSA. 3. You HSA dollars earn interest and potentially investment returns. Your HSA cash balance earns interest based on the applicable rate for your balance. Plus, you’re eligible to invest any portion of your HSA balance in excess of $1,000 in available mutual fund options. These options comply with PwC's independence requirements and you don’t need to enter these investments through the Independence Checkpoint system. 4. You can use your HSA for anyone in your family. Use HSA dollars to pay for the qualified medical expenses for anyone you claim on your taxes, even if they’re not enrolled in your medical plan. 5. You can take it with you! Your HSA is portable. It goes with you -- even if you leave PwC. Learn more and earn Well-Being Rewards For more information about HSAs and the benefits of maximizing your contributions, view the online course Using Your Health Savings Account Effectively. When you do, you earn 500 points in the Well-Being Rewards Program.* (Earn up to 1,000 points per quarter for completing online financial well-being courses.

In less than two weeks since launch, over 6,600 Real-time recognition awards have been sent to say “thank you”! Let’s keep the momentum going and make in-the-moment gratitude part of our daily routine. Recognizing others fuels our emotional well-being and aligns with Be well, work well, a vital component of Your Tomorrow. Access Real-time recognition today via myKcurve, the “PwC External Links” worklet in Workday, and in PwC’s App Store via the Globoforce mobile app. As with any new program or tool, Real-time recognition comes with a learning curve, so here are a few quick tips: Budget (if eligible): If you have been allocated an annual budget by your leadership team, half of it was loaded into the system on Sept. 28. The other half will be loaded in January 2019, but you cannot borrow against that budget to use during this first period. Spending balance: This can be seen via PC (not yet in the app) during the recognition process. After clicking “Recognize,” search for the colleague you wish to award, then select the award reason. You will see the screen shown below: Best practice for coaches: Add your coachees to your work circle, which is based on your supervisory organization family in Workday. This allows you to easily track their recognition events. On the Recognition home page, scroll down to activity and click "edit" next to "My work circle" to add people. To delete someone from your work circle, click “x” next to their name. Recognition activity feed: If you choose the “shared” privacy setting, your award reason and message will appear on the Recognition activity feed. Only the award recipient will know if the award is monetary or non-monetary. Note: Do not share client names, confidential information or any comments outside of our Code of Conduct in your recognition message or if you congratulate others in the Recognition activity feed. If client names are included, the administrators will make the award private. Have additional questions? Visit the Real-time recognition site. Stay tuned… We’ll announce the winners of our launch contest soon! Need technical support? Our vendor, Globoforce, offers 24/7 customer service phone support. Simply click the Contact Us button in the top right of any page within the Real-time recognition platform. A live representative will assist you with any functionality, award or redemption-related issues.

We pay attention to how we entertain our own people, too. Our partners have these policies in place to help us protect our brand and the firm by keeping our expenses accurate and transparent. But you might be surprised when our new system requires compliance by asking for more details than in the past. First, make sure you know the basics. Watch SAP Concur’s 90-second video tutorial on adding attendees to a business meal: Expense system pro tips: Speed up entering attendees for group meals and entertainment Don’t type the same names over (and over) again. With our integrated systems and a few shortcuts, the details you need are no further than a search away: If your group meals frequently include the same people, create a group -- and quickly populate the details for these events in the future. Client information is fed into our expense system from Salesforce, so a quick search by either the client’s name or company will populate their details. And if the client isn’t already listed in the expense system, enter just the first and last name, title and organization -- and consider that your reminder to get them added to Salesforce! If you’re expensing a large group meal, but it’s just PwC employees, check out this shortcut. As long as you input the correct total number of attendees you don’t have to worry about providing detailed information for more than six PwC people. More to know Want more pro tips?

The results reflect continued improvement in certain areas as a result of everyone’s collective efforts; however, the total number of audits addressed in the report reflects an increase of two compared to the prior year. We can be pleased with the areas of improvement, but our overall results reflect the need to maintain a priority focus on driving further improvements in audit quality. The PCAOB oversees auditors of public companies, and in doing so annually inspects our audit performance and related quality controls. When the PCAOB issues a report on a firm, it’s in two parts: Part I is posted to the PCAOB’s website, and Part II is shared with the inspected firm and focuses on their system of quality control. The PCAOB has now posted Part I of our 2017 inspection report on its website. If you have any questions about our report, or need assistance in discussing it with your clients, please reach out to your local partner leader, Brian Richson (973-236-5615) or Brian Croteau (973-236-4799).

For many, the question of what happens to that business after the owner retires is fraught with challenges. Charlie Carr and Belinda Sneddon, Managing Directors in PwC's US Family Enterprise Advisory Services group, share their insights from working with family business owners on continuity and succession planning challenges. After working hard to establish their businesses, how well are family business owners planning to preserve their wealth and legacy for future generations? Belinda: There is so much focus on establishing and growing the business that owners often are not thinking about continuity planning. It’s interesting because the characteristics that make them so good at building their business may be the same ones that make it so hard for them to bring others into the decision making and management processes. This is an area where family business owners could benefit from guidance around the need for appropriate planning, communication, and execution. Charlie: Unfortunately, we see many first generation family members who don't have answers for the next generation — and don't want to discuss it. This may be the worst possible response, as they need to be more strategic so they can identify shortcomings and develop ways to address them. What are some of the biggest issues related to continuity and succession planning? Charlie: First generation businesses are often run by a controlling owner. In the second and third generations, siblings or cousins may need to work together. Each family member has different skills, interests, and goals. While some may be competing to run the company, others might be uninvolved and more concerned about distribution levels. So families need to balance these different interests. Belinda: Communicating these plans is something that many families find challenging. Where communication is missing or weak, the resulting lack of transparency can cause rifts in the family and problems for the business. Even where communication is strong, it is important not to assume awareness equates to acceptance/buy-in. Charlie: At the end of the day, families need to have a governance model that evolves as they move across generations because the model that worked for the prior generation may not work for the next one. What steps do you recommend families take to set up for long-term success? Charlie: During the upcoming Continuity and Succession Planning webinar on September 19th, Belinda and I will talk about three key steps that family business should take related to strategy, communication, and execution. We'll discuss why each step is important and share examples of the pitfalls we’ve seen families encounter at each step. Attend, and invite your clients to attend, the Continuity and Succession Planning webinar sponsored by PwC and Family Business Magazine on Wednesday, September 19 from 2 pm - 3 pm ET.

To watch the replay, go to the PwC webcast portal and select “Tax CRT &amp; Comp webcast” under April 24. A few highlights and reminders As Tim Ryan recently communicated and as Roy mentioned in our Tax Town Hall, if our One Firm results stay on track (and we believe they will), we’ll increase the annual performance bonus pools up to an additional 10% so we have additional dollars to recognize our people for their individual contributions and impact. The final decision will be made once we complete the review of the financial results, so let’s make every effort to finish the FY strong. Note: This does not mean that individual bonuses will increase by 10%. It means your leaders will potentially have a larger pool of funds that will be allocated based upon business needs. As an example, it could be allocated by market, business unit and/or impact. To prepare for your Career Roundtable discussion, review your Snapshots to assess how you are progressing along the PwC Professional framework, as well as the impact you had for the year, which come through the differentiators. For promotion candidates, be aware of the promotion requirements for your level and team and set aside time now to meet the various deadlines. Review key metrics via myMetrics as well as your TalentLink profile/schedule. (For our manager promotion candidates, Talentlink is where we look for your logged credentials.) Plan ahead! Have regular touch points with you career coach and RP to discuss your career goals, your deployment interests, learning needs, your metrics, Snapshots, as well as progression and development throughout the year. ...and remember, we continue to invest in you!

Our goal is to help you and your teams better understand how we’re moving toward Your Tomorrow with a continued focus on the quality of our execution. If you were unable to attend the webcast, you can watch the replay here -- and read this summary to see what we covered and access helpful resources: For those who are heading into busy season, it’s important to remember that quality is our number one priority and foundational to all we want to accomplish in our strategy. For easy reference, we’ve put together this slide with links to recent Audit Advisors that may be helpful for your engagements. Our Digital Accelerators may have jumpstarted our progress, but we all have the opportunity and obligation to use our new digital skills and look for ways to simplify, standardize and automate processes as appropriate. With the launch of Digital Lab last week, I encourage all of you to use it. Check out what’s already on there, and submit your own automations. Digital upskilling is a process -- setting aside a little time each week will add up. Additional upskilling resources can be found in the Digital Hub, including access to the four Digital Quests you’ll need to complete by the end FY19 to earn your Digital Acumen Knowledge Badge. Your first Digital Quest is due on December 31. Use our tools &amp; technology, like Engagement Center and My Independence Assessment, on your engagements, and leverage relevant TEA resources. They can help you continue to enhance quality and gain process efficiencies at the same time. With the recent transition to Workday, we’ve made a few changes to how we’re asking you to document CPA and non-CPA credentials. You can find your specific requirements and additional information here. Updates and reminders for the next few months are summarized here. And as we head into busy season I have two asks: 1.) Remember to stay committed to your Be well, work well plans -- encourage and support the goals of every member of your team; and 2.) continue to practice real-time development by scheduling time to connect with your coach -- ask for feedback! Thank you for all that you do, and have a Happy Thanksgiving!

As part of our Rewards Strategy, eligible newly promoted client service senior managers and IFS directors are awarded a four-week sabbatical -- a chance to unwind, recharge and truly focus on their well-being through Be well, work well -- a key component of Your Tomorrow. In 2012, Lanie Potgieter left her home of Cape Town, South Africa for a short-term international tour in New York City. Little did she know, the move would become permanent — and was the start of an incredible journey of personal growth. “Being a senior associate in PwC’s New York City office (at the time) was both a thrill and challenge,” Lanie admits. “Although I was working long hours and feeling a little homesick, the experience provided a new perspective on well-being.” To keep up with the fast-pace of the Big Apple, Lanie recognized the importance of energy renewal. With the encouragement of her partner and mentor John Gottfried, she decided to invest more time in well-being and find balance by trying yoga. “Being on the yoga mat allows me to feel fully present and melts away my stress,” said Lanie. “I learned how to balance assertiveness and softness and quickly began to see how that balance was having a positive effect on my relationships and approach to work.” Yoga had such a profound effect on Lanie that she decided to become an instructor to help others discover the many health benefits of yoga and mindfulness. In November 2018, she used her career milestone sabbatical to attend an intensive yoga training program in Bali. “I researched many teacher training programs and ultimately decided to travel far from home,” she says. “I wanted to completely disconnect and immerse myself in the experience. The 24-day program was incredible!” Although yoga works for Lanie, she recognizes it may not be for everyone. She advises people to Be well, work well by finding what they enjoy doing to re-energize and sticking with it. “Not every yoga practice is easy for me. Some days are better than others. But I always return to my mat, because I know in the end, it’s going to make me feel great and help me be my best self.” Visit our Rewards Strategy site to learn more about milestone sabbaticals and PwC's Career Milestone program.

"After joining PwC in 2014, and relocating from Connecticut to Chicago, I was living large, literally, enjoying everything city life had to offer, including dining out every night in fancy restaurants," he said. But the good times left their mark when Matthew stepped on that scale and reality set in. "I thought it must be defective,” he said. “I was 40 pounds over what I thought I weighed.” That startling moment propelled him to make a complete lifestyle change. He joined a gym, hired a personal trainer, and began eating healthier and tracking his food every day. It didn’t take long to start seeing results. "I was encouraged by my progress and stayed on course, including bringing healthy snacks and lunches to work, limiting restaurant meals and continuing these good habits even when traveling for work," Matthew said. His loss, his gain Inevitably, the scale went down, and down. "I lost a total of 90 pounds over the span of about three years," he said. He was even featured in his gym's "Transformation Tuesday" promotional campaign. Matthew also realized he was already living the principles of Be well, work well in many ways, and began following the suggestions outlined in the Habit Bank to stay energized. "I'm glad the firm is committed to well-being; it’s so important to our success and our people," he said. He focuses on mental and spiritual energy through yoga, reading and being more aware of his spirituality in general. Matthew's team is supportive of his dramatic journey, and they all enjoy sharing tips. "We have an Instagram account for The habit challenge. We call ourselves “Energizin’ is a Habit, Get Like Me,’” he said. They have committed to "stepping away from the screen" and "hydrating your mind." "My team pushes me to continue to be a champion of living a healthy lifestyle," he said. Matthew also takes advantage of the Well-Being Rewards program by logging his gym time, nutritionist visits, yearly physicals and more -- banking his rewards all year. "I use them to get my wife an extra Christmas present," he said. He's also a member of PwC Chicago’s Health and Wellness Committee, which promotes many of the practices of The habit challenge. For those struggling with weight issues, Matthew has a message: "It can be done -- I am proof. Despite the hours, client dinners, happy hours and travel, it’s still possible to live a healthy lifestyle and meet the demands of our clients. Good habits take time to take hold; don't get discouraged. And please contact me if I can help." Oh, and pizza and ice cream are not off limits. "I still indulge,” Matthew said. "But it's the exception now, not the rule." Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know!

Avoid buyer’s remorse Ethics &amp; Compliance March 27, 2019 Consider this scenario: You want to impress your client with a new presentation tool. You find the perfect tool online and it's only $20 a month! You grab your AMEX*, agree to the terms, and you're done. Would you have made this purchase if you knew this tool sends confidential client data that is in your presentation back to the software company? Or that the company’s owner is allegedly accused of patent infringement and trade-secret theft? Oh, and you missed the part that the version you purchased is only for personal use, not for business use. Sounds scary, right? It should. Certain suppliers present higher risk to the firm, and it is critical that we perform the proper due diligence before we contract with such suppliers. The Supplier Risk Management Program, part of the Procurement process, helps you proactively identify and mitigate risks -- like the ones identified in the scenario above. What you should do when engaging a supplier Make sure you submit your request to Procurement through Request It if your supplier request meets any one of the following conditions: The supplier may have access to, process or host client or firm information. The contract or purchase value may be greater than or equal to $50,000 ($10,000 for contract or purchases initiated in Mexico). The software may be used by, with or resold to clients (including being incorporated into client deliverables or market facing offerings). Be sure to reference the “When to Engage Procurement” section of the Procurement policy as soon as you think you might need a supplier as the policy may be updated throughout the year. *Purchasing software or IT services using a corporate AMEX credit card is prohibited by the firm. Be sure to submit requests for software not available in Software Installer or Software Center by submitting a request using the IT Request Form.

Get to know our Drafting your next engagement letter just got easier. Get to know our newest tool: Create One Firm Risk Organization July 30, 2018 Create, our engagement letter creation system, is now available for all lines of service. Create makes drafting engagement letters, statements of work and other deliverables simpler, using a questionnaire structure to pull in the right firm-approved language. Built on the Exari platform, the system is easy to use and eliminates the need to edit our previous Word-based templates. We piloted Create across the firm and the feedback has been resoundingly positive. Along with DocuSign ,the electronic signature platform that also launches firmwide today, the shift underscores our firmwide strategy to simplify our internal process as well as become digital in all that we do as we improve the experience for our clients in these key contracting interactions. Create can help you by: Saving time and cost in preparing and reviewing documents -- giving you time back in your day Enhancing accuracy and quality -- helping you produce the right document in the right format at the start of the process Lowering risk by reducing the potential for manual errors Simplifying reviews by tracking and displaying any manual changes made to the template language When and how can I start using Create? Create is now available for all US lines of service. The tool will be available for Mexico engagement letters, statements of work and some deliverables later this fiscal year. Our Create site has all the materials you’ll need to get started, including FAQs, demo videos and quick reference guides for Assurance and Advisory users. Tax users will continue to access “Create for Tax” through Engagement Center, or from the OFRO Tax (formerly Tax Q&amp;RM) Engagement Letters microsite. How does Create work? Our Create team combed through all the language in existing Word templates, including underlying footnotes, to build a contracting platform that’s easier to use and maintain. All of those pesky footnotes that required reading and editing have been transformed into questions in the system that you answer with the click of a button. No more wording changes, wrestling with footnotes, or changing fonts and colors. To put that effort in perspective: For Assurance alone, the Create team reviewed each of the 60+ Assurance templates available in US Template Manager -- more than 5,000 paragraphs of text. We standardized the language Create will use to build your draft to fewer than 400 paragraphs. All data entered in Create can also be data-mined by the new One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO), ASM&amp;T and OGC for better risk management decisions, and all letters are stored centrally for easy access. Create for Tax currently integrates with DMS when used with Engagement Center. Executed tax letters from clients are automatically filed to DMS as they are returned. Integration with Aura is also planned to allow Assurance to upload completed letters to the EGAs seamlessly. Additional capabilities include: Document access is automatically set using the underlying engagement acceptance forms contained in the A&amp;C system. Partners and Managers on the EAFs are granted rights to their own client content. For Assurance engagements, access is also guided by Aura rights. Additional drafters can be added manually, giving you the flexibility to add team members directly to a document, without impacting A&amp;C or Aura. For staff who transition to other engagements, real-time adjustments will carry through to the system, automatically adjusting their access. Create will store seven years of content in the system, in accordance with our data retention policy. What’s next for Create? The team is already at work to bring other streamlined documentation onto Create for late 2018, including opinions, memos, SEC services documents, comfort letters and more. Create is also built for integration with other new technologies the firm is rolling out to simplify the client acceptance and engagement startup processes. Coming later this summer, the new Rapid Engage tool will help you get from opportunity identification to WBS code release faster. And Create will be integrated with DocuSign, our new electronic document signing system in late 2018. Have feedback or ideas for enhancing Create? Provide them here for consideration.

She taught herself Alteryx and developed a solution that’s now saving hundreds of hours of work and opening up the door to new client opportunities. Here’s more from Lauren: PwC Inside: Tell us a bit about the challenge your team was facing. Lauren Bauer: We knew there had to be a way to easily compare the publicly available data on benefits and pension plans that all companies file with the Department of Labor through a Form 5500. The information was out there, but no one had organized it or figured out an automated way to analyze it that would offer insights to current and potential clients. How did you approach it and what results have you seen? We had an idea that there might be a way to use technology to streamline the process, and I was excited to explore it more. With guidance from our resident Alteryx “ninja” Ming Fang, I worked in my spare time to build my knowledge of Alteryx and Tableau, and designed a tool that would allow us to compare companies’ data. My team, and my manager in particular, trusted me to teach them the new technology as we went along -- even as they were reviewing my work. They trusted me to guide them, even though I was the most junior person on the team. Now, work that would have taken hundreds of hours can now be done in a few minutes, allowing our team to focus on the analysis. We’re starting to identify companies that would benefit from working with us, and, as a result, already have two wins under our belt. What inspires you to make an impact on your team and PwC more broadly? Being new to the firm, I was excited to bring something to the table for my team. I love learning new things and exploring new tools -- before this project, I didn’t know what a Form 5500 was! I take pride in solving problems. Internally, this meant figuring out how we can create and use better tools and then externally, for our clients, how we can use public data to solve a problem. I feel that, in general, the firm can learn a lot by looking to new people who don’t know how things were done before. These are the people who have a fresh perspective on how to approach challenges, leading to new ways of doing things that are more efficient for everyone. To learn more about Lauren’s winning Alteryx / Tableau solution and how you could apply it to your engagement, contact Lauren, Kristin Harel or Michael Cardillo. In support of Your Tomorrow, the Tax practice is accelerating the journey to digitize work, enabling staff at all levels to focus on developing critical digital, tax technical and consultative skills and spend more high-value time with clients. Lauren’s successful use of technology to dramatically streamline work for her engagement embodies the purpose of this strategy, known as Digitizing Tax: Project 5 Million. To support the strategy, Tax has created an interactive community that houses our colleagues’ data workflows, visualizations and BOTS in a single, easily accessible location. The community will facilitate seamless collaboration among users. Stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks about this community -- and in the meantime, get a head start by taking the on-demand self-service analytics trainings, available here on Digital Hub. Our purpose as a firm is to build trust in society and solve important problems. Those problems can be large or small -- sometimes all it takes is a fresh pair of eyes and a different approach to find the one that you’ll solve. No matter what our role, we all have opportunities to go above and beyond to deliver our work and find meaning in what we do every day. How does our purpose resonate with you?

Such engagements include the following: Tax provision preparation or review Accounting for uncertain tax positions Tax accounting performance improvement GHRS Pension/OPEB valuation, stock-based compensation accounting or deferred tax related services (ASC 712, 715, 718 and/or 740). Because of the risk profile of such engagements, tax engagement teams should be aware of the risk management protocols to help teams mitigate the risks on these engagements. One such protocol requires that all tax accounting service engagements for non-audit clients be approved by a TAS Market Leader or a GHRS Accounting Services Leader. In addition, tax accounting service engagements that have been designated as high risk require OFRO Tax approval and the approval and active involvement of a Concurring Partner (“CP”) with tax accounting experience. Effective 11/7/2018, all non-restricted (C2) Tax provision review/preparation engagements are required to be restricted in DMS (see the Policy: Confidentiality and DMS access). All approvals should be obtained during the engagement acceptance process and prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. Engagement teams should select the characteristics that apply to the engagement when completing the A&amp;C engagement acceptance assessment to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained during the Engagement Acceptance process. When providing tax accounting services for non-audit clients, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check restriction in Salesforce (or Central Entity Service (“CES”)) to determine if client is a non-audit client If a non-audit client, initiate the engagement acceptance assessment in A&amp;C Obtain TAS/GHRS leader approval and, if applicable, OFRO Tax and CP approvals Execute engagement contract Begin work For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that a different approval process applies to engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients. Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

At PwC, we are using this time to celebrate the contributions of our LGBT+ community, reinforce our commitment to our LGBT+ colleagues and create a sense of belonging for all. We are starting the month with the introduction of a new global brand for our LGBT+ efforts — Shine. Shine represents our commitment to spotlighting and supporting our LGBT+ colleagues and the issues facing their community, while also uniting our LGBT+ community around the globe with one name. “Taking inspiration from the bright shining colors in a rainbow, an iconic LGBT+ symbol, this new name signifies how our people shine a light on the important issues that impact the LGBT+ community — and how they bring their authentic selves to work every day. By working to build trust in society, making our workplace and culture stronger, and creating brighter opportunities, PwC’s LGBT+ community helps each and every one of PwC’s people truly shine,” said Jeff Bharkhda, US Shine partner champion. We’ll mark Pride month in a number of ways, including supporting a team of 100 riders and roadies from around the globe in the AIDS Lifecycle ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The PwC team has raised more than $1 million to support AIDS research, making us the top corporate team fundraiser for three years in a row. At the end of the month, more than 160 delegates of Shine from across the globe will gather in New York City for our first-ever Global LGBT+ Summit. During the program, delegates will discuss issues affecting the firm and the LGBT+ community at large, hear from internal and external speakers who will share their experiences and insights, and discuss best practices that can be applied in their day-to-day interactions.

Through this program, you simply send a weekly email and meet once a month to empower a student to graduate high school and pursue their college aspirations. The hours you contribute to this organization count toward PwC’s Access Your Potential commitment. For more information, please attend one of our information sessions this summer: July iMentor Information Session Date: Wednesday, July 24, 2019 Time: 12:30pm to 1:30pm Location: 300 Madison – 22302 Lincoln Center Sign up to attend the July iMentor information session August iMentor Information Session Date: Wednesday, August 21, 2019 Time: 12:30pm to 1:30pm Location: 300 Madison – 22302 Lincoln Center Sign up to attend the August iMentor information session What is the program time commitment? The iMentor model provides flexibility to enable their mentors to volunteer even with a busy work schedule. Getting involved with iMentor is a great way to do something outside of client service that is truly impactful. 1.) Weekly email communication (3 times a month) - iMentor will provide a weekly writing prompt / topic for each Mentor and student to exchange to promote targeted, in-depth discussions addressing college readiness and success. 2.) Monthly in person meetings (once a month) - Mentors and students get together for in-person meetings, lasting two hours. The events and locations for these in-person meetings are all arranged by iMentor. All that is required of you as a Mentor is to attend. Questions about iMentor or looking to volunteer? The PwC champions for the iMentor program are Tamir, Zinger, Conor Queenan and Sean Hill. If you are interested in volunteering or learning more about iMentor please reach out to Tamir, Conor or Sean.

We hope you’ll take full advantage of this opportunity to disconnect from your work technology. IT Customer Support is still here to help if you need it. While local IT Customer Support is closed, you can use our other support options or visit PwC’s new service hub. It's an easy way to search for answers to your question, place orders, make support requests, resolve issues and find support options for IT, human capital, finance and other internal support services. Submit your time and expenses by June 29 to avoid delinquency notices, errors or expense/AmEx issues. Submit any lingering invoices to avoid delays in payment. Add this calendar reminder to double-check you’ve cleared your AmEx buffer and submitted all expenses in the legacy Mobile Expense system before we switch to the new expense system on July 17. Set your out-of-office notification. (Tip: Download the updated Out of Office app from PwC’s App Store … setting up your out-of-office alerts has never been so easy!) Enable call forwarding if you expect to receive critical calls. Traveling abroad? Your phone already has international roaming -- please use it responsibly. Don’t forget your passwords. But if you do, you can easily reset them. Replicate Aura data to avoid data loss or replication issues. Power down your PC. Not only is it time to check out, but when you turn it on, the proper updates will automatically install -- and you can hit the ground running when you come back to work. Clear your workspace. Put away files, and secure or take your laptop home.

HQ is the Firm's new intranet platform, replacing myKcurve, PwC's legacy intranet of more than 10 years. This new site, powered by Adobe Experience Manager, further drives our Your Tomorrow strategy by serving as a modern, personalized portal that's your front door to firmwide and LoS news, tools and resources. PwC HQ is designed to give you easier access to the information you need to work, day in and day out. The user-friendly interface thoughtfully streamlines navigation and content so that you have on-demand access to the top apps and sites that you use on a daily basis. Fun fact: the name HQ (an abbreviation for headquarters) was chosen by our partners and staff back in January when we launched a survey to choose the name for our new intranet. Over 6,400 of you voted on the first piece of bringing this new site to life! For more information, refer to the About HQ page. What are some of the key features of HQ? The first release of HQ is called an “MVP - Minimum Viable Product” launch, which means that this is just the beginning and HQ will continue to be enhanced in the coming months. The following features are currently included: New look and feel, mobile-friendly user experience Streamlined navigation (fewer navigation items, more intuitive ways to get to underlying content, customizable Quick Links) Personalization (content across the site is targeted according to your personal attributes e.g. LoS, Sector, location) Key Dates (see upcoming firmwide events and add them to your Google calendar with one click) Stay tuned for more information on future enhancements. What will be included in future releases? Our HQ roadmap will continue to be refined and grow in the coming months. Right now, key items for our product roadmap include: Integrate predictive data and insights from the new myMetrics; Astro alignment Integrate key sites and systems into HQ search (align with enterprise search/Fathom on the front end) Expand personalization/preferences and analytics Mexico portal migration (via Spark) Partner Portal evaluation and approach Email/newsletter solution alignment and integration Collaboration platform alignment Is myKcurve going away? The front-end staff experience of myKcurve will no longer be available. However, the partner portal, also on Kcurve, will not be turned off in June and will be available to partners through personalized navigation. Is HQ available on mobile? The first release is "mobile-responsive." Post MVP, we will move towards "mobile-native," or an experience that can be fully realized in app format (with app notifications). Will HQ have social and/or collaboration functionality? You will have the ability to share content from HQ with other partners and staff. More community functionality (commenting and liking, for example) will be introduced in future releases of HQ. The US firm is currently exploring options for firmwide collaboration tools. Once that decision has been made, the approved solution for collaboration may be integrated into the HQ experience. Is HQ replacing Spark? No, HQ is not replacing Spark. The firm is in the process of reviewing collaboration and self-service web creation tools that will support the future demands of our Your Tomorrow agenda, but for now, we will still use Spark. With that said, there is content on Spark that is integral to our new digital workplace experience -- content that represents our firm strategy, structure and values -- that we will evaluate and update for potential migration onto HQ. Is HQ available in Mexico? The Mexico portal experience will remain on Spark in the near-term but we are looking to migrate it to HQ in FY20. Is HQ available to contractors or employees outside the US? Our contractor and PwC global employees will not have the personalization features in HQ that are available to our US employees (as these are pulled from Workday), but they will be able to view the content. How can I personalize my HQ experience? On Day 1, you can enhance your HQ experience by populating your Quick Links and ensuring that your personalization settings are properly set. The personal attributes (according to Workday) that will inform the content that you see in your homepage news feed and suggested Quick Links are: line of service, sector/subsector and location. You can see the attributes from your Workday profile by clicking the person link in the top right corner of your HQ screen. How can I find information outside of my personalized areas? If you are looking for content that isn’t personalized to you (e.g., you’re in Advisory and looking for information or news from Assurance), use Search and then filter by any LoS. In the future, we will be adding additional personalization features and you will also have the ability to subscribe to news from other lines of service, sectors and locations. How can I customize my Quick Links? Quick Links are designed to give you one-click access to the sites and systems you frequent most (see visual here). You have ten Quick Links available in your left hand navigation. Four of those ten Quick Links have been pre-populated based on your role at the firm, e.g., Tax Source for a Tax employee, or Consulting Source for an Advisory employee. All Quick Links can be edited, including the ones that are pre-populated. Staff can choose Quick Links by selecting the HQ Link Index, which will open an index of ~400 sites and systems that staff frequent most. You can add or remove a Quick Link by selecting the + or - button to the right of the link in the Link Index. How can I find my LoS/function information? You will see personalized news appear on the HQ homepage, specific to your LoS, sector and location. LoS communications and change teams will continue to create and publish content. In addition, you can find the LOS homepages in the “Our Clients and Business” navigation menu and these pages will link out to other areas. How can I provide feedback on HQ? Visit the HQ feedback community to share your ideas for product enhancements, see what others have suggested and vote on the ideas you’d like to see come to life. Your participation in this feedback tool will help the HQ team identify and prioritize enhancements to the site’s user experience, influencing the site’s user experience and product roadmap. How can I search on HQ? HQ makes it easier to access the information you need to deliver for our clients and our firm, and do so more efficiently. The HQ search functionality is a simplified experience that provides a single search bar, instead of the toggle search functionality available previously on myKcurve. Therefore, HQ search results will only display content (i.e., pages, microsites) and news (firmwide and LoS) that are native to HQ and will not surface all results from the sources that could be found on the myKcurve search bar (e.g., Fathom, A&amp;A, Tax Source). Over time, HQ search will become more robust as we integrate with other platforms. Please stay tuned for updates on the timing of these, and other, HQ enhancements. In the meantime, access to individual search repositories, including Fathom, A&amp;A and Tax Source, can be added as Quick Links or found in the Link Index. Will I be able to set reminders of my own on HQ? Yes, you can add certain firmwide key dates to your calendar. Navigate to the “Key Dates” section of HQ and click the “add to calendar” icon for available events. Once Astro, PwC’s cognitive agent, is launched firmwide, we will add the ability for you to see a more personalized list of “To Dos,” including a view of any tasks that you’ve set in Google Tasks and those added via Astro. How can I request new pages to be added to HQ? If you’d like to develop a new HQ page or migrate a site from another platform into HQ, please contact the HQ Team. Where do I go if I experience issues with HQ? If you have general questions/ comments about your HQ experience or need feedback community support, contact the HQ Team.

Click below to learn more about this exciting platform. About HQ HQ is our new intranet platform, replacing myKCurve. This modern digital workplace will serve as your front door to firmwide and LoS news, tools and resources. Together with myMetrics 2.0 and Astro, HQ is part of our journey toward an integrated digital experience across the firm. HQ Pages Each page within HQ is managed by a specific PwC team or function. If you have questions about content other than the HQ home page, please submit them through the “Questions for the Team” link on the page you are viewing. To request new HQ content/pages or changes to existing content/pages, please contact the HQ team. Need more help finding the content you need? Check out our Quick Reference Card. News News is personalized on the HQ home page, from top to bottom of the page by LoS, Sector, Sub-sector and Location. In addition, you'll see key firmwide news at the top of your page and in your news feed. The PwC Inside email will continue to be sent on Tuesdays and Fridays. New content will also be posted on the HQ home page regularly throughout the week. If you have a piece of news you’d like to submit, please email our editorial team. Search Search results display content (pages, microsites) and news (firmwide and LoS) native to HQ and do not include links from the Link Index (the Link Index can be filtered from within the Link Index page) Initially, searches won’t surface all of the results from Fathom, Accounting &amp; Auditing (A&amp;A), Tax Source, etc. that could be found from the search bar on myKcurve. But in subsequent releases, HQ search will integrate with these other platforms and display those results in addition to content and news native to HQ. In the meantime, the individual repositories for search - like Fathom, Accounting &amp; Auditing (A&amp;A) and Tax Source - can be added as Quick Links, or they can also be found in the Link Index. Quick Links Quick Links provide you easy access to your favorite applications and resources. By default, you are provided with a set of priority Quick Links, chosen by your LoS. You can change these or add more for a total of ten custom Quick Links. To add more, click “Add to quick links” (or “Edit quick links” if you have ten already set), search or browse for your favorite app, then select “+” to add it to your Quick Links. To remove one, click “-”. Personalization Your HQ experience is personalized, based on the data assigned to you in Workday. Currently, personalization is driven by your LoS, Sector, Sub-sector and Location (Market or Office). Future releases will expand personalization, as will HQ’s artificial intelligence that learns your search preferences the more you use it. HQ News and Quick Links are personalized to you. If you are looking for content that isn’t personalized to you (e.g., you’re in Advisory and looking for information or news from Assurance), use Search and then filter by any LoS. Need additional help? Tech support HQ bugs and requests for technology support should be directed to Service Hub.
