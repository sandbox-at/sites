Thousands of you have already downloaded the new Hangouts Chat mobile app. We’ve seen praise for features like Chat rooms, Meet integration and the ability to send images (which may have something to do with GIFs, but we like fun, too). You also had some great questions we’ll address here. How is Google Chat different from “classic” Hangouts? Here’s a sampling of the major differences. Chat lets you: Send screenshots, transfer files and share documents Create “Rooms” for your project or team, where you can save data and conversation history for six months (you’ve already created nearly 1500 Rooms!) Send “Direct messages” that disappear after 24 hours, just like Hangouts Start a Meet videoconference with one click Chat with PwC colleagues in all global territories currently using Google How do I access Chat? Is there an app? Download the Hangouts Chat mobile app from PwC’s App Store. We may release a desktop app for PC at a later date, but for now we use Chat right in Chrome: visit chat.google.com (right-click the browser tab to pin it). Remember, this is a newer tool and -- like us -- Google is focused on continuous improvement. What will happen to the old Hangouts? Google will keep Hangouts available for some time as Chat continues to evolve, but Google plans to retire Hangouts. One-to-one messages shared in Chat will be visible in Hangouts and vice versa. However, Rooms, screenshots, files, documents, Group messages and invitations to Chat groups will only be shareable in Chat. Why am I getting multiple notifications? If you have both Chat and Hangouts open, you may see two notifications for each message -- it’s best to choose just one tool. You can manage your notifications to allow or block each app, and also adjust notifications in the tools themselves. In Chat, click the gear icon and select Notification settings. In Hangouts, click the three dots → Options → Notifications. (Google recently changed how Chrome manages notifications -- with pop-ups in your PC’s Action Center in the lower-right corner -- but this is not caused by Chat.) What about Salesforce Chatter? Can we get Slack instead? Google Chat doesn’t replace Chatter. You should continue to use your current Salesforce Chatter groups to connect with your Account teams and for all Salesforce-related information. And no, we won’t be getting Slack anytime soon due to document retention and other security concerns. Can we talk about client work? You can use Chat just like you used Hangouts -- for both direct and group messages. However, that means that you should not use Chat or Hangouts for discussions covering information subject to an OGC legal hold. Don't post data about US clients or engagements in Google Chat Rooms, where it will be retained for six months. As always, follow the US Google Business Rules. How can I learn more?

As part of our Your Tomorrow strategy, the Audit Committee Reporter Tool includes ways to digitize and simplify engagement work to help deliver enhanced quality and valued insight to our clients. Specifically, the new tool which is a Powerpoint add-in powered by Templafy, allows you to: Pre-populate your audit committee report template with engagement team and client specific information. Include board appropriate trending topics through a live feed of current thought leadership. Easily access firm approved libraries of images and infographics, if desired. Still curious about how these features will benefit you and your team? Hear why Bud Thomas, a partner in the Cleveland, Ohio office, values the consistency the tool creates in the communication process with clients, essentially eliminating the variability in Audit Committee reporting from engagement to engagement and streamlining the messaging. And learn how Michelle Geller, a senior manager in Florham Park, New Jersey, and her team were inspired by the Audit Committee Reporter Tool to rethink the visuals (graphics and tables) they used to summarize areas of focus and content delivery -- resulting in reducing the number of pages in their report by more than half! If it’s your first time using the tool, don’t sweat it! Check out the “how to” video we released in PwC Inside back in June to help get you started.

USAA steps it up with PwC's Source to Pay Integrated Solution. Advisory - test May 2, 2019 Client problem: The United Services Automobile Association (USAA) is a Fortune 500 diversified financial services company offering banking, investing, and insurance to people and families who serve, or served, in the United States military. Due to an increase in assets, USAA jumped from a mid-tier to a large-tier bank, which meant more stringent regulatory requirements. The client requested an independent assessment of its overall Procurement and Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) capabilities. We delivered an elevator pitch (literally), which led to displacing our competitors who were midway through a TPRM project with the client(ouch)! We created a Magic Moment... We quickly demonstrated our value through an xLOS unified approach to an integrated Procurement and TPRM operating model. We staged a mock elevator ride for each of the team leads to share their workstream pitches. They were asked random questions by their team — which had been previously taped under their chair — leading to laughter and relaxed body language which changed the mood in the room instantaneously. This approach allowed personal perspectives to shine and brought meaningful conversations and an overall positive outcome. The USAA Program PMO ended the meeting with a smile saying, “We never have meetings like this at USAA.” We have increased the firm revenue from $700k to $35 million in less than 18 months. The solution and value we brought Leveraging the Source to Pay Integrated Solution, we incorporated the vision, policy, and value management framework and roles. Through additional value capture analysis, we have also projected year-over-year savings of at least 1% - 3% on $3.3B of addressable spend. Investing the time and energy upfront to deeply understand the client’s true needs allowed us to develop our winning approach, which incorporated elements of the Risk &amp; Regulatory and Fit for Growth platforms. We automated various processes to remove redundancies, and we reduced complexity by standardizing practices, policies, and procedures. Meet the USAA Team! Thanks also to the following leadership team members: Becky Mackin, Martin Thomas, Rob Walley, Brett Anton, Charles Bruen, Michael Clark, Mirna Elia, Steven Klatt-Lasso, Jared Larkin, Leah Odom, Katee Puterbaugh, Akil Rao, Dan Schultz, Dominic Sugrue, Eric Willyoung What is Source to Pay? Source to Pay is more than a process, it’s a holistic approach, encompassing both Source to Contract and Procure to Pay. Source to Contract (S2C) applies to most of the upfront strategic initiatives, selecting and contracting with suppliers. Procure to Pay (P2P) is the transactional buying process of the good or service. The S2P process spans multiple stakeholder groups like Procurement, Finance, Tax &amp; Treasury, Risk &amp; Controls, and Business Units and is enabled by key functionality to create and efficient user experience. Contact the Source to Pay Integrated Solution team - we’re here to help! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature.

We'll update this article when we're ready to proceed -- thanks for your patience. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It’s almost time for your PC to get the latest version of Windows 10! These annual system updates are required for your online safety and our firm’s compliance responsibilities. You won’t be able to use your PC for up to an hour, and the process can take two hours in total. When is this happening? The upgrade will roll out by LoS over the coming weeks, starting this week with IFS. Upgrades must be completed by Dec 30. After that time, Microsoft will no longer support the older version of Windows 10, and you won’t be able to connect to PwC’s network. But don’t worry — we’ve allowed plenty of time so you can plan when to upgrade. What to expect during your Windows 10 upgrade This update consists of two stages, and each can take up to an hour. You can use your PC during the initial stage, but you won’t be able to during the latter. Here’s what will happen: You’ll receive a pop-up message labeled Restart Utility. If it’s not a convenient time, you may defer for a week (more on this below). To continue with the upgrade, select Install; the update will begin in the background. You can continue to use your PC. 2. When it’s time to proceed, you’ll see a restart notification. Note that after you select Restart Now, you won’t be able to use your PC for up to an hour. Save all your data and restart promptly (the PC will restart on its own after two hours). 3. During installation, you’ll see the screen below. The update can’t be paused or deferred at this point; any interruption could cause a critical error. Your PC will automatically reboot several times. No action is needed, so take a break! You’ll know the upgrade is complete when you see your Windows logon screen. Now your PC is up to date, and it’s business as usual. Did you defer? Restart the upgrade in Software Center If you defer the initial pop-up, you don’t have to wait until you get the next one. Software Center is the new home to install all firm-provided software (it replaces Software Installer; for details refer to this guide). To restart the Windows 10 upgrade: Click the Windows Search icon, type Software Center and select it from the menu. On the “Updates” tab, select “Feature update to Windows 10…” and click Install. You can continue to use your PC while the installation begins (this can take up to an hour); the process will continue as described in step two above. Questions?

Experienced Associate Chris Manuszak and Manager Patrick McFall run marathons to boost their energy and find balance, even during the busiest periods. With the support of their colleagues, they’re crossing finish lines in impressive style. Patrick competes in some of the world’s toughest endurance races. Earlier this month, he finished a 155-mile (250 km) race through the African Namib desert. This was his third ultra-marathon, having previously run through the Atacama Desert and the mountains of Patagonia in Argentina. According to Patrick, “PwC’s culture of flexibility and well-being made it possible to train for and travel to these international marathons. Despite our hectic work schedule, my peers and leadership team encouraged me to pursue my personal goals. I’m grateful to work for a firm that values its people and prioritizes well-being.” Chris completed the Boston marathon in April and fulfilled his goal of racing three marathons over the past year. “It wasn’t easy training through the cold winter in Michigan, especially while consistently working 50+ hour weeks and fulfilling various client obligations,” he says. “Through it all, my team supported my goals, even though my morning runs meant I would come in later some days. With their help, the hard work paid off and I finished the race in Boston with a time of 2:58.” Patrick and Chris recognize the importance of well-being and understand how PwC’s commitment to flexibility can help them meet their personal goals. By communicating with their teams and setting reasonable expectations, they achieved their marathon ambitions while also fulfilling their client-service obligations. Do you have personal goals you want to achieve and need some time away? Put your plans on the agenda for your next team meeting.

This award comes from Forrester Research, adding to similar leadership awards for the Cybersecurity and Privacy practice. In the report, Forrester’s Jeff Pollard, Vice President of Global Risk and Security Research, and Claire O’Malley, Director of Research state: “PwC shines with IP-based consulting enhanced by delivery teams. PwC recognised earlier than its competitors that it could win clients by demonstrating that its unique IP led to successful client engagements.” The report also calls out our Cybersecurity &amp; Privacy Innovation Challenge program: “PwC has a robust innovation program that allows consultants to create new ideas and enroll in an internal incubator. If accepted, winners eschew delivery responsibilities as they iterate on new services to make them enterprise ready, find product/market fit, and roll them out to the consulting organisation.” Mohamed Kande, US and Global Advisory Leader, added: "We are thrilled that PwC is recognized as a leader in cybersecurity consulting services by Forrester Research. This is an outstanding achievement and a testament to the great strides we've made in building our capabilities and serving our clients… We'll continue to invest in our cybersecurity and privacy services and talent -- remaining a trusted advisor to the Boards, C-suite executives, and stakeholders across our clients in their most vulnerable times. Our priorities remain to help clients secure their digital transformation initiatives, create organizational resilience, and derive risk and business value from data. With this remarkable recognition, our teams will continue to execute on those priorities knowing that we're making a difference in our mission to build trust in a digital economy."

Be well, work well is a central part of our Your Tomorrow strategy — and that includes not only physical well-being, but also taking care of our emotional and mental well-being. As you heard on the Firmwide Town Hall, our new Ginger Emotional Support app provides confidential emotional health support for each of us and our family members (age 18+)1 at no cost. Live coaches can chat with you on demand via the app anytime, anywhere. It's free, convenient and completely confidential — any information you share is kept private between you and your coaches. You do not need to be enrolled in a PwC medical plan in order to take advantage of this service. What can you connect with an emotional health coach about? Coaches ask questions to get a clear understanding of your lifestyle and goals to create a personalized plan. Ginger coaches can help with: Achieving goals Recovering from loss Building self-esteem Improving communication Getting through a hard day To get started: Visit PwC's Ginger registration site at http://bit.ly/gingerpwc. On that page, register to access Ginger by entering your PwC Google email address2. You’ll receive a welcome email from Ginger with three access codes - one for you, and two for your spouse/domestic partner/dependents (age 18+) should they choose to use the service. If you need additional codes for other dependents, contact the Ginger team at help@ginger.io. Download the Ginger Emotional Support app from the PwC App Store (available for Android and iOS). Once in the app, enter the unique code that was sent to your PwC email address. From there, you'll be able to select any email address you choose. How is emotional health coaching different from therapy? Coaching is solely focused on providing day-to-day support and guidance, and helping develop the skills you need to overcome a barrier or achieve a goal. The goals of therapy are broader. Therapy is designed specifically for people who need to deepen their self-awareness or better understand their thoughts and feelings. After working with you, a coach may recommend therapy, depending on your goals. If you already work with a therapist, you can still rely on a coach for additional day-to-day support. To be our best, we need to take care of ourselves. Even if you feel like you don’t need this resource right now, it’s good to know that help is there whenever and wherever you need it. If you want to learn more about Ginger, check out the FAQs or email the Ginger team at help@ginger.io. And, keep an eye out for colleagues walking around the office wearing green ribbons in support of reducing the stigma around mental health in honor of Mental Health Month. 1 Partners and staff, and their spouse/domestic partner and dependents age 18+. 2 If you are a new hire, it may take 10-14 days before you can register with Ginger due to file transmission timing.

One Firm Risk Organization April 18, 2019 It’s critical to keep in mind the importance of documenting our work, including significant discussions -- internally and with the client -- throughout the engagement. All substantive client discussions related to the engagement -- including phone calls -- should be documented and included in the engagement file in DMS. Engagement teams should use professional judgment in deciding which client discussions and/or phone calls are “of substance” to the engagement, as well as in the overall preparation of the documentation. It’s recommended that engagement teams review the Documentation Toolkit for guidance on appropriate documentation. Useful tools and templates are available in the Toolkit to assist with the documentation process, such as a template that can be used to document verbal advice provided during client discussions and phone calls. The “File to TaxDMS” button - a Chrome extension available for download from the PwC Chrome Store - makes it easier to file Google emails and email attachments to DMS with a few simple clicks. Access this File to DMS from Gmail - Quick Reference Guide for instructions on how to add and use the “File to TaxDMS” button. As a reminder, the quality and contemporaneous filing of appropriate documentation for engagements is formally being assessed as part of the Tax Office Review program, including the documentation of substantive client discussions related to the engagement. For additional information related to the Tax Office Review Documentation Evaluation, please access this link for a template of the assessment and relevant help guidance. For any questions about Google, please refer to the Google PwC Spark page. For any questions about documentation protocols, please contact the OFRO Tax team.

Just like updates to apps on an iPhone, we continuously make improvements to Salesforce functionality and capability, based on your feedback and the latest technology. Here’s what’s new and improved in the Aug. 6 release: Unlocking won opportunities is more convenient The Opportunity Owner and Opportunity Lead can now unlock a won opportunity to make edits if needed. After clicking the “Unlock Opportunity” button, details on the opportunity are editable for the next seven days. At that point, the opportunity will close automatically unless the Owner or Lead adjusts the stage from “won” to a previous stage. Connect closed opportunities without reopening Click on the "Connect Existing Opportunity" button to connect existing closed opportunities without having to re-open them. Also use the button to connect multiple opportunities. Searching for users to add to an opportunity team just got easier When adding team members to an opportunity team, searching for a person’s name will show you the name, territory, LoS and email address. These additional fields will help to distinguish between people who have the same name. New “Role” field in Contacts adds helpful details A new field for “Role” on the Contact page standardizes how contacts can be grouped by their functional area within an organization. This field, located above “Buying Role,” includes finance, human resources, IT, internal audit, legal, marketing, operations, risk &amp; compliance, sales, strategy, tax, executive, audit committee and board member. Post-meeting notes are easier to find You can now find notes created from an Introhive post-meeting capture digest on the client record in the activities tab under the “Past Activities” heading as a “Closed Task.” Release outage While enhancements are made, Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, Aug. 3 at 9 p.m. ET to Sunday, Aug. 5 at 11 a.m. ET.

It’s our strategy to be paid for the value we deliver and the Your Tomorrow investments we’re making to tech-enable our services and processes. With One Firm Smart Pricing, we’re evolving our pricing focus. Historically, we’ve priced primarily based on rates and hours. Going forward, we will leverage both traditional and Alternative Fee Arrangements (AFAs) — where appropriate — to make sure our pricing captures the value we deliver through our solutions. Learn more about the story behind Smart Pricing in this short video. Learn more: We launched a new One Firm Smart Pricing site. This site, which is also available as an app in PwC’s App Store, is your one-stop shop for all things Pricing and includes playbooks, SmartGuides, videos, podcasts, FAQs and more. At the time of launch, partners, directors and managers have access to the site. For all other team members, please work with your managers to discuss your role in getting smart on our pricing strategies. Remember, while we are transitioning to AFAs, our existing risk management and independence policies will not change, particularly as they relate to contingent fees, value-based fees, discretionary fees and phased engagements with restricted entities and contingent fees for all tax engagements. If you have questions, be sure to talk with our OFRO independence and risk management resources. What this means for your line of service: We know that each LoS is in a different place today. On the microsite, you’ll find a wealth of information in the Line of Service Resources section: Tax, Assurance, Risk Assurance or Advisory. Continue to watch for more information from your LoS Pricing leader. What’s coming next: In the coming months, we’ll introduce business guidelines and preferred pricing structures for many of our services and products, a Smart Pricing tool for select businesses and products and upskilling opportunities related to pricing and value acumen. Here’s what you can do now: Everyone has the opportunity to get to know our pricing strategy and where we are heading. For those that have access to the microsite, here are some ways to get started: Make a move on the Pricing Gameboard for the key Pricing Structures and Enablers. Visit your LoS pages on the site to learn more from the LoS perspective. Pricing questions? Check-out the FAQs. Need a pricing definition? See the glossary.

Now reach more PwCers with Google Meet's new Live Stream feature. Live Stream is ideal for when you anticipate a lot of PwC viewers and don’t need to interact directly with them (e.g., you don’t need to chat with them or track their attendance). This tool is also a great option to manage which attendees are able to contribute to the Meet versus view only. Keep in mind that just like link sharing, any PwC Live Stream viewer or participant can further share the link with others in the PwC network. Since attendance isn’t tracked, the owner/organizer will not know how many other individuals view the content. Don’t use Live Stream to discuss confidential or sensitive info. Live streams are only viewable to those with PwC Google accounts — external clients or colleagues are not able to view. Again, live stream links can be shared anywhere within the PwC network and the Meet owner won’t have the ability to determine who streamed the Meet. As with all things Google, be sure to follow the Global Google Business Rules and US Business Rules when using these tools. How to schedule a Live Stream Create a Google Calendar invite. Click Add conferencing and select Hangouts Meet. Then, click the Hangout Meets drop down menu and select Add Live Stream. Your Calendar invite will then have two links — one for the Meet and another for the Live Stream. Those who join the regular Meet link can broadcast on the Live Stream, so only include presenters in that invite. It’s best to create a separate calendar invite for the Live Stream attendees. Live Stream is available to any individual who has a PwC Google account. How to start your Live Stream When you start your Meet session, you’ll see a prompt to start streaming (or click the three dots at the bottom and select Start streaming). A red “Live” alert will appear in the top left to let you and your participants know you’re live streaming. For more info, refer to these FAQs.

These relationships are absolutely critical, which is why mentoring is a cornerstone of our Access Your PotentialⓇ commitment. Many of us were fortunate to have someone in our lives who played this role, helping us with everything from applying for financial aid to choosing a college major. Too many students across the country may not be so lucky, especially those seeking to become the first in their families to go to college. In fact, only 27% of first-generation students earn a degree after four years, compared to 42% of students who come from families with higher-education experience. Hundreds of PwCers are stepping up to close this gap by paying it forward -- sharing the guidance they themselves received, along with their own personal experiences, as part of ongoing mentoring relationships with young people across the country. Here are three of their stories: Jordan Jobs, New York Metro, iMentor Joining iMentor has been a great experience. iMentor pairs young professionals with public high school students in low-income communities to provide mentorship through their high school years, and ultimately help them through the college application process. As a young black woman with few visible role models growing up, I was inspired to join iMentor to guide another young woman to achieve her dreams of attending college. I have had the pleasure of getting to know my mentee, Mia, and I look forward to watching her grow. Veon Watson, Hallandale, Sunland Park Elementary School Each Career Day I present to students on career choices in digital. I provide an overview of my job as a Digital Analyst + Digital Strategist. I also highlight my experience as a Woman in STEM (especially being a minority woman) and provide encouragement to the female students on pursuing a career in STEM regardless of biases that may exist. Sunland Park is an inner-city, lower-income school that does not provide a lot of exposure for career options in this realm. Cassandra Thompson, Cleveland, College Now Greater Cleveland College Now Greater Cleveland guides students of all ages across Northeastern Ohio, helping them achieve their dreams of higher education and career success. As a mentor, I email my mentee twice a month and meet in person twice a year for the duration of their college journey. I was matched to my first mentee (pictured) this school year, so our journey began in August. In New York, Chicago or the Bay Area?

If you’re working on a project and need specific skills or extra resources, TalentLink’s Bulletin Board feature can help. What is the TalentLink Bulletin Board? The Bulletin Board is a TalentLink feature that allows you to post small and short-term assignments and projects. It efficiently connects those who need an extra pair of hands with those who are looking for new opportunities and ways to demonstrate their skills. Who can use the Bulletin Board? All partners and staff can post to the Bulletin Board to request help on internal or client work that requires 20 hours or less (e.g., client engagements, recruiting events, proposal support, internal initiatives). Everyone can also search the Bulletin Board for available opportunities and “raise their hands” to be considered for assignments. Note: Having a detailed and regularly updated TalentLink profile can help increase your chances of being selected for projects. How does it work? It’s simple! Launch TalentLink Bulletin Board or click on the “Thumbtack” icon in the left navigation from TalentLink homepage. A new window will open with all the available opportunities. Need help on a project? Just click on “Create a new role” at the top left to post it to the Bulletin Board. See a project where you can help? Click on “Consider me for this role.” See a cool role for a colleague?

One Firm Risk Organization Dec. 14, 2018 We’ve updated the US Independence Policy (USIP) for a number of different topics that may impact you -- regardless of your line of service, role and responsibility. The overview below highlights key updates included in this release, which is effective Dec. 14, 2018. For a comprehensive list of all USIP updates, with full details, visit the updated US Independence Policy on our One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) portal. Key updates include: Updated policies on partner rotation on audit engagements. Based on updated international independence standards that become effective this month, there are revised policies on “time off” considerations for partners on audits of public interest entities. Updated policy on assessing the execution of non-audit services. During the execution of a non-audit services engagement, group audit engagement partners should be involved in assessing that the services do not extend beyond the scope of services initially authorized. New policies on providing professional references on behalf of others. These updates address situations when a PwC partner or practice staff member is asked to provide a professional reference on behalf of another individual. Learn more View the details of these and other revisions included in this update (relating to, in part, breaches, indemnification and cumulative effects of non-audit services).

As we enter into a particularly busy season with fewer daylight hours, we want to remind you of precautions you can take to ensure your safety in, and traveling to and from, the office. Walk in pairs to your vehicle or public transportation. Or, if your building offers the service, have building security escort you to your vehicle. If your building has attached parking and you need to stay late, you can submit an expense to be reimbursed for parking fees if you move your car into building parking after 5 p.m. Support office security by displaying your badge -- and help make sure others do the same. If anyone attempts to follow you in without a badge, politely direct them to reception or building security. The best defense includes being alert, aware and prepared. Wherever you are, be aware of your surroundings, avoid isolated areas and be protective of your laptop and personal belongings. Get to know the security programs in place to protect and support you, your family and the firm during crisis and emergency situations. To-do, today -- some security basics: You know to dial 911 first in an emergency. But did you also know that the PwC Emergency Hotline is a critical secondary line of support and guidance for you and your family? Program the number into your mobile device today -- it’s also printed on your PwC security badge for quick reference. 1-888-755-1515 (US) 00-1-813-351-6460 (outside US, collect calls accepted) Make sure your personal information is up-to-date in Workday. Register at least one emergency contact with PwC so our crisis teams can support you when you need it. Visit our US Security site for additional resources and helpful videos on more actions you can take to protect yourself, your colleagues and the firm. Remember, you are PwC’s most important asset. We want you to be safe and secure, no matter where you are.

You can support the firm’s Responsible Business Leadership strategy in many ways -- through Access Your Potential and other volunteer opportunities, giving, Green Teams and more. Running our business responsibly means taking care to be environmentally responsible, and we’ve accomplished a lot in this area: We’ve reduced our net carbon footprint by 45% over the past 10 years. We purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) to cover 100% of the carbon emissions from our firmwide electricity use. Starting in FY19, we offset 100% of our carbon emissions from air travel through the purchase of tree reforestation efforts and other offset programs. We reduced energy consumption per employee by 40% through more efficient use of office space and encouraging people to work remotely. 63% of our office space is LEED interior certified, meeting the highest industry design standards for environmental efficiency. We reuse or recycle all of the firm's electronic waste (old IT devices like laptops and other equipment). Over the last year, we reduced our office paper consumption by 23%, a total savings amount equal to covering half of New York’s Central Park. This is not only good for the planet, but it’s also important to our clients and our business. More and more of our clients are working to improve their environmental performance, making our own commitment relevant to meeting their needs.

What we stand for: Take 5 minutes and read the Global Tax Code of Conduct. The Global Tax Code of Conduct covers the conduct of the member firms, who they should act for, and how they should act. 2. Do you have contract changes to standard terms and conditions? Here’s what you need to do. The approval of OFRO Tax is required as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process when there are changes to standard terms and conditions in a contract. To obtain OFRO Tax approval, mark “Yes” to question 2.4 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment and answer the questions that follow appropriately, providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Read more &gt; 3. Do you e-file any state returns? Important changes to the process you need to know about. A new state e-file requirement related to application software updates will impact our internal PwC e-file process. If you calculate a return on one release, you have 10 business days after the next release to transmit the return to the IRS. Once those 10 business days have passed, the return has "expired," and will not be transmitted. Read more &gt; 4. Individual Clients - What you need to know about contracting and obtaining consents and FROR confirmations. It is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols for the following contract language and policies -- Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR), Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information and Privacy Policy Notices. All Tax professionals (Associates through Partners), who provide services to individual clients - including PCS, PFS, Law Firm services, IAS, Investment Management and Real Estate practices - are required to take this course in Vantage Financial Reporting Oversight Roles. Read more &gt; 5. Do you “need to know”? Protect client and firm confidential information. Access to client and firm confidential information should be limited to only those individuals that have a “need to know.” Disclosing or discussing confidential client information or private firm matters outside of the proper channels can put both you and the firm at risk. Read on for more on what you can do to protect client and firm confidential information.

However, it’s important to note, as part of turning on this feature in TalentLink, there are important business rules that must be followed under the firm’s Risk Management policies: Core Assurance, Core Audit SDC, PCS, TEA Audit Technical skills tracking is allowed for Digital Skills only. Search for “Digital Skills” in the Technical Skills section and choose from the list of skills automatically displayed on screen. Skills tracking is not allowed for Audit skills or Non-Digital skill areas. In addition, proficiency/experience level for Industry should not be updated. FS BAS, Innovation &amp; Tech (excludes TEA Audit), Risk Assurance, Risk Assurance SDC, TS Technical skills tracking is allowed but not allowed for: Audit &amp; Accounting skills or Industry For example, skills in auditing Accounts Receivable, Cash, Accounts Payable, etc. should not be updated in your TalentLink profile. When you update your profile, please add your Digital Skills and then select additional technical skill areas. Refer to this guide as you fill out the section. The purpose of the technical skills section is not to list every skill achieved, but rather to answer the questions “what do I want to be known for?” and “what do I want to be found for?” You can also add skills that you don’t have today and are interested in developing. In addition to highlighting your technical (or applicable digital only) skills, this is a great time to revisit your TalentLink profile to ensure it reflects your capabilities and experiences. Take a few extra minutes to update other sections in your profile with your experiences and interests (including language) and confirm your TalentLink schedule is accurate. The information included in your TalentLink profile and schedule are actively used to help your deployment team better align your skills, experience, &amp; career interests for staffing assignments.

The ASC is a representative group of your colleagues from across the US and Mexico who provide input to the Assurance Leadership team on our strategic priorities, as well as operational and people matters. These 50 council members were selected by their MALs and BU leaders based on their leadership skills, collaboration, and solution-oriented mindset. This year we will have ~48% of our FY18 council members return. We received positive feedback from previous council members and leadership suggesting that including recurring council members is beneficial to the continuity of existing ASC matters. The FY19 ASC co-leads will represent the Assurance LoS on a newly-created One Firm Staff Council. Our co-leads will strengthen how we collaborate, communicate and deliver a One Firm approach within and across our Staff Advisory Councils. The council will meet for the first time mid- November in New York and they want to hear from you! Please take time to connect with the representative(s) from your market or business unit now and throughout the year to provide your feedback and input on whatever is top of mind for you and your Peers.

But it’s not always easy to build a relationship with the board. The perfect opportunity to start a conversation: Our 2018 Annual Corporate Directors Survey provides insights from 700+ public company directors, with perspectives on topics from cultural oversight to cybersecurity to boardroom diversity. The survey is published by the Governance Insights Center -- a team dedicated to helping boards of directors meet the challenges of their critical roles and duties. Led by Paula Loop, the team meets with boards of directors, institutional executives and the C-suite to share leading practices in corporate governance; publishes practical thought leadership on boardroom hot topics; and hosts events on current governance issues. Three of our top findings provide a unique One Firm glimpse into the issues many clients are facing today: Social issues and strategy make a stronger connection Social issues are slowly making their way into the boardroom. In fact, directors are becoming more open to considering social issues when discussing company strategy. Issues such as healthcare availability and cost, resource scarcity and human rights are much higher on directors’ radars this year. The cybersecurity disconnect: Awareness is hot, crisis management is not Cybersecurity is a constantly moving target. Still, directors say they’re on the ball. They’re more comfortable with what their companies are doing around the topic, and they’re taking steps to prepare for a cyber incident. But a cyberattack can happen to any company at any time. Are boards really sure their company won’t be caught flat-footed if there’s a breach? Evaluating corporate culture: Going with your gut may not be enough A company’s culture isn’t always easy to define, but it drives what people do and don’t do. Boards need to help promote a strong culture – one that promotes the right behaviors throughout the company. So what do directors think is actually useful in their oversight role? Hearing from employees. Topping the list of the most useful metrics for evaluating the culture are employee engagement survey results, exit interview debriefs and feedback results for executives. Here are two steps you can take today to start building a stronger relationship with your client’s board: Contact Paula Loop and request a governance SME to come meet with your client’s board or management team about findings from the survey Use our Conversation starter letter to reach out to directors at your clients For more information: Visit our ACDS webpage Find our Conversation Starter letter on our US Governance Insights Center site Learn more about the Governance Insights Center Contact Paula Loop Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/38331.html</url><pwc_title>Vantage gets personal</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-07 05:57:15</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>newsType:Firmwide|source:People Team</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-03-18 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>People Team</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Vantage gets personal Vantage gets personal People Team March 18, 2019 Infinite learning at PwC is easy with Vantage.

This can be an effective means of managing the Responsible Partner’s (as identified in CES) pre-approval obligations and can be extremely helpful in achieving compliance with firm policy. As background, many audit clients have a Pre-approval Framework Agreement in place, which is an approach used to obtain and document audit committee pre-approval for recurring or known (at the time of preparing the Framework) tax services to be provided to the client during the audit engagement period. For example, tax compliance and tax compliance related services provided annually and other types of detailed, pre-defined tax consulting services, may be included in a client’s Pre-Approval Framework Agreement to obtain Audit Committee pre-approval well in advance of actually engaging to provide the services. In these cases, the Framework AFS can be obtained after Audit Committee pre-approval is granted and should mirror the client’s Pre-approval Framework Agreement’s detailed scope of services for those pre-approved non-audit services. An approved Framework AFS will provide the necessary approvals to “clear the way” for engagement teams to be engaged to provide previously pre-approved tax services as requested by the client. However, care should be used to ensure that the non-audit services that are being provided clearly fall under the Framework AFS. In many cases, the Responsible Partner may still request that a separate AFS also be submitted as each project kicks off for notification/tracking purposes. If a separate AFS is requested, a best practice that should be considered is to also reference the Framework AFS at that time. Tax engagement teams should discuss with the respective Responsible Partner the procedures to be followed to obtain pre-approval for any non-audit services to be provided to their restricted clients and/or their affiliates, including whether a Pre-approval Framework Agreement has been agreed to with the client and the relevant PCAOB Rule 3524 communications have been made. If a Pre-approval Framework Agreement is not being used for your restricted client and/or their affiliate, consider having a discussion with the Responsible Partner regarding the use of a Pre-approval Framework Agreement approach. For additional information, see the Pre-approval Framework Agreements and Independence section on the Tax Independence microsite. Questions?

Some of our best candidates come from your referrals. In fact, we’ve found that candidate referrals are quick to onboard and make an impact on the business. Most importantly, they stay with the firm longer. Referring experienced candidates is easy and must be done in Workday. Simply type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to get started and find the job that suits someone you know. In order to receive credit for making a referral, you must submit your referral to a specific job. This will also give you visibility into your referral’s status throughout the process (simply type ”My Referrals” in the Workday search bar to see their progress). As an added incentive, if you you refer a candidate who is ultimately hired, you may be entitled to a referral reward. Please also note these important reminders: Only experienced referrals should be submitted through Workday. Refer to the Employee Referral Program site for guidance regarding entry-level referrals. To receive a referral reward, you must submit experienced referrals to a posted open role through Workday before your referral applies for the role. Immediately after you submit the experienced referral, the referred candidate will receive an automated email directing them to apply through a specific link. Your referral must use this referral link to apply for the role. If your referred candidate does not use the referral link, they will not be tagged as a referral and recruiters will not be notified that the candidate is a referral. For appropriate credit and status updates, referred candidates cannot be accepted through Google email or any other means except the Workday referral link. Your referred candidate’s status in Workday will not be visible to you until they have applied to the specific job via the referral link. For more information, take a moment to review the Employee Referral Program quick reference card (QRC) and policy. Make sure you follow the guidance above so you don’t miss out on a referral bonus! If you have questions about submitting referrals, please contact the Employee Referral Team.

Throughout FY19, we’re sharing Real-time recognition tips. In this article, we focus on the value of social recognition. Our world is increasingly more social because of technology and our connections to others have become essential to our growth and development. The Recognition activity feed in the Real-time recognition tool is one way we can show appreciation and motivate our colleagues by giving virtual high fives. Social recognition amplifies appreciation and strengthens relationships by creating a continuous loop of positive feedback. It enables everyone to see what people value, congratulate colleagues and be inspired to emulate the behavior. On the Recognition activity feed you can view awards received by your colleagues and add your own message of congratulations. Simply type a brief, thoughtful message and click Congratulate. Your message will appear in the feed and the recipient will receive an email summarizing the messages they’ve received. Tip! Awards with videos and photos get more congratulatory messages than those with only text, so when you’re recognizing someone, make it more meaningful and memorable by adding a photo or video. The maximum file size accepted is 40 MB. You may include a message along with your media. Refer to the User Guide for details on how to adjust privacy settings on the activity feed. Please don’t share client names, confidential information or any comments outside of our Code of Conduct in your recognition message. More info: Based on your feedback, we’ve added the option to recognize staff in the US with a $25 award. If you recognize staff in other territories, they will receive the same award level at a value in their home-country denomination. Use your Real-time recognition balance by Jan. 16, 2019 or you will lose it. Budgets are loaded twice per year to promote more frequent recognition -- half of your annual budget was loaded in the system in Sept. and the second half will be loaded on Jan. 17, 2019. (Note: You will see your spending balance during the recognition process on your PC.) Relationship Leaders can see if their assignees have been recognized by clicking the “My team” link on the Recognition home page. You can adjust the privacy settings on the Recognition activity feed. Keep an eye out for future installments of our tips series. Have you shown appreciation today? Visit Real-time recognition.

Want to know how our Your Tomorrow efforts are going? Read our top five takeaways -- and Tim's three asks of all of us -- then get the full story by watching the replay of yesterday’s Town Hall: Your Tomorrow is happening today. Our world is evolving and PwC is evolving with it. Tim Ryan provided an update on all that’s happened since our last Town Hall back in October when we launched our Your Tomorrow strategy. Your Tomorrow is how we bring the best of the firm to our clients with more value and a more digital experience, and how we are building the skills we need to lead and thrive. Since last fall, we’ve downloaded nearly 150,000 apps from PwC’s App store (including the wildly popular Calm app), more than 45,000 of us have taken part in a habit plan as part of our Be well, work well efforts, and 3,500 of us have self-nominated to become Digital Accelerators. And our July 4 firmwide week-long shutdown was a result of the tremendous progress we made through the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge in the US, while the challenge continues in Mexico. But there’s still lots more to come. Your Tomorrow is all about our investment in you -- and in transforming PwC for a digital future. Chief Digital Officer Joe Atkinson shared a preview of what we can expect in the future as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy, including our pledge to get Digitally Fit by the end of FY19 through podcasts, quizzes, market-based events and more. He also talked about our efforts to build a world-class data platform, one that provides access to the right data anywhere, anytime, securely and on any device. He even shared a “day in the life” view of what our firm will look like 12-18 months from now, based on technology and initiatives that are already here or currently in development! We’re skill building -- in our firm and in our communities. In addition to the plan Joe laid out for digitally upskilling our own people, he shared a video that demonstrated the power of our Access Your Potential® commitment to build technology skills of students from overlooked and underserved communities through our partnership with Code.org. Access Your Potential® includes three pillars: Along with building tech skills, we continue to focus on financial literacy (building on the foundation set through our Earn Your Future® efforts) and mentoring. You can find similar Access Your Potential® volunteer opportunities on Impact Space. And the winner is … We had some amazing entries for The habit challenge, but at the end of the day, The Real Auditors of Estero took home the big prize … and the oversized plane ticket! Southeast Market People Leader Melisa Cook made the presentation to team leader Arionna Gunderman. Arionna shared that by making a couple of small habit changes, the team was able to see big results … and win the grand prize of a three-day, two-night stay at a luxury resort and round-trip airfare for each team member and a companion, and a $250 resort voucher! Read more about The Real Auditors of Estero, and all of our Top 50 The habit challenge finalists, here. Upward and peer feedback is coming back! Melisa joined Tim for a Q&amp;A segment featuring some of your most frequently asked questions. Joe provided detailed information around what’s next for our Digital Accelerators program, and Tim shared updates on our response to the #MeToo movement, telling our digital story and that our popular upward and peer feedback program would be coming back and would be better than ever, since it will now be available year-round. Upward and peer feedback functionality will be available through Workday, our new global, mobile, and cloud-based human capital system. With the Workday launch, Tim also shared that our PwC Professional framework is now simpler, clearer and aligned to our new global staff levels. Watch for more information on Workday coming later this summer! Tim’s 3 “asks” Tim also shared his three “asks” of all of us: Become Digitally Fit by continuing to leverage the Digital Fitness app and by taking advantage of Digital Upskilling opportunities once they roll out. Also, if you’re interested in becoming a Digital Accelerator, watch for more information on how to apply the next time the nomination window opens! Tell our story. We’re creating materials that will help you communicate to our clients around our digital journey. Once available, make sure you understand our story yourself, and are able to share it with your clients, stakeholders, professional and social networks. There’s nothing more powerful than hearing firsthand the impact that the changes we’re making is having on our firm. Work together to drive our strategy forward. We’ve got an ambitious agenda in front of us, and it will only work if we’re all pulling in the same direction. Talk with your team about how you can get Digitally Fit together.

We've updated the primary credential policy! Have you heard? We've updated the primary credential policy! Assurance March 4, 2019 Effective March 1, 2019, Assurance will no longer require associates to pass a primary credential exam for promotion to senior associate. Hear directly from our Assurance People Leader, Laura Martinez, to find out what is changing and what it means for you. While Assurance no longer requires primary credential exams for promotion to senior associate, achieving a credential as early in your career as possible continues to be very important. To further support you in achieving your credential early, here are a few additional enhancements to the policy that you should be aware of: We are increasing the Assurance primary credential exam bonuses to reward those associates who pass exams early. The increased bonus awards are retroactive for all current associates and those who were promoted January 1, 2019 to senior associate who have already received a primary credential bonus. The incremental bonus amounts will be paid on April 30, 2019. Associates will have 40 hours per year of protected time to book in TalentLink to study for your primary credential exam. Your deployment team will help you schedule this time based on client demands. For those who have an expired Becker license and are eligible to renew the program at the PwC discounted price under the Becker Promise they will only be responsible to pay 50% of the cost - the firm will cover the other 50% one additional time. For all the Assurance Credential Policy details, please review the updated credential policy as it provides the pertinent information that you need to know about credential requirements. If you have any questions please reach out to your Relationship Leader or Talent Consultant. You can also refer to the following FAQ document.

Relationship Check provides a single point of entry to request a search of US firm records for relationships — such as client or supplier relationships — with an entity or individual. Where needed, it will also facilitate a request for non-US relationship data from PwC network firms and track all results in a single platform. Most importantly, the new application provides more targeted, relevant relationship data. Audit partners and staff should use My Independence Assessment — launched in November — to meet independence assessment requirements. My Independence Assessment is accessible via the Assurance Engagement Center and also provides a streamlined, easy user experience. Relationship Check and My Independence Assessment are only available for those with Salesforce licenses, typically managers through partners. Have questions or need help? Reach out to the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO). For questions specific to interpreting your relationship check results, email Ask OFRO or call (866)-844-1846 (voice mailbox only). If you have a question about navigating the new system, reach out to the OFRO Relationship Check group. For technical support, call 1-866-PwC-Help.

To continuously improve their disclosures, they seek real-time insights into the questions the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is asking peer companies. Responding to this need, Gilbert Lindsay and Michael Patrick, directors on tour in National Quality Organization (NQO), created a digital platform to provide our clients an interactive, mobile experience to explore the topical areas currently trending in comments issued by the SEC staff. In doing so, they’ve moved from giving clients a once a year analysis to an agile, digital platform providing deeper, real time analysis of future SEC comment letter trends. The new platform has been a differentiator for the firm — our clients and our people. It provides clients an interactive experience resulting in improved user engagement, and helps our people stay up to date and deliver value with timely conversations. The SEC's filing review process is a key function to monitor the critical accounting and disclosure decisions applied by clients; by analyzing their comments, our platform identifies trends in the SEC’s focus areas over time and connects our clients with relevant thought leadership. Visit and share the SEC comment letter trends web site for mobile-friendly publications that will help you have timely accounting and reporting conversations with your clients.

The next step on this simplification journey is retiring unneeded Lotus Notes applications and databases. We’ll start that process Feb. 28. Read on to find out how to prepare. What to expect First, rest assured that any business-critical tasks currently operating in Lotus Notes applications and databases (things like Advisory map, financial reporting applications and work request databases) will not be retired until they have been successfully replatformed — and we’ll give you plenty of notice before that happens. However, in addition to those “high-usage” applications and databases, we’ve also identified thousands of low-user-count applications and databases that may have little business value. On Feb. 28, we will begin turning off access for those low-user-count Lotus Notes applications and databases. After a sufficient period of inactivity, retired applications and databases will be archived and eventually deleted (except those subject to an OGC Legal Hold). But wait! What about the [fill-in-the-blank] application? I need that! Your IT and business leaders have confidence we’ve identified and made plans to replatform the Lotus Notes applications and databases that have business value. However, you can double-check to see whether an application or database you use regularly is scheduled to be turned off: Navigate to this database review tool. If you discover an application or database that needs to be kept beyond Feb. 28, 2019 — including anything subject to an OGC Legal Hold — simply follow the system prompts to request an exception. Your IT leaders will review your request to help you retain the information you need or to replatform to a new system. After Feb. 28, if you realize an application or database that’s been turned off needs to be recovered, you can have it temporarily reactivated by submitting a ticket through PwC’s Service Hub. We’ll provide access for a period of time and help you find a more tech-enabled way to manage related tasks going forward. Still have questions? Visit our Data Remediation page for FAQs, tools and resources to help you find, move and appropriately store any information in Lotus Notes that continues to hold business value. Get help! Visit PwC’s Service Hub for a full list of support options, including one-on-one reservations for IT support. Next steps toward moving away from old systems Replatforming and retiring Lotus Notes applications and databases is an important step — but we also have some other outdated systems that need retiring. Here’s what you can expect as we keep moving forward: This spring, we’ll prepare to turn off (and eventually delete) legacy shared drives. By the end of FY19, we’ll put in place a new 18-month retention period on our current Lotus Notes mailboxes. (In plain English, this means we’ll start automatically deleting Lotus Notes emails when they hit the 18-month-old milestone.) We’ll also introduce similar retention policies for our Google Mail and calendar events -- and lengthier data retention policies for Google Drive, Google Keep, Sites and G+ content. (We’ll give you plenty of notice, but you can start to prepare now by refreshing yourself on our systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration.) Later this year, we’ll be ready to delete everyone’s last Lotus Notes email archive and stop issuing Lotus Notes profiles to new joiners. Remind me: Why are we doing this? The way we approach data as a firm is changing. As part of a multi-year data journey, we’ve implemented robust, modern systems for storing and managing records and for collaboration. At the same time, we’re retiring outdated data storage systems; deleting redundant, obsolete and trivial data; and implementing best-in-class guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle.

Our new One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) has simplified and improved how we get Authorization for Services (AFSs) and deliver nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) as part of the engagement startup process. The AFS process is about to get simpler Our legacy teams (US TSIndependence and AFS SoSRTeam) have combined to form a new team, US AFSReview, which will perform all AFS secondary reviews required by firm policy across all lines of service, starting Sept. 4, 2018. This combined team will ensure compliance with independence rules and policies and is ready to help non-audit engagement teams navigate independence from proposal through execution as efficiently as possible. As part of the Rapid Engage process, the new US AFSReview name will automatically populate as an additional approver on AFS forms for restricted entities, with the exception of Tax. For Tax AFSs and for AFSs initiated outside Rapid Engage, simply add “US AFSReview” as an additional approver on the AFS. For questions, please email US AFSReview. New do-it-yourself guidance on pre-engagement nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) When prospective clients ask PwC to sign a nondisclosure or confidentiality agreement before they’re willing to openly discuss a proposal opportunity or project, this new handy checklist can expedite our decision. If you can check all the boxes on the checklist, partners and principals can sign an NDA without further consultation, though this applies only to pre-engagement agreements, not all NDAs. Otherwise the checklist would need to go to an ecosystem contract specialist. After we are selected and the client engagement letter is signed, engagement letter confidentiality provisions take effect. For questions, connect with an ecosystem contract specialist or your Contracting Risk Management Partner.

Laurel Ostiguy, a Boston-based manager in National Office Services, couldn't ignore her dream of becoming an author any longer. "For a long time I tried to quell the overwhelming urge to write a book, until it basically wrote itself," she said. Laurel always knew she had a story inside her, even as a child. When she found herself with a two-hour, round-trip commute a few years ago, the time was right. "I had plenty of time to think the story through and literally record my thoughts, using my iPhone," she said. "And one day, I just began writing it!" She had help along the way, including advice to self-publish. "A friend introduced me to an author who provided tips on how to network and find an editor, cover designer and photographer," she shared. The more people she spoke with, the more it all seemed to fall into place. "At one point I said to myself, 'I really am doing this,' and just kept going." Her first novel, Last Goodbye, was published in 2015 and took four years to write. It was met with positive acclaim, but not before she hired beta readers to review it. "Beta readers are trained to actually rip a transcript apart to give you the absolute painful truth about your story and your writing," she said. "In my case, the feedback they provided was constructive -- and invaluable. When you get a compliment from them, it's a very big deal." Longing to Be followed in 2016, Lying in Wait comes out later this year and Lessons in Love will be released in 2020. All of her books share an ongoing storyline. "The premise of the series follows the journey of several characters from their freshman year of college through graduation, with lots of twists and turns," she said. How does she find the time to write? "I take advantage of PwC’s flexible work environment and now work from home,” she said. “Without that lengthy commute, I have more flexibility to write in the evenings and on weekends. My husband and two young children are very supportive. I love my job at PwC and I love that I can pursue my dream as an author!" A role model for aspiring authors Book signing gigs are another perk. "I love to encourage young aspiring writers,” she said. “Making connections is what it’s all about.” Laurel also donates her books to libraries and auctions. "Self-publishing is very popular these days, and I really recommend it," she said. This means she covers the cost of proofing, printing and design. The books are printed but also available online for Kindle, Nook, iPhone, Amazon and more. "And it's always a treat to read positive reviews, whether they appear in a local newspaper, on Amazon or even on Instagram," she said. Laurel is thrilled to see her passion come to life. "I used to walk in bookstores and say 'why not me?'" Indeed, why not? Find out more about Laurel and her books at www.laurelostiguy.com. Who’s inspiring you in a unique way?

NOVA’s Gen Z program was focused on an enterprise-wide, multi-year digital transformation. The key objective was to implement SAP cloud solutions, in particular SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP), to restructure the antiquated supply chain and financial planning business processes, modernize the aging IT platform to decrease operational costs and streamline the supply chain to create a completely integrated ecosystem that's transparent to all functions involved. What was our proposed solution for NOVA? Using the Integrated Business Planning (IBP) Integrated Solution, and a BXT delivery method, we proposed a unifying supply chain platform leveraging the “Power or the Firm” with best practices from the IBP Integrated Solution playbook, and input from our strategy, management and technology consulting areas across the US and Canada. To solidify the relationship with NOVA and secure the win, we demonstrated chemical industry thought leadership combined with clear articulation of how PwC’s SAP IBP, IDeA, and SCOOP digital tools would deliver value. During orals, we made NOVA feel comfortable by taking extra time during breaks to walk through PwC’s pre-built digital enablers, helping NOVA understand the experience of working with us. What is Integrated Business Planning Integrated Solution? Integrated business planning (IBP) is a strategy for connecting the planning functions (sales and operations planning) in an organization to align operations and strategy with the organization's financial performance (financial planning and analysis). IBP includes functions such as demand planning, sales revenue planning, inventory optimization, product cost planning, detailed scheduling and operational expense planning. The IBP Integrated Solution team has built a delivery playbook with guidance, tools and templates to leverage, and project plans to help deliver in a repeatable and efficient way. What value will NOVA see using our solution? The Integrated Business Planning Integrated Solution will not only drive a one-time working capital reduction of $23 million for NOVA but also reduce over $1 million in annually recurring expenses. Equally important, this solution will retire the aging supply chain IT tools and create improved cross-functional visibility of key supply chain information. To date, we have already identified $12 million in finished goods inventory reduction opportunities and leveraged PwC’s SCOOP Intelligent Forecasting Platform (IFP) to improve forecast accuracy by greater than 15 percent.

For me, this is also a time to reflect on the events of two years ago and the responsibility we each have to protect and enhance the PwC brand. We must never take for granted that the PwC brand stands for trust. Not all of our engagements are as visible as the Academy Awards, but getting it right the first time is something we all strive for. I was talking to Rick recently about how the team is preparing and he captured this very well. He said, “We are well aware of the attention around our work for the Academy. But just like every PwC team, we want to get it right and deliver quality. It’s a mantra for us -- if we do our job, we’ll do great.” I couldn’t agree more. So, if you’re a movie fan, I hope you’ll have fun on Sunday. But even if you are not, you might get questions from friends, family or clients. We can share our pride in our firm’s role in this worldwide event -- but we shouldn’t comment beyond that. If you are in doubt, remember our values and our professional responsibility not to talk about our clients, and that includes commenting on social media. For example, we should not be posting or commenting on likely winners from among this year's Oscar nominees. I want to thank our team, and all of you, for representing our firm well as we enjoy the excitement of Oscars night.

Let them know Does your Development Team rock? Let them know People Team Nov. 2, 2018 Your Development Team is investing in your success -- whether you’re embracing our Your Tomorrow strategy through Digital Upskilling and Be well, work well or achieving personal career goals. Recognizing your career coach, relationship leader or connectivity partner with a non-monetary award is a meaningful way to show your sincere gratitude for their continued guidance. Say “thanks” today by visiting Real-time recognition. Here are some tips: Be sincere: Express what you are thankful for and what it means to you. Be specific: Give specific examples of what you appreciate about them -- note the connection between the guidance they provided and what you got from it. Make it public: If appropriate, share the award on the Recognition activity feed in the Real-time recognition tool. If you are giving recognition and want it to be private (i.e., not displayed on the Recognition activity feed), change the privacy setting during the recognition process (located below the award message text box). Anyone can give or receive non-monetary recognition and only the recipient will know the difference (the amount is not displayed on the Recognition activity feed). If you’re a relationship leader: Use non-monetary Real-time recognition as a way to recognize your assignees for their digital accomplishments, such as completing a Digital Accelerator milestone or earning a digital badge. See who on your team has given or received recognition by clicking on "My team" within the tool. Remember, everyone thrives at work when they know their contributions matter -- so make gratitude a part of your day, every day.

Remember these FROR rules and Do you work with our individual clients? Remember these FROR rules and other contracting protocols One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 23, 2019 As part of our continuous efforts to support the Tax line of service through regular communications, we are calling attention to the following contract language and policies -- Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR), Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information and Privacy Policy Notices. Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. The Tax Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains links to the templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a Privacy Notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period provides any tax service to a person in a financial reporting oversight role at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a financial reporting oversight role (FROR) in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)). Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Section 7216 consent must be obtained for all tax compliance and consulting engagements for individuals due to the nature of our business operations (e.g., use of GDM resources, third party contractors, back office support, etc.) and if the client requests that we disclose the client's tax return information to their representatives or professional advisors (e.g., the client's legal counsel, secretary, head (or CFO) of family office, etc.). This consent must be obtained prior to disclosing information to third parties. The consent must be signed by the client. Please note that the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information must be obtained annually, including in the case of a multi-year contract. Do not reduce the font size of the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information document below 12 points. This font size is required in order to comply with regulations and procedures under Section 7216. Privacy Policy Notice Tax LOS policy requires that privacy notices be sent to clients when providing individual tax (compliance and consulting) services. The GLBA Privacy Notice must be provided when the client relationship commences. For existing clients, an annual notice must be provided every calendar year. Engagement teams should be sure to use the most current engagement letter templates from the Engagement Letters Index.

For these Tax services, a minimum of two approvals is required: 1. The Primary Approver (the Responsible Partner for your client as listed in CES) that is auto populated by the AFS system (usually the audit partner or the Global Relationship Partner (GRP)), AND 2. "US AFSReview" (GUID = uafsreview001), which you must manually add as a Contact and check the “Approver” box, in order for the team to be notified. (Name changed from “AFS SoSRteam” effective 9/4/18). Remember... If your AFS only includes a .pdf version of the engagement contract, produced using the CREATE for Tax tool, a copy in Word format (.docx) will need to be provided. The following link provides guidance on how to download a .docx (see video: "Need a Draft.docx copy"). Ensure the engagement letter clearly describes the proposed services and the delineation between PwC’s role and the role of the Client. Identify the Client oversight contact and explain how you know this person is both capable and willing to oversee the project. Include this information in the engagement file. For more information: Visit the AFS page for contacts and other useful information. Review the guidance at this link, or email the US AFSReview team at us.afsreview@us.pwc.com, or contact a member of the OFRO Tax team.

To transition to Connect v3, leverage the materials available on Spark, including information on how the SDC can assist, how to explain the change to your client and how to use the new features. After your site is upgraded to Connect v3, remember to mark your v2.7 site as transitioned and purge the site (if the site is not subject to a document preservation hold). Large files (more than 250MB) will be hosted on the Microsoft Azure Cloud. Prior to enabling the large file functionality for your Connect V3 site, you must confirm that no terms have been agreed to with the client that would prohibit use of the cloud, including any terms within the engagement letter or an addendum that require on-premise data hosting or restrict us from sharing data with a 3rd party subcontractor. If your team has agreed to terms that would prohibit use of the cloud, you should not enable large file upload. All files smaller than 250MB continue to be hosted on-premise. Questions or concerns?

If a PwC Member Firm has Accepted the client they are now considered Accepted in the US. The Member Firm Acceptance Confirmation form (“MFAC”) will no longer be required. Additionally, you are no longer required to complete a Restricted Party Screening (“RPS”). All you need to do is be sure all of the equivalent RPS contacts are entered into Salesforce before you move your Opportunity to the Interact stage in Salesforce. The remaining steps will be taken care of for you. Tax contracting requirements remain unchanged The additional Terms and Conditions applicable to US Tax Services must be included in all engagement contracts or addendums thereto where PwC US is providing Services to another PwC network firm as a subcontractor. The additional provisions must be acknowledged by the PwC network firm’s client and returned to PwC US either by being contained in the originally executed engagement contract or signed as an addendum to the executed engagement contract. See Tax MFAC Toolkit link below. Automatic ADS The ADS system has been replaced and you no longer need to manually submit an Adverse Data Search request. Rather, simply enter your C-Suite contacts in Salesforce and mark them as such. Be sure you include all of the details you would have provided via the ADS form in the past. When the C-Suite contacts have been entered and your opportunity is moved to Interact or beyond, the information from Salesforce will be sent directly to the ADS team.

Personal independence Ethics &amp; Compliance Jan. 2, 2019 If you are required to maintain independence, your immediate family’s (spouse/spouse equivalent and dependents’) relationships can impact your personal independence. Here are some examples: Aggregate credit card balances Do you know which financial institutions issue the credit cards you and your immediate family use? Check the back of each credit card to determine the issuer. If you’re a covered person to the issuer: Pay your bill on time without incurring late fees. Keep the aggregate carrying balance (of all cards held by you and your immediate family) with any issuer below $10,000. Watch this short clip about paying attention to those credit cards. Online payment accounts Remember Jasmine from this year’s Annual Independence, Ethics &amp; Compliance training? Ranga, Jasmine’s spouse equivalent, had a PayPal account she used for her fantasy football league and Jasmine was a covered person to PayPal. Certain websites and apps (such as PayPal, and Twinspires) act like digital wallets and hold money “on account.” If you are a covered person, you cannot maintain a balance in these accounts as they are considered “uninsured deposits.” It’s easy to start the discussion with your immediate family. Download and share this quick guide on “Personal Independence at Home.” Also, before providing any services, make sure you (and, by extension, your immediate family) are independent of the client. Remember: You cannot provide any audit services or 10 or more hours of non-audit services to a restricted entity if you have an investment in that entity or an affiliate. When providing services to an unrestricted entity, you cannot begin investing in that entity until six months after you have stopped providing services. You may keep investments previously held before working on the engagement, but you cannot sell or buy shares until the six month cooling off period passes. If you’re not sure of the restriction status or if you’re allowed to provide services, contact the Compliance Resource Center before providing any services. Learn more on the US Ethics and Compliance Personal Independence site or by calling the Compliance Resource Center at 1-877-PwC-Help (877-792-4357), option 5 in the US or 813-351-6491 outside the US. You may also submit a ticket or use the chat feature found on the Compliance Resource Center (CRC) Spark page.

With One Firm spirit and enhanced digital skills, the team delivered holiday cheer to more than 100 children in the community. For many years, PwC Dallas has proudly partnered with the Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center (DCAC), a local nonprofit whose mission is to improve the lives of abused children and provide leadership on child abuse issues. Last September, the Dallas office generously agreed to provide holiday gifts to 130 children as part of DCAC’s Holiday of Hope campaign, donating coats, pajamas, and other items on their wishlists. The campaign helped 2,200 of Dallas County’s most severely abused children during the holiday season. When the team received the children’s wish lists from DCAC in December, they realized the enormity of the project. Hundreds of gifts needed to be donated, organized and delivered -- in two weeks. The team needed a holiday miracle. One Firm spirit makes it happen “We had a lot of work to do with very little time,” said Associate Preston Davison. “We needed to purchase over 400 gifts. The gifts then needed to be sorted by family and child, and delivered to DCAC.” The office came together in true One Firm spirit to make the seemingly impossible task a success. Preston leveraged newly acquired digital skills to facilitate the process. “We started by creating an Amazon Wishlist, and then we leveraged UiPath and Alteryx workflows to track our purchases.” Thanks to the generosity and kindness of our PwC family, all of the items were purchased in just a matter of days. The Deals team alone sponsored 60 of the 130 children. And because kindness is contagious, a local Tax team was inspired to raise an additional $3,000 to sponsor 30 more children in need. “It was an honor to represent PwC when we delivered the gifts,” Preston said. “To see the tears and the smiling faces as we kept bringing in bag after bag of gifts was an incredible experience. I’m glad to have played a part in it.” The Dallas team plans to take part in the Holiday of Hope campaign again in 2019 -- just another example of how they continue spreading kindness to others. Note: Check out the latest episode of our Well, well, well podcast to hear more from our Dallas team on their Holiday of Hope experience. Also, keep sharing the kindness and add to our collective reach here.

Schedule it to send first thing in the morning. Are you a super-planner and want to set up a series of reminder emails to your team? Schedule them in advance. Don’t want to forget birthday greetings? Schedule them while you’re thinking about it. Google Mail’s new Schedule Send feature gives you the option to choose when your email is sent to recipients. Now, you can enjoy even more flexibility: Work on your own schedule, but deliver messages when it works best for your clients and colleagues. Scheduling an email is a cinch. Simply compose your email — but instead of hitting send, select the dropdown menu on the blue Send button. (If you have “Send and Archive” enabled, select the white send button.) Select “Schedule send” and choose the time and date from the pop-up menu. The time you select is local to your PC, so account for any difference in time zones. Taking it mobile To use the Schedule Send function on mobile, it only works in the Gmail app (which you can download from PwC’s App Store). To schedule an email on your mobile device, select the three dots next to the send icon and select “Schedule send.” Where do all the emails go? You’ll find scheduled emails in a folder called “Scheduled” (just under the “Sent” folder). From there, you can cancel or make adjustments to sending details. When working offline, it’s possible to schedule emails to be sent at a later time. However, emails will not be sent until you re-establish connection to the network. This means that if you are working offline on the plane, be sure to schedule emails to be sent after you reconnect to the network.

It’s time to rethink how you manage the data you work with daily. A great place to start is with healthy email management. These tips will help you take control of your email and make it work better for you. Avoid the temptation to use your inbox as your to-do list. Turn off email notifications, which distract from strategic tasks. Instead, designate certain times during the day to focus on email. Be strategic when reviewing your email. Try a quick triage system to delete, archive, take immediate action or “star” a message to handle later. By making decisions the first time you view a message, you’ll move through your email more efficiently. (Refresh on the records management and retention policy.) Set up labels for messages you need for a finite period (for instance, for a specific project). You’ll have quick access while you need it, without clogging up your inbox. And it will be easy to delete or transfer the entire group of emails to the appropriate system of record when the project is complete. (Watch the recent Connect &amp; Learn on mailbox labels.) Become an “inbox zero” hero. Clear out your inbox — and keep it clean. If you’ve got hundreds of emails piled up, try assigning them (temporarily) an “old email” label. You’ll still have easy access while you’re adjusting to your new inbox zero habit. Speaking of storage systems … don’t use email as a filing cabinet. Important info and attachments should be saved to shared environments like Google Drive (for collaboration) or systems of record (for project and client records). Make use of other communication channels like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter when appropriate and in compliance with business rules. Don’t be guilty of sending one-word emails (“Thanks!”), and do think twice before choosing “reply all.” More to know For more strategies to take control of your email, search “email” on Fathom Search. Visit Data remediation @ PwC for more on the steps we’re taking to sunset outdated data-storage systems (like Lotus Notes and shared drives), delete “redundant, obsolete and trivial” data (or “ROT,” like old emails), and put in place new guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle. #PwCUSIT Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/40476.html</url><pwc_title>Show them the money!

A new way to pay our Talent Exchange talent Advisory - test May 30, 2019 In June, we’re launching new functionality in Talent Exchange that will provide you more flexibility in structuring agreements with independent talent. You’ll have the option to offer talent daily and weekly rates, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Today, we're spotlighting Fixed Price. Fixed Price roles allow you to award work based on a total price. When creating the role, you include a number of milestones and / or deliverables with associated descriptions and amounts. Talent can then bid on each item during a pricing event and accept an offer based on the total aggregate price. Take a look at the key benefits and considerations below to learn more! Key Benefits For PwC For Talent Some projects are better suited to paying by milestone/deliverable versus time to complete Know up-front how much a project will cost Financial risk shifts to talent Experienced talent often prefer to structure fixed price arrangements versus distilling their work to an hourly rate Know up-front how much a role will pay and greater insight into what is required to successfully deliver the role Key Considerations As we are asking talent to price all work during a pricing event or before the start of a project, the engagement team must have a conversation with talent regarding the specific details for each milestone or deliverable and fully explain what constitutes successful delivery. (Talent have to acknowledge this conversation as well before participating in a pricing event or accepting an offer.) All delivery details must be captured in a SOW at the project start any modifications to milestones or deliverables must be reflected in the SOW prior to the team updating Talent Exchange. Talent Exchange is NOT the system of record. Engagement Leaders will need to approve offers before they are sent to talent, given the potential magnitude of fixed price amounts. Costs will appear on WIPs as expense disbursements versus hours. If you’ve followed along so far, great work!

Follow 5 steps to analyze per Wait…are these Tax services permissible? Follow 5 steps to analyze permissibility of services One Firm Risk Organization May 23, 2019 Before proposing on or providing services to a restricted client, engagement teams must consider the permissibility of those services, taking into consideration the current restriction status of the client in CES (i.e., SEC, AICPA and/or GIP). In order to help engagement teams assess the permissibility of services, the Statements of Permitted Services ("SOPS") and US Independence Policy ("USIP") were drafted. The SOPS and USIP should be used to determine how to apply PwC’s Independence policies regarding non-audit services to be provided to restricted clients and related entities. In general, an Independence analysis utilizing the SOPS and USIP involves an evaluation of the Independence threats that may arise with respect to a particular service offering and related safeguards that, if implemented, may eliminate or reduce such threats to an acceptable level. All SOPS follow a standard format: Section 1: What this SOPS Covers – describes the services or issues covered in the specific SOPS; Section 2: Application of Global Independence Policy (“GIP”) – provides guidance on what is/is not permitted and/or what is permitted with safeguards for GIP restricted clients; Section 3: Nature of the Independence Threat – provides an analysis of the main threats to PwC’s audit Independence that may arise from the services or issues covered by the SOPS; Section 4: Safeguards – provides guidance as to safeguards that may be applied generally or in specific circumstances to mitigate identified risks to Independence; and Section 5: Supplemental Guidance for SEC-Restricted Entities – provides guidance for SEC restricted clients that is additional to, or different from, the GIP requirements discussed in Section 2 and which must be followed when providing services to SEC restricted clients. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP provide guidance for SEC and AICPA restricted clients that is additional to, and occasionally different from, the guidance contained in the SOPS. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP should be reviewed in connection with the SOPS and followed when providing services to SEC and/or AICPA restricted clients. The following steps provide high-level guidelines on how to use the SOPS and USIP to perform an Independence analysis: Action 1: Confirm that you have identified the appropriate SOPS for the proposed services (a user-friendly SOPS chart has been created and can be used as a starting point in any Independence analysis). Action 2: If providing services to a SEC restricted client, start with Section 5 of the SOPS and Section 7200 of USIP to establish whether the proposed services are permissible per SEC guidelines. If not permissible, you will need to reconsider/restructure the service offering as SEC Independence rules do not permit the implementation of safeguards to eliminate or reduce threats to an acceptable level when providing services to a SEC restricted client. Action 3: If the services are permissible with respect to a SEC restricted client or if the client is AICPA and/or GIP restricted (only), you must verify that the services are permissible per Section 7400 of USIP (for AICPA restricted clients) and/or Section 2 of the SOPS (for GIP restricted clients). Action 4: If the services are permissible, determine the nature of the Independence threats as described in Section 3 of the SOPS and the corresponding safeguards to be applied as described in Section 4 of the SOPS. Action 5: Once the Independence analysis has been documented, engagement teams must include the analysis along with the "Threats and Safeguards Analysis Form" in the "Relevant Policy and Threats and Safeguards" section of the AFS (Authorisation For Services form) for approval by the CES Responsible Partner (and the U.S. AFS Review team, where required). For additional information regarding permissibility, please visit the Independence microsite or contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

As we near the firmwide holiday shutdown and wrap up the calendar year, it’s a good time to pause, reflect and take stock of your progression and performance, as well as your path forward. To help you, here’s a quick checklist: ✔ Development Team: Have you connected with your Development Team? It’s important to have regular check-ins so they can support your career develop and progression. Also, you have until Jan. 1, 2019, to earn Well-Being Rewards for meeting with your Relationship Leader, Career Coach or Connectivity Partner (as applicable). ✔ Snapshots: You should have at least two, acknowledged Snapshots, which capture your progression against the PwC Professional framework. Remember: Aim to have at least 80% of your hours covered at all times. Need help writing a performance differentiator - check this out. ✔ Career Roundtable: It’s not too early to think about Career Roundtable and what actions you can take to show your contributions and impact. Make sure you meet with your relationship leader to discuss opportunities that demonstrate your impact. ✔ Promotion requirements: If you’re eligible for promotion this year, it’s never too early to familiarize yourself with these promotion requirements. If promoted to manager, you’ll need to comply with independence requirements -- the earlier you start, the easier the transition will be! Need more info?

Are you contributing to your Health Savings Account (HSA)? You can start, increase or decrease HSA contributions at any time at Benefits Express Online. And if you’re enrolled in the High or Middle Deductible Plan, PwC puts money in your HSA each pay day. Here are five reasons you should save as much as you can in your HSA. 1. You get triple tax savings. Contributions to your HSA are not taxed. Funds in your HSA grow tax-free. Withdrawals for qualified health care expenses are also tax-free. 2. You don’t lose what you don’t spend. There’s no "use it or lose it" rule for funds in your HSA. Any money you don’t use by the end of the year rolls over to the next year -- and even into retirement. So, you don't have to know what kind of health care expenses you'll incur in order to contribute to an HSA. 3. You HSA dollars earn interest and potentially investment returns. Your HSA cash balance earns interest based on the applicable rate for your balance. Plus, you’re eligible to invest any portion of your HSA balance in excess of $1,000 in available mutual fund options. These options comply with PwC's independence requirements and you don’t need to enter these investments through the Independence Checkpoint system. 4. You can use your HSA for anyone in your family. Use HSA dollars to pay for the qualified medical expenses for anyone you claim on your taxes, even if they’re not enrolled in your medical plan. 5. You can take it with you! Your HSA is portable. It goes with you -- even if you leave PwC. Learn more and earn Well-Being Rewards For more information about HSAs and the benefits of maximizing your contributions, view the online course Using Your Health Savings Account Effectively. When you do, you earn 500 points in the Well-Being Rewards Program.* (Earn up to 1,000 points per quarter for completing online financial well-being courses.

In less than two weeks since launch, over 6,600 Real-time recognition awards have been sent to say “thank you”! Let’s keep the momentum going and make in-the-moment gratitude part of our daily routine. Recognizing others fuels our emotional well-being and aligns with Be well, work well, a vital component of Your Tomorrow. Access Real-time recognition today via myKcurve, the “PwC External Links” worklet in Workday, and in PwC’s App Store via the Globoforce mobile app. As with any new program or tool, Real-time recognition comes with a learning curve, so here are a few quick tips: Budget (if eligible): If you have been allocated an annual budget by your leadership team, half of it was loaded into the system on Sept. 28. The other half will be loaded in January 2019, but you cannot borrow against that budget to use during this first period. Spending balance: This can be seen via PC (not yet in the app) during the recognition process. After clicking “Recognize,” search for the colleague you wish to award, then select the award reason. You will see the screen shown below: Best practice for coaches: Add your coachees to your work circle, which is based on your supervisory organization family in Workday. This allows you to easily track their recognition events. On the Recognition home page, scroll down to activity and click "edit" next to "My work circle" to add people. To delete someone from your work circle, click “x” next to their name. Recognition activity feed: If you choose the “shared” privacy setting, your award reason and message will appear on the Recognition activity feed. Only the award recipient will know if the award is monetary or non-monetary. Note: Do not share client names, confidential information or any comments outside of our Code of Conduct in your recognition message or if you congratulate others in the Recognition activity feed. If client names are included, the administrators will make the award private. Have additional questions? Visit the Real-time recognition site. Stay tuned… We’ll announce the winners of our launch contest soon! Need technical support? Our vendor, Globoforce, offers 24/7 customer service phone support. Simply click the Contact Us button in the top right of any page within the Real-time recognition platform. A live representative will assist you with any functionality, award or redemption-related issues.

We pay attention to how we entertain our own people, too. Our partners have these policies in place to help us protect our brand and the firm by keeping our expenses accurate and transparent. But you might be surprised when our new system requires compliance by asking for more details than in the past. First, make sure you know the basics. Watch SAP Concur’s 90-second video tutorial on adding attendees to a business meal: Expense system pro tips: Speed up entering attendees for group meals and entertainment Don’t type the same names over (and over) again. With our integrated systems and a few shortcuts, the details you need are no further than a search away: If your group meals frequently include the same people, create a group -- and quickly populate the details for these events in the future. Client information is fed into our expense system from Salesforce, so a quick search by either the client’s name or company will populate their details. And if the client isn’t already listed in the expense system, enter just the first and last name, title and organization -- and consider that your reminder to get them added to Salesforce! If you’re expensing a large group meal, but it’s just PwC employees, check out this shortcut. As long as you input the correct total number of attendees you don’t have to worry about providing detailed information for more than six PwC people. More to know Want more pro tips?

The results reflect continued improvement in certain areas as a result of everyone’s collective efforts; however, the total number of audits addressed in the report reflects an increase of two compared to the prior year. We can be pleased with the areas of improvement, but our overall results reflect the need to maintain a priority focus on driving further improvements in audit quality. The PCAOB oversees auditors of public companies, and in doing so annually inspects our audit performance and related quality controls. When the PCAOB issues a report on a firm, it’s in two parts: Part I is posted to the PCAOB’s website, and Part II is shared with the inspected firm and focuses on their system of quality control. The PCAOB has now posted Part I of our 2017 inspection report on its website.

For many, the question of what happens to that business after the owner retires is fraught with challenges. Charlie Carr and Belinda Sneddon, Managing Directors in PwC's US Family Enterprise Advisory Services group, share their insights from working with family business owners on continuity and succession planning challenges. After working hard to establish their businesses, how well are family business owners planning to preserve their wealth and legacy for future generations? Belinda: There is so much focus on establishing and growing the business that owners often are not thinking about continuity planning. It’s interesting because the characteristics that make them so good at building their business may be the same ones that make it so hard for them to bring others into the decision making and management processes. This is an area where family business owners could benefit from guidance around the need for appropriate planning, communication, and execution. Charlie: Unfortunately, we see many first generation family members who don't have answers for the next generation — and don't want to discuss it. This may be the worst possible response, as they need to be more strategic so they can identify shortcomings and develop ways to address them. What are some of the biggest issues related to continuity and succession planning? Charlie: First generation businesses are often run by a controlling owner. In the second and third generations, siblings or cousins may need to work together. Each family member has different skills, interests, and goals. While some may be competing to run the company, others might be uninvolved and more concerned about distribution levels. So families need to balance these different interests. Belinda: Communicating these plans is something that many families find challenging. Where communication is missing or weak, the resulting lack of transparency can cause rifts in the family and problems for the business. Even where communication is strong, it is important not to assume awareness equates to acceptance/buy-in. Charlie: At the end of the day, families need to have a governance model that evolves as they move across generations because the model that worked for the prior generation may not work for the next one. What steps do you recommend families take to set up for long-term success? Charlie: During the upcoming Continuity and Succession Planning webinar on September 19th, Belinda and I will talk about three key steps that family business should take related to strategy, communication, and execution.

We covered a lot of information -- resource links are included below, but please watch the replay for the most comprehensive review of our Tax CRT process and rewards strategy. To watch the replay, go to the PwC webcast portal and select “Tax CRT &amp; Comp webcast” under April 24. A few highlights and reminders As Tim Ryan recently communicated and as Roy mentioned in our Tax Town Hall, if our One Firm results stay on track (and we believe they will), we’ll increase the annual performance bonus pools up to an additional 10% so we have additional dollars to recognize our people for their individual contributions and impact. The final decision will be made once we complete the review of the financial results, so let’s make every effort to finish the FY strong. Note: This does not mean that individual bonuses will increase by 10%. It means your leaders will potentially have a larger pool of funds that will be allocated based upon business needs. As an example, it could be allocated by market, business unit and/or impact. To prepare for your Career Roundtable discussion, review your Snapshots to assess how you are progressing along the PwC Professional framework, as well as the impact you had for the year, which come through the differentiators. For promotion candidates, be aware of the promotion requirements for your level and team and set aside time now to meet the various deadlines. Review key metrics via myMetrics as well as your TalentLink profile/schedule. (For our manager promotion candidates, Talentlink is where we look for your logged credentials.) Plan ahead! Have regular touch points with you career coach and RP to discuss your career goals, your deployment interests, learning needs, your metrics, Snapshots, as well as progression and development throughout the year. ...and remember, we continue to invest in you! Through programs such as Be well, work well, Digital Fitness, the Digital Accelerator program and our new family leave benefits, we are making an investment in your future to help you learn, grow and care for your family when you need to.

Our goal is to help you and your teams better understand how we’re moving toward Your Tomorrow with a continued focus on the quality of our execution. If you were unable to attend the webcast, you can watch the replay here -- and read this summary to see what we covered and access helpful resources: For those who are heading into busy season, it’s important to remember that quality is our number one priority and foundational to all we want to accomplish in our strategy. For easy reference, we’ve put together this slide with links to recent Audit Advisors that may be helpful for your engagements. Our Digital Accelerators may have jumpstarted our progress, but we all have the opportunity and obligation to use our new digital skills and look for ways to simplify, standardize and automate processes as appropriate. With the launch of Digital Lab last week, I encourage all of you to use it. Check out what’s already on there, and submit your own automations. Digital upskilling is a process -- setting aside a little time each week will add up. Additional upskilling resources can be found in the Digital Hub, including access to the four Digital Quests you’ll need to complete by the end FY19 to earn your Digital Acumen Knowledge Badge. Your first Digital Quest is due on December 31. Use our tools &amp; technology, like Engagement Center and My Independence Assessment, on your engagements, and leverage relevant TEA resources. They can help you continue to enhance quality and gain process efficiencies at the same time. With the recent transition to Workday, we’ve made a few changes to how we’re asking you to document CPA and non-CPA credentials. You can find your specific requirements and additional information here. Updates and reminders for the next few months are summarized here. And as we head into busy season I have two asks: 1.) Remember to stay committed to your Be well, work well plans -- encourage and support the goals of every member of your team; and 2.) continue to practice real-time development by scheduling time to connect with your coach -- ask for feedback! Thank you for all that you do, and have a Happy Thanksgiving!

"After joining PwC in 2014, and relocating from Connecticut to Chicago, I was living large, literally, enjoying everything city life had to offer, including dining out every night in fancy restaurants," he said. But the good times left their mark when Matthew stepped on that scale and reality set in. "I thought it must be defective,” he said. “I was 40 pounds over what I thought I weighed.” That startling moment propelled him to make a complete lifestyle change. He joined a gym, hired a personal trainer, and began eating healthier and tracking his food every day. It didn’t take long to start seeing results. "I was encouraged by my progress and stayed on course, including bringing healthy snacks and lunches to work, limiting restaurant meals and continuing these good habits even when traveling for work," Matthew said. His loss, his gain Inevitably, the scale went down, and down. "I lost a total of 90 pounds over the span of about three years," he said. He was even featured in his gym's "Transformation Tuesday" promotional campaign. Matthew also realized he was already living the principles of Be well, work well in many ways, and began following the suggestions outlined in the Habit Bank to stay energized. "I'm glad the firm is committed to well-being; it’s so important to our success and our people," he said. He focuses on mental and spiritual energy through yoga, reading and being more aware of his spirituality in general. Matthew's team is supportive of his dramatic journey, and they all enjoy sharing tips. "We have an Instagram account for The habit challenge. We call ourselves “Energizin’ is a Habit, Get Like Me,’” he said. They have committed to "stepping away from the screen" and "hydrating your mind." "My team pushes me to continue to be a champion of living a healthy lifestyle," he said. Matthew also takes advantage of the Well-Being Rewards program by logging his gym time, nutritionist visits, yearly physicals and more -- banking his rewards all year. "I use them to get my wife an extra Christmas present," he said. He's also a member of PwC Chicago’s Health and Wellness Committee, which promotes many of the practices of The habit challenge. For those struggling with weight issues, Matthew has a message: "It can be done -- I am proof. Despite the hours, client dinners, happy hours and travel, it’s still possible to live a healthy lifestyle and meet the demands of our clients. Good habits take time to take hold; don't get discouraged. And please contact me if I can help." Oh, and pizza and ice cream are not off limits. "I still indulge,” Matthew said. "But it's the exception now, not the rule." Do you have a Be well, work well story to share? Let us know! And don't forget the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge -- if we meet our goals, we’ll get the entire July 4 week off!

Avoid buyer’s remorse Engaging a third party supplier? Avoid buyer’s remorse Ethics &amp; Compliance March 27, 2019 Consider this scenario: You want to impress your client with a new presentation tool. You find the perfect tool online and it's only $20 a month! You grab your AMEX*, agree to the terms, and you're done. Would you have made this purchase if you knew this tool sends confidential client data that is in your presentation back to the software company? Or that the company’s owner is allegedly accused of patent infringement and trade-secret theft? Oh, and you missed the part that the version you purchased is only for personal use, not for business use. Sounds scary, right? It should. Certain suppliers present higher risk to the firm, and it is critical that we perform the proper due diligence before we contract with such suppliers. The Supplier Risk Management Program, part of the Procurement process, helps you proactively identify and mitigate risks -- like the ones identified in the scenario above. What you should do when engaging a supplier Make sure you submit your request to Procurement through Request It if your supplier request meets any one of the following conditions: The supplier may have access to, process or host client or firm information. The contract or purchase value may be greater than or equal to $50,000 ($10,000 for contract or purchases initiated in Mexico). The software may be used by, with or resold to clients (including being incorporated into client deliverables or market facing offerings). Be sure to reference the “When to Engage Procurement” section of the Procurement policy as soon as you think you might need a supplier as the policy may be updated throughout the year. *Purchasing software or IT services using a corporate AMEX credit card is prohibited by the firm. Be sure to submit requests for software not available in Software Installer or Software Center by submitting a request using the IT Request Form.

Get to know our Drafting your next engagement letter just got easier. Get to know our newest tool: Create One Firm Risk Organization July 30, 2018 Create, our engagement letter creation system, is now available for all lines of service. Create makes drafting engagement letters, statements of work and other deliverables simpler, using a questionnaire structure to pull in the right firm-approved language. Built on the Exari platform, the system is easy to use and eliminates the need to edit our previous Word-based templates. We piloted Create across the firm and the feedback has been resoundingly positive. Along with DocuSign ,the electronic signature platform that also launches firmwide today, the shift underscores our firmwide strategy to simplify our internal process as well as become digital in all that we do as we improve the experience for our clients in these key contracting interactions. Create can help you by: Saving time and cost in preparing and reviewing documents -- giving you time back in your day Enhancing accuracy and quality -- helping you produce the right document in the right format at the start of the process Lowering risk by reducing the potential for manual errors Simplifying reviews by tracking and displaying any manual changes made to the template language When and how can I start using Create? Create is now available for all US lines of service. The tool will be available for Mexico engagement letters, statements of work and some deliverables later this fiscal year. Our Create site has all the materials you’ll need to get started, including FAQs, demo videos and quick reference guides for Assurance and Advisory users. Tax users will continue to access “Create for Tax” through Engagement Center, or from the OFRO Tax (formerly Tax Q&amp;RM) Engagement Letters microsite. How does Create work? Our Create team combed through all the language in existing Word templates, including underlying footnotes, to build a contracting platform that’s easier to use and maintain. All of those pesky footnotes that required reading and editing have been transformed into questions in the system that you answer with the click of a button. No more wording changes, wrestling with footnotes, or changing fonts and colors. To put that effort in perspective: For Assurance alone, the Create team reviewed each of the 60+ Assurance templates available in US Template Manager -- more than 5,000 paragraphs of text. We standardized the language Create will use to build your draft to fewer than 400 paragraphs. All data entered in Create can also be data-mined by the new One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO), ASM&amp;T and OGC for better risk management decisions, and all letters are stored centrally for easy access. Create for Tax currently integrates with DMS when used with Engagement Center. Executed tax letters from clients are automatically filed to DMS as they are returned. Integration with Aura is also planned to allow Assurance to upload completed letters to the EGAs seamlessly. Additional capabilities include: Document access is automatically set using the underlying engagement acceptance forms contained in the A&amp;C system. Partners and Managers on the EAFs are granted rights to their own client content. For Assurance engagements, access is also guided by Aura rights. Additional drafters can be added manually, giving you the flexibility to add team members directly to a document, without impacting A&amp;C or Aura. For staff who transition to other engagements, real-time adjustments will carry through to the system, automatically adjusting their access. Create will store seven years of content in the system, in accordance with our data retention policy. What’s next for Create? The team is already at work to bring other streamlined documentation onto Create for late 2018, including opinions, memos, SEC services documents, comfort letters and more. Create is also built for integration with other new technologies the firm is rolling out to simplify the client acceptance and engagement startup processes. Coming later this summer, the new Rapid Engage tool will help you get from opportunity identification to WBS code release faster. And Create will be integrated with DocuSign, our new electronic document signing system in late 2018. Have feedback or ideas for enhancing Create? Provide them here for consideration.

Lauren, a Global Human Resource Solutions Tax associate, didn’t let being new to the firm (or the working world) stop her from taking digital fitness into her own hands. She taught herself Alteryx and developed a solution that’s now saving hundreds of hours of work and opening up the door to new client opportunities.

Lauren Bauer: We knew there had to be a way to easily compare the publicly available data on benefits and pension plans that all companies file with the Department of Labor through a Form 5500. The information was out there, but no one had organized it or figured out an automated way to analyze it that would offer insights to current and potential clients. How did you approach it and what results have you seen? We had an idea that there might be a way to use technology to streamline the process, and I was excited to explore it more. With guidance from our resident Alteryx “ninja” Ming Fang, I worked in my spare time to build my knowledge of Alteryx and Tableau, and designed a tool that would allow us to compare companies’ data. My team, and my manager in particular, trusted me to teach them the new technology as we went along -- even as they were reviewing my work. They trusted me to guide them, even though I was the most junior person on the team. Now, work that would have taken hundreds of hours can now be done in a few minutes, allowing our team to focus on the analysis. We’re starting to identify companies that would benefit from working with us, and, as a result, already have two wins under our belt. What inspires you to make an impact on your team and PwC more broadly? Being new to the firm, I was excited to bring something to the table for my team. I love learning new things and exploring new tools -- before this project, I didn’t know what a Form 5500 was! I take pride in solving problems. Internally, this meant figuring out how we can create and use better tools and then externally, for our clients, how we can use public data to solve a problem. I feel that, in general, the firm can learn a lot by looking to new people who don’t know how things were done before. These are the people who have a fresh perspective on how to approach challenges, leading to new ways of doing things that are more efficient for everyone. To learn more about Lauren’s winning Alteryx / Tableau solution and how you could apply it to your engagement, contact Lauren, Kristin Harel or Michael Cardillo. In support of Your Tomorrow, the Tax practice is accelerating the journey to digitize work, enabling staff at all levels to focus on developing critical digital, tax technical and consultative skills and spend more high-value time with clients. Lauren’s successful use of technology to dramatically streamline work for her engagement embodies the purpose of this strategy, known as Digitizing Tax: Project 5 Million. To support the strategy, Tax has created an interactive community that houses our colleagues’ data workflows, visualizations and BOTS in a single, easily accessible location. The community will facilitate seamless collaboration among users. Stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks about this community -- and in the meantime, get a head start by taking the on-demand self-service analytics trainings, available here on Digital Hub. Our purpose as a firm is to build trust in society and solve important problems. Those problems can be large or small -- sometimes all it takes is a fresh pair of eyes and a different approach to find the one that you’ll solve. No matter what our role, we all have opportunities to go above and beyond to deliver our work and find meaning in what we do every day. How does our purpose resonate with you?

Such engagements include the following: Tax provision preparation or review Accounting for uncertain tax positions Tax accounting performance improvement GHRS Pension/OPEB valuation, stock-based compensation accounting or deferred tax related services (ASC 712, 715, 718 and/or 740). Because of the risk profile of such engagements, tax engagement teams should be aware of the risk management protocols to help teams mitigate the risks on these engagements. One such protocol requires that all tax accounting service engagements for non-audit clients be approved by a TAS Market Leader or a GHRS Accounting Services Leader. In addition, tax accounting service engagements that have been designated as high risk require OFRO Tax approval and the approval and active involvement of a Concurring Partner (“CP”) with tax accounting experience. Effective 11/7/2018, all non-restricted (C2) Tax provision review/preparation engagements are required to be restricted in DMS (see the Policy: Confidentiality and DMS access). All approvals should be obtained during the engagement acceptance process and prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. Engagement teams should select the characteristics that apply to the engagement when completing the A&amp;C engagement acceptance assessment to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained during the Engagement Acceptance process. When providing tax accounting services for non-audit clients, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check restriction in Salesforce (or Central Entity Service (“CES”)) to determine if client is a non-audit client If a non-audit client, initiate the engagement acceptance assessment in A&amp;C Obtain TAS/GHRS leader approval and, if applicable, OFRO Tax and CP approvals Execute engagement contract Begin work For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that a different approval process applies to engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients. Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. Name, rank, serial number? I'm Anne Donovan, Managing Director and US People Experience Leader, based out of the Los Angeles office. I’ve been with the firm for 34 years; I’m retiring in January 2020. What's a typical day for you? I travel 60% of the time; when I’m home you can find me on the phone, wearing sweats or PJs, under the watchful gaze of Margaret, my Labradoodle, who is basically a PwC employee at this point. We take lots of walking meetings together. I’m either discussing Be well, work well with our external clients who want to bring it to their organizations, or taking the pulse of our staff to understand how our People initiatives are resonating with them. Engaging with our people by asking how they are feeling about their life at the firm and how we can help them is my main focus every day. How did your journey lead you to this role? I joined client service right out of college, spending two years in Assurance as an auditor before joining Tax for three years and then the Tax Human Capital team, which was called Personnel at the time. From that point onward it’s been total Human Capital immersion! I got involved with anything that fell under the Human Capital umbrella -- whether from a local, regional or xLoS standpoint. My role just kept evolving! A Human Capital strategy role in Assurance led to working on Transformation and now here I am. How does your team bring value to PwC? Through listening to what our people need! Ten years ago, thanks to focus groups and interviews throughout the firm, we learned that our people had a burning desire for a more flexible work environment. The firm took that feedback and ran with it, ultimately changing our culture to be more flexibility friendly -- think jeans, flex days and Virgin Plus rewards! Our team is relentless; whenever the firm goes through a cultural change, like launching Be well, work well, we figure out how it will affect everyone, including what works and what doesn’t. We want to know what our people are thinking and feeling to create a better and more consistent experience. Programs like Be well, work well are changing how we work every day! What are your plans for retirement? Two words: road trip! As soon as I retire I’m taking my siblings on a trip from California to Nova Scotia -- and all spots in between! Thanks to extensive firm travel I’ve seen a lot -- but mostly hotel rooms, airports and meeting rooms. Soon I’ll have time to see the sights and spend it with my family -- I’m so excited! I told my siblings it’s going to be like a “hop on, hop off” bus -- and if we see a town we like we can stay for awhile – maybe even for a few months. If anyone gets bored they can go home and even rejoin us again later. I’m also a huge baseball fan – and I love to play softball; I’m hoping to join a team when I retire.

You may need to update your BSP account Changes in your personal life? You may need to update your BSP account Ethics &amp; Compliance June 12, 2019 Tagged News Maintaining your securities in the firm’s Brokerage Simplification Program (BSP) is an ongoing responsibility for anyone required to maintain an Independence Checkpoint portfolio -- for you and your family. If you don’t use Independence Checkpoint, this doesn’t apply to you. Stay mindful of events that can affect your independence and require you to manually update BSP account information, including: Changes to your brokerage account, or if you or someone in your immediate family opens a new brokerage account. If your spouse changes jobs, they’ll need to roll over their 401(k) or other employee benefit plan into an IRA or to their new employer’s plan. Getting married or moving in with a significant other (“spouse equivalent”), meaning their brokerage accounts also need to be recorded in Independence Checkpoint. BSP will not automatically account for these types of changes, so you’ll need to record any new accounts and update revised account numbers to maintain your personal independence. Rollovers must be completed within 90 days, and any new accounts or account number changes must be registered in Independence Checkpoint as soon as possible. Our Ethics &amp; Compliance BSP team is here to help. If you have questions visit BSP on Spark or reach out to the Compliance Resource Center (CRC) -- click to chat or call 1-877-PwC-HELP, option 5. Outside the US, call 1-813-351-6491.

You can now offer Daily, Weekly rates, and Incentive fees on time-based roles, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Review the prior PwC Inside articles to learn more about all of the new features, have your burning questions answered in the FAQs, or log in now to see for yourself. As promised, we also have some winners to announce. But first, some of our favorites from the use cases submitted: Fixed Price In video production, we usually hire a "one-man-band" who does it all. They should be paid by deliverable, not hour, which is even more important when the review process gets delayed. Fixed rate requires pristine clarity and proven work experience/trust, so it’s beneficial that scope, deliverables, detailed tasks, are locked down and understood, upfront. Daily/Weekly Rates Allow manageable rounds of revisions and communications with minimal risk of budget overruns. Some resources may take longer to complete tasks in order to increase billable hours, so daily/weekly rates provide TE resources more rate consistency, allow them additional work/life balance and help PwC teams better manage budget. Incentive Fees Sometimes after working with an individual contractor, we find that he or she is an even better fit than first expected. We can reward them with additional project scope (which they may not want) but the fee could incentivize them to take it on. We received a lot of great use cases on how to use the new features, but a few had to win out... So congratulations to: Eugene Grib Michele Lewin Megan Townsend Jeremy Wortzman Michael Gadebusch Thank you again to everyone who submitted ideas! Official contest rules here.

We’ve got automation ideas, yes we do...how about you? Advisory - test June 14, 2019 Earlier this spring, Advisory leadership approached six account teams with a simple challenge in the spirit of our Your Tomorrow strategy: to share their brightest ideas to innovate delivery across some of our largest and most complex engagements. In just three weeks, more than 340 authors submitted over 60 original ideas (talk about a lot of “light bulb” moments!). Submissions were evaluated by members of the Digital Lab team on the basis of hours saved, improved delivery quality, and potential uses in other areas of the firm and Advisory. At the end of May, three lucky teams were given the opportunity to pitch their ideas live in front of US &amp; Global Advisory Leader Mohamed Kande and Advisory Managing Partner Ted Young. Here’s what their view of the future looks like: Automated Controls Monitoring Solution - Microsoft account team (Point of Contact: Matt Hobbs) The Microsoft account team saw an opportunity to automate the monitoring of certain internal controls that are performed frequently and often manually across an organization. This center of controls automation would be leveraged to reduce errors, learn the patterns by function, provide insights, and move away from offshore delivery performing costly low value added activities. CECL Insights Big Data Visualization Engine - Citi account team (Point of Contact: Jai Sinha) The Citi account team thought there had to be a better way to harness all of the data used to support decision making for our financial services clients. This solution leverages a data visualization tool to mass produce standardized charts and tables based on data passed automatically from another software application. The payoff? Efficiently producing the approximately 30 table and 40 charts that constitute a single deliverable document, each with varying fonts, axes, and formats. Agile Hygiene Resolver - Southwest account team (Point of Contact: Chuck Christensen) The Southwest Airlines account team was tired of inefficiencies related to management of their Agile sprints. Their proposed automation would leverage data from their Agile program management tool, Jira, to cut down the time required to analyze the health of each team’s Agile sprints. The solution would employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to evaluate things like how long a user story has been in each swimlane of a kanban board, if there is missing metadata, how long each size of story should be in each swimlane, and if large stories are at risk of delivery, to improve decision making and automate routine task maintenance. While these solutions are in varying stages of development, one thing is clear - these ideas have applications well beyond the scope of these specific accounts. If you are interested in learning more about the status of one of these ideas, reach out to the account team contacts noted above. And if you’re interested in seeing an example of another idea already brought to life in the Digital Lab, take a look at the following video. It showcases how one team in the Advisory made use of new features rolled out in Digital Lab last month to completely change the way they perform a certain type of analysis on their projects. Have your own great idea about how to leverage Digital Lab assets to transform client delivery? Stay tuned for an expanded Advisory Idea Contest rolling out in the month of July. Your bright idea could be one of several selected to be built out with help from the PwC Labs team during our Advisory “hack-a-thon”!

Advisory - test June 14, 2019 As discussed over the last two Fridays, Talent Exchange functionality coming later this month will allow you more flexibility in structuring agreements with independent talent. You’ll be able to offer Daily and Weekly rates on time-based roles, along with Fixed Price arrangements to support milestone and deliverable-based work. Today, learn about how to leverage incentive fees. After onboarding talent for a time-based role, you will have the option to amend the engagement to include a one-time incentive fee for each project. This amendment will require approval from the role’s Engagement Leader and they will have to confirm they’ve had an offline conversation with their Vertical Operations Leader approving the payment. Once the amendment is approved, talent will be able to submit the incentive payment through their project’s regular T&amp;E portal. Like all submitted T&amp;E, it will need to be approved by the engagement manager. Take a look at the key benefits and considerations below to learn more! Key Benefits For PwC For Talent Additional tool to incentivize talent Could be used to motivate work completion in a shorter duration, retention of talent for an additional project phase Additional revenue source for increased efforts. Key Considerations This feature can only be used one time for time-based roles and is intended to be used infrequently. Incentive fees require offline approval from the team’s Vertical Operations Leader and will appear on WIPs as expense disbursements. If multiple talent are working together on one project, please keep this in mind when considering an incentive fee for an individual. Given tax implications, individuals in MBO Partners’ Payroll Services are not eligible for incentive fees. Payroll Services contractors are identified by “Hourly Projects Only” on their talent card. Still with us? Great work! Submit a way in which you think an incentive fee can benefit / be used on your project for a chance to win a $50 Amazon gift card. Again, the more questions you answer, the better your chances of winning! You can still answer questions from previous weeks to increase your odds. See the official contest rules here.

The boxes were packed with items meant to bring a moment of joy to the families while their child is being treated at a nearby hospital. The team delivered the packed boxes, along with special notes, to siblings and parents who were beyond grateful for the generosity. One mother was excited to use the items to decorate her son’s room and one of the siblings really enjoyed the stuffed frog in his box.

Office Depot is an industry leader in the office products retail space. However, the changing retail model from big-box to online has led to significant revenue and EBITDA pressure. To reinvent their business, and maintain their dominant industry position, Office Depot is transforming into a business services company -- accelerated by the acquisition of CompuCom, a leader in the IT services and business management space. This acquisition, and services-oriented transformation, is turning Office Depot’s business upside down. Rather than the retail outlet serving as the business generator for sales, they are shifting focus to enterprise business relationships serving as the sales catalyst, with Office Depot office products as a ‘pull through.’ Both Office Depot and CompuCom were running on Oracle’s on-premise Enterprise Business Suite (EBS) as independent businesses. To enable the business transformation, they invested in Oracle Cloud ERP, Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) and Human Capital Management (HCM) product suites. In the new world, Office Depot and CompuCom need to become unified with the implementation of Oracle Cloud platform. What was our proposed solution for Office Depot and how did we win? With our One Firm approach, PwC brought the best of our Fit for Growth (FFG) platform strategy and approach with the Finance Transformation Integrated Solution to design a compelling proposal for the Office Depot business and technology transformation. We demonstrated our expertise and differentiation through a live prototype testing phase based on PwC’s preconfigured Oracle Cloud model system, which leverages our expertise and learnings from previous clients in the same sector to streamline configuration of a blank Oracle environment with settings that drive industry specific leading practices. This was a key accelerator of the Finance Transformation Integrated Solution. Office Depot saw this as a differentiator from our competition and a significant value add to their success. We provided a clear vision of what we could deliver and how we are best suited to enable Office Depot’s business and technology evolution. Our One Firm team demonstrated deep technical and business acumen, knowledge and expertise in delivering comparable solutions for other clients. We were seen as innovative, as exemplified by the parallel General Ledger approach, the model system to expedite process design, and the automated PMO tool. What results will Office Depot see using our solution? Report rationalization: relying on out-of-box reporting and Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence resulted in 70% reduction of hours in custom reporting. Overall reduction of 14K hours per year and consolidation of multiple data warehouse systems. We helped Office Depot develop a comprehensive business case and cloud application roadmap strategy with anticipated benefits of $22-30M per year. Streamlined ‘Contracts to Cash’ process and system optimization using Oracle Cloud. Consumption-based billing and consolidated invoicing, helping Office Depot /Compucom build a more efficient order and delivery model. By deploying the Oracle Cloud Project Portfolio Management (PPM) Cloud Solution, we increased the speed of contract creation by 30%, which will result in 5%-7% improvement in bottom line profit. What was significant about this win for us? Rebuilt a strained relationship with Office Depot by leveraging the support of our CREs. Significant xLoS collaboration and teamwork with the use of Tax, organizational change management and Acceleration Centers (formerly called SDCs). Example to include with submission for an Oracle Excellence Award and a significant investment in Oracle alliance partnership, with stories to tell together within the marketplace to support future transformations leveraging our Integrated Solutions. Leveraged our global Oracle practice and their Office Depot relationships to continue expanding the client’s Oracle Cloud footprint including successful past implementations in the Netherlands and Hong Kong. Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

Are you ready? The July 4 shutdown is almost here. Are you ready? Advisory - test June 25, 2019 With the excitement of the July 4 shutdown upon us, we know you’re looking forward to some well-deserved time off! But first, we need your help to fulfill our commitments to our people, clients, and firm. Here are five key things to do this week to make sure we end FY19 strong and start FY20 even stronger: 1. Enter and synchronize your time: Entering your time daily is important every day -- but it’s especially important at the end of the fiscal year. Ensure all of your time is accurately entered and synchronized no later than Friday, June 28 by 8:00 p.m. ET. We need everyone to deliver the hours committed within FlexForecast/TalentLink for Advisory and our firm to achieve budget. 2. Complete your Digital Quests: While there are a number of ways to get digitally upskilled, we’ve all been working toward one common goal -- to earn our Digital Acumen knowledge badges by June 30. If you haven’t completed all four digital quests, now is the time! 3. Keep Salesforce opportunities current: Salesforce is a big driver of our forecast -- we use it to make business decisions on staffing and investments, and we need accurate data to get July off to a strong start. Please update your Salesforce opportunities with the latest amount, stage, close date, and start/end dates. 4. Ensure FlexForecast ETCs are current: Last month, we discussed how we’re renovating FlexForecast, and we continue to make progress in improving its performance and stability. Reach out to your Vertical Finance Teams with any concerns; they can help guide you through the latest enhancements. We appreciate your continued patience as we get Flex operating again like the exceptional tool that it is. 5. Set your out of office and disconnect! Checklist complete? You’re all set to relax and recharge. Have a great break!

We’re talking more than 250 ideas submitted by YOU in a span of mere weeks. What’s more, these submissions have come from across every one of the Advisory verticals and Go to Market teams, showing that automation potential isn’t limited to just one area of our business.

Utilities Rate Testing Bot - Automates the process for rates configuration/billing testing within Oracle or SAP billing systems, reducing data review time and risk of manual error or material discrepancy; offers potential savings of up to 400 hours every time automation is run (12x/month). Automated Salesforce Configuration Workbook - Automates the process of pushing Salesforce design/configuration inputs from a workbook directly into the Salesforce environment without having to configure through the UI; offers potential savings of 4 hours every time automation is run (100x/month). Deals Diligence Automation Suite - An end-to-end suite of tools to automate much of the deals diligence process, including data intake and processing workflows and standard visualization packages that can be produced in hours vs. weeks; offers potential savings of 30 hours every time automation is run (10x/month). Congrats to the team behind the Salesforce configuration workbook, who won the “golden ticket” with more than 40% of the audience vote!

By now, you’ve heard from your Business Unit Leaders about Digital Insights -- a big helping hand that will make it easier for us to choose and implement the right solutions for our engagements. Getting started is easy, and takes only five to ten minutes at the start of engagement planning. But once you’ve taken the first step, and created a plan what should you do next? It’s as simple as getting your team together over some pizza -- or a Google hangout. Set aside time to pause, reflect and plan as a team before the start of a project. Talk with each other about the solutions you’ve laid out, what might be missing and what the impact of those solutions might be. The agenda can be loose and free-flowing -- but what’s important is that everyone has a voice. Want to take your lunch meeting to the next level? Invite a Digital Accelerator, or conference in a team member from the Acceleration Centers (formerly GDM). Your colleagues are already putting Digital Insights plans into action, starting with low-key virtual and/or in person lunch meetings or Google hangouts. Discuss all the possibilities for how you can deliver differently, without sacrificing Quality. Consider discussing topics such as: Your staffing mix and staffing levels - who might you free up? How can we better leverage alternative labor? The number of reviews the engagement requires How you can best leverage Acceleration Centers and Digital Accelerators Connecting the dots on FlexForecast/TalentLink Getting the right value for the services we deliver, by using the Smart Pricing Tool How we can better deliver the Client Experience and the tech-enabled service our clients want?

The OFRO Tax self-study series is required for associates, senior associates, and managers hired before 1/1/18 and associates - managing directors hired after 1/1/18 and should be completed within the timeframe noted on Tax Source or prior to promotion to the next staff level. As a reminder, for staff who were promoted on 7/1/19, OFRO promotion requirements are due on 11/27/19. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators that oversee our profession, as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the OFRO Tax expectations are for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients supported by documentation in DMS and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility. Completion requirements: OFRO Tax self-study series should be completed within the timeframe specified. Visit Tax Source for a list of course completion requirements by staff level and hire date. Promotions to the next staff level carry a OFRO Tax training completion requirement in FY20, similar to the annual CPE requirement. Note to Managers &amp; above: On July 30, a number of the courses were deactivated from the Manager and above curricula and new versions are currently being developed. Those impacted by these changes were notified via email on July 11. We will deploy new versions as they are completed, beginning in August.

Focused on driving Your Tomorrow - Project 5 Million goals, Tax director Abe Sedgh and his team took a fresh look at their end-to-end engagement processes, identifying a number of areas for efficiencies and automation. With the knowledge of the old process combined with tech skills, Senior Manager Gulam Ansari was trained as a Digital Accelerator and helped the team develop automation solutions to remove bottlenecks in the process, reduce manual work on the federal side of the engagement and improve customizations related to a scope including income tax provision and income tax compliance work for approximately 250 entities. Additional capacity created by the new digital solutions has been redirected for team members to deepen their knowledge of the more technical tax areas of the return, including areas impacted by tax reform. “Having two years of experience with the client was helpful,” said Gulam. “We brainstormed and took a hard look at all of our processes. We identified pain points where we could make our work more efficient and created digital solutions that helped us work smarter. We also looked at how we could deliver for the client on a quarterly basis.” The digital solutions were selected based on priority areas determined by feedback from the client and team goals for reducing hours and was implemented in phases. They kept the client in the loop and showed them customized outputs based on their preferences. Simplifying the complex The team focused on reimagining the possible for their income tax provision and compliance work. The first phase was implementation of quarterly tax provision solutions in November 2018. The impact was significant and immediately felt by the team. This year, working remotely three team members were able to complete the provision calculation in a matter of hours, in contrast to 10-15 staff last year. The second phase focused on the tax compliance process. By working closely with our Acceleration Centers, the team was able to achieve high quality work product with faster turnaround times. With automated solutions the team was able to: Create an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool to automate the input of data, workpaper processing, as well as analytics to support the tax return deliverable, with an annual savings of 4,000 hours Reduce time spent providing tax provision support each quarter from 300-400 hours to under 100 hours, with an annual time saving of 1,500 hours Developed a Depreciation ETL model to substantiate tax basis in fixed assets saving an estimated 500 hours Provided customizations and analytics to provide more useful information for the client “It’s been great to see everyone get onboard and dig in,” said Abe. “The team now is able to work differently as a result of increasing digital capabilities to create more capacity that in turn is being used to add more value to the client.” Visit Digital Lab to learn more The solutions that the team created for their engagement are now available here on Digital Lab: Form 1120 Automation with Client Ready Workpapers and OIT Import File Tax Provision Automation General Ledger Manager (GLM) Trial Balance Import Depreciation Gross Timing Difference Calculation with Form 4562 Import for OIT Want to change your processes and enhance work within your team?

This team consists of industry certified professionals who know how to frame responses that demonstrate PwC's strong security stance. Please note, due to the volume of requests they process, the standard turnaround time for a questionnaire is five working days. A Client's data security inquiry could include an inquiry about our general security controls, sometimes extensive written assessments/questionnaires, and even intensive security audits. The staff members of the Client Interactions &amp; Contracts team are experienced in addressing data security matters and can assist an engagement team in the following ways: participate in conference calls with client IT security, identify appropriate documentation or evidence of our security policies and practices, and communicate security standards that address existing concerns in ways that avoid raising new concerns. There are two Business Services questionnaire forms for an engagement team to select from, and complete, to initiate an assistance request from this group: The Client has sent us their security evaluation questionnaire to be filled out - email your completed Business Services – Client Security Questionnaires and the Client's questionnaire document to GBL_Client-Security-Interactions@pwc.com. The Client is requiring specific contract provisions, and help is needed in negotiating the contract security terms - email your completed Business Services – Client Contracts and the Master Services Agreement (MSA), Engagement Letter (EL), Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), Request For Proposal (RFP), Business Associate Agreements (BAA) or other document received from the client to GBL_NIS-Client-Contracts@pwc.com. Note: If the client's data security inquiry is expected to lead to modifications to the engagement contract, involving your local tax risk management partner in initial correspondence will expedite the contracting process.

Ready, set, go: Here’s the PCS Tax Busy Season Toolkit! Tax July 31, 2019 Tax practitioners, As we begin another tax busy season, the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO, formerly Q&amp;RM) and Tax Knowledge Management (TKM) teams want to provide you with relevant resources to help you understand recent legislative changes, IRS issues, and risk management initiatives impacting your compliance efforts. Accordingly, the PCS Tax Busy Season Toolkit highlights resources found in Tax Source that will help you serve your clients during the remainder of 2019. Consider bookmarking this page so that the toolkit is easily accessible. Please pay special attention to IRS due dates, as well as the penalty waiver for certain individuals whose tax withholding and estimated tax payments fell short in 2018. In addition, refer to the Tax Reform home page for various materials that may be helpful in connection with 2019 tax provision reviews and estimated tax payment calculations. Because tax reform guidance continues to be somewhat of a moving target, make sure to consult this toolkit for updates that will help you in managing all of the complexities associated with your client work. Familiarize yourself with the compliance and technology resources within the PCS Tax Transformation site and Digital Lab (including the 'Tax Delivery Maps' found under 'Collections') to help streamline your engagements. Use the P5M Hours Saved tracker to log the hours you save by leveraging technology. When engagements are complete, ensure documentation of our work is properly included in DMS (not in emails, My Drive, etc.). Finally, regularly visit the OFRO home page for other valuable information and tools. Special thanks to Reed Sands and Denise Dockrey for providing TKM support associated with this toolkit. As always, we welcome your suggestions. If you have any ideas about how to make this toolkit more relevant to the practice, please contact Reed Sands at (503) 267-4739, or me.

Phoenix for Tax - Do you have questions? Tax Aug. 14, 2019 FAQ’s: Why can’t I find my service? Practice Area should be selected based on the work being sent. In addition, the associated services chosen when forecasting should match that of the Engagement. You should not mix and match services from different Practice Areas. How do I correct the error I get when I try to submit a service request? Populate your desired Service and #of Items in your Engagement forecast prior to requesting the service to avoid delays when work is ready to be submitted. Why do I have to submit service requests anyway? Not only do your requests provide the necessary information for the AC staff to complete the work, but also helps the AC management team manage their staff. Request details are automatically fed to a resource management tool used by the AC to assist in scheduling and capacity management. This ensures that staff are fully utilized at all times to provide you with the most effective and efficient turnaround times. Will I get notified when my work is completed? Keep an eye out for Phoenix emails entitled “Delivery Sprints have been delivered”. Failure to take action on this Task will result in cluttered widgets for both you and our Acceleration Center (AC) staff. This Tasks also provides the opportunity for you to utilize the “Rework” and/or “Review Complete” functionality to keep your AC teams organized. Is there a way to give my AC Team Feedback? Feedback can be provided upon completion of each sprint within Phoenix when clicking the Review Complete button. Help us improve! Where can I go for additional help? Visit the Phoenix Spark page and Phoenix Support for additional resources. Join our Phoenix Forum for urgent announcements and real time help from other users. Will I have to recreate my engagement next year? One of the key features coming in the September release for Phoenix is Roll Forward functionality. Your current year Engagement will be used as a template for next year’s Engagement. Key information, including your forecast, will be copied over and you will have the ability to edit for adjustments year to year. This will happen automatically on the end date of your current year engagements. For those utilizing Engagement Center (EC) this will happen upon manually rolling forward your EC Engagement. Stay tuned for more information as we get closer to our release date!

The timing of engagement teams obtaining an approved AFS as part of the engagement set-up process matters in terms of complying with our independence policy. As illustrated below, an AFS form must be approved by the Responsible Partner listed in CES prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. (Note, when providing certain services, you may need to obtain AFS approval from a Secondary Independence Reviewer by adding "US AFSReview" as an Approver on the AFS – see link.) When providing non-audit services to a restricted entity and/or their affiliates, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check CES and the GPA list; If restricted, initiate AFS &amp; engagement assessment process Receive AFS approval (or a notification AFS, if GPA only) from Responsible Partner in CES Complete engagement acceptance assessment Execute engagement contract Begin work The foregoing "sequence" is an essential part of maintaining our independence with respect to non-audit services (a professional responsibility for each of us to manage on our engagements). Best practices to keep in mind: An AFS is required for all non-audit services provided to restricted entities and/or their affiliates and global priority accounts listed in the Central Entity Service (CES) system and/or in the Global Priority Account (GPA) list included on the Global Client Portal (most easily accessed from the Engagement Acceptance Assessment). Note, a restriction designation is more than an entity being an audit client of the firm. An AFS is required for all restricted entities and/or their affiliates as designated in CES. An approved AFS must be obtained prior to executing an engagement contract with a restricted client and/or their affiliates. An approved AFS must be obtained prior to starting work on the engagement – Tax Time Charging Policy. If the nature of the services changes from what was included in the original and approved AFS, a new AFS and updated contract may be required. Engagement teams should consult with the Responsible Partner in CES to determine if a new AFS is required. If required, a new AFS must be submitted and approved prior to the execution of the amended/revised engagement contract and the commencement of work. If the Responsible Partner determines that a new AFS is not required, the engagement team should document the conclusion in the DMS Administrative folder. If the CES database indicates that an AFS is required, and you believe the CES database does not contain the correct information regarding the restriction status of a client, submit an AFS and consult with the Responsible Partner listed in CES. If an AFS is not required according to the Responsible Partner, the engagement team should document the conclusion and file it in the DMS Administrative folder. Engagement teams should prepare an AFS for each year/12 month period of a multi-year contract.(Note: a multi-year engagement does not require a new AFS if the scope of services does not change.) It is important that all engagement team members be aware of and comply with our non-audit service independence policies, by understanding the rules and the procedures to be followed to facilitate overall team compliance. For additional information regarding the AFS process -- including assessing permissibility of services, the AFS Process Sequence, protocols regarding Charging Time, and Scope Creep -- see the Tax Independence – AFS Quick Reference.

Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” What do seven days, 545 miles and cycling have in common? The annual AIDS/LifeCycle event...and our own Noah Figdor. From June 2-8, Noah joined over 100 other PwC xLoS team members in raising nearly $500,000 to fund HIV/AIDS services and increase HIV/AIDS awareness. This was PwC’s fourth year participating in AIDS/LifeCycle, where over 3,000 cyclists came together to join the fight in ending AIDS. “The most memorable aspect of the ride was the comradery I felt with my PwC team members and other riders who are also mission driven. I couldn’t have done it without my Tax team. I received an outpour of support from everyone in the San Jose office — so much so that I exceeded my fundraising goal and raised it twice,” said Noah. When asked what inspired him to participate, Noah shared his personal commitment to community involvement. Outside PwC, Noah is an avid participant in the non-profit space. He is a member of the Leadership Development Jewish Federation, on the board of a non-profit called Hebrew Free Loan, and is the development director of a non-profit he co-started called NJB-SF. Noah has been with the firm for four years in the Core Tax team, and he is currently on tour as a Digital Accelerator. He is part of the San Jose Tax Advisory Group and is a co-lead of Shine, PwC’s LGBT+ network, within his local office. “Noah embodies what our ‘Work Together’ value means to me. Whether it's Noah being one of the sole tax representatives participating in the AIDS/LifeCycle team or his teaming across tax BUs as a Digital Accelerator, his ultimate passion in life is to ensure we're all learning from and with each other,” said Tax partner Michael Chin. Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

As we digitize work through Your Tomorrow and Project 5 Million, improving firm business processes will be critical to recognizing value from our investments in innovation and our people. These updated business processes will provide greater simplification for our engagement teams. Updated FlexForecast business rules Current Tax business rules require all engagements with more than 20 hours to use FlexForecast to budget and monitor engagements. However, input from our staff and partners indicates that FlexForecast’s budgeting and monitoring functionality may not be as useful when managing smaller engagements. Based on your feedback, we are updating the FlexForecast business rules for FY20. We heard you! Beginning July 1, 2019, engagements that are less than 200 hours will not require a detailed budget or deployment hours in FlexForecast. Individual WBS codes on large engagements do not qualify. This only applies when the total hours on the engagement are less than 200. Note that the term "engagement" refers to the total contract. For example, if a compliance engagement has Fed, State, and ITS, and the ITS piece is under 200 hours but the overall engagement is more than 200 hours, ITS still needs a budget tab as part of the overall engagement budget. As another example, the same would apply to a Global Structuring engagement with multiple small pieces - we still need to see all the pieces if the whole engagement is more than 200 hours. Teams will only be required to submit the following information in the aggregate in MyEngage when requesting a WBS code: Expected Revenue, IPR%, Expected EM% and Total Hours (&lt; 200 hours) The Deployment team will work with small engagements to account for expected time in TalentLink, using block bookings for groups of smaller engagements which may share staff. If you have questions, please reach out to your finance contact, Project Management Driver or Deployment team in your market.

Last Signed Off Amount - When using the sign-off feature, this column makes it easy to see what the balance of an adjustment was at the time of its most recent sign-off and if has changed since then.

Adjustment Change Diagnostic Report - Take your review of the “Last Signed Off Amount” one step further and use this report to see what the adjustment balances were at the time of each level’s sign off.

Heading into year two of this effort, I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished and am excited about the year ahead — and the roadmap we have to use along the way. As we start the new fiscal year, I’m pleased to share our One Firm and FY20 Tax Expectations, which support our focus on upskilling, use of the tools we have to help simplify our processes and Be well, work well. It also includes guidance for business development, financial discipline, quality and our People experience. This is a resource for you to use throughout the year with your teams, in discussions with your Relationship Leader and in coaching conversations, as it outlines what we expect from each staff level and how you’ll be assessed in the FY20 CRTs. Digitizing and removing hours means we’ve lowered our total hours, which means we’ve lowered utilization and lowered the overtime hours expectations across staff levels. This is all part of our Project 5 Million journey, and even though we’ve lowered utilization goals, not all staff are yet feeling those effects the same way — which is why we need to continue to digitize to help everyone experience the capacity we’re creating. Please review and start planning for your FY20 success and growth, using your Development Team to refine expectations specific to your career development and business unit goals. Thank you for your continued contributions to our practice.

A joint business relationship (JBR) between PwC and another entity or person may include activities ranging from joint marketing and proposals to joint service offerings and oversight. A JBR can even result just from being a presenter at a conference or other public venue. Alliances and other recurring joint business relationships can present significant market growth opportunities for PwC as they can generate lucrative professional services revenues and provide an effective way to broaden our ability to deliver a wide range of high quality services to our clients. However, alliances and other JBRs can also pose significant risks and potential issues when not engaged or managed appropriately. The Business Relationships: Independence guidance link provides a framework for identifying and evaluating situations that may create a JBR and: describes attributes and other factors that help us determine whether a JBR is direct or indirect, provides examples of direct and indirect JBRs, as well as situations which would not be considered JBRs by applying the framework to different scenarios, and summarizes the process for evaluating, approving and tracking JBRs. For any questions please contact Eileen Connolly or Connie Crosley, or a member of the OFRO Tax team, or read more here.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between April 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019, you should contact Nick Nebolsine (571-332-9690) or Karen Jones (703-622-8971) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez 703-963-5641 for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

This is true even if the professional is not an accountant. IESBA issued a pronouncement that defines what you must do if you become aware of illegal or potentially illegal activities of a client. This pronouncement, titled “Responding to Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations” is commonly called “NOCLAR” and was incorporated into our US Risk Management Policies for Consulting Services effective July 15, 2017. Understanding your professional obligations All PwC personnel, even if you are not an auditor or a public accountant, must follow our Five Step Approach to facilitate the evaluation and reporting of any potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that comes to their attention, regardless of whether the acts occurred before or after the pronouncement was issued. 1. Become aware - once becoming aware, timely action is required; 2. Seek to obtain an understanding of the matter - the nature of and circumstances surrounding the act; Then, in consultation with Risk Management or OGC: 3. Communicate with others - determine appropriate individuals for notification; 4. Determine further need for action - evaluate factors related to the potential non-compliance; 5. Document - the matter, actions taken, response by client, and that the professional obligation is met. What do you need to know? You are not expected to seek out NOCLAR unless that is the stated purpose of the engagement. Consult with your engagement leader as soon as practicable if you become aware of non-compliance or potential non-compliance. Engagement leaders should consult in a timely manner with Risk Management or OGC. If the non-compliance or potential non-compliance is related to PwC, you may also contact the Ethics and Compliance hotline to begin escalation procedures as necessary. To find out more about what NOCLAR covers and how IESBA defines NOCLAR please refer to US Tax Policy-Non-Compliance with Laws and Regulations. For more information, contact Corina Trainer (M: 240-938-0441) or Nayan Bhihka (M: 703-964-6275) or reach out to another member of the OFRO Tax team.

Document substantive verbal advi Have you spoken to your client today? Document substantive verbal advice and emails in DMS Tax July 18, 2019 It’s critical to keep in mind the importance of documenting our work, including significant discussions -- internally and with the client -- throughout the engagement. All substantive client discussions related to the engagement -- including phone calls -- should be documented and included in the engagement file in DMS. Engagement teams should use professional judgment in deciding which client discussions and/or phone calls are “of substance” to the engagement, as well as in the overall preparation of the documentation. It’s recommended that engagement teams review the Documentation Toolkit for guidance on appropriate documentation. Useful tools and templates are available in the Toolkit to assist with the documentation process, such as a template that can be used to document verbal advice provided during client discussions and phone calls. The “File to TaxDMS” button - a Chrome extension available for download from the PwC Chrome Store - makes it easier to file Google emails and email attachments to DMS with a few simple clicks. Access this File to DMS from Gmail - Quick Reference Guide for instructions on how to add and use the “File to TaxDMS” button. As a reminder, the quality and contemporaneous filing of appropriate documentation for engagements is formally being assessed as part of the Tax Office Review program, including the documentation of substantive client discussions related to the engagement. For additional information related to the Tax Office Review Documentation Evaluation, please access this link for a template of the assessment and relevant help guidance.

So, you created your Digital Insights plan and scheduled some time to discuss the impact with your team. Now -- you might be wondering how your colleagues are using Digital Insights to spark new ways of working. Many of our teams are finding that once they’ve made a plan for maximizing digital solutions on your project,we can rethink our team’s staffing mix and staffing levels, by asking some simple questions, such as: Can the Manager or Senior Manager on the project work directly with the Partner -- freeing up the director previously assigned to spend more time in the market with clients? Can we go with 4 people instead of 5 on the engagement, freeing up staff to focus on building relationships in the market? How can we leverage the Acceleration Centers (formerly GDM), other alternative staffing resources (e.g. Flexible Talent Network or Talent Exchange), and Digital Accelerators to help us deliver differently? As we digitize and monitor engagement economics, are we updating staffing hours and needs in FlexForecast/TalentLink to help us staff appropriately? Looking for more ideas, guidance or tech support?

It’s almost Apple picking season! PwC Technology Aug. 26, 2019 Apple traditionally releases the latest news about iPhones in September — maybe we’ll get a juicy new model this year, maybe we won’t. Either way, if you’re curious if you’re due for a smartphone upgrade, find out in two shakes of a lightning cable by following these steps: Access the eMobility Portal and locate the Assets box. In the Upgrade Eligible/Date column, you’ll either see “Upgrade now” or your future eligibility date. Only smartphones are eligible. When you’re ready to order a new device, select Upgrade Now — more details here. What does upgrade eligible date "N/A" mean? You’ll see N/A for a number that’s not associated with a smartphone (such as an iPad or MiFi) or for numbers recently transferred into eMobility. If you believe your smartphone is upgrade eligible but your upgrade date shows N/A, submit this short form. Have questions? We’ll be standing by with answers on Friday, Sept. 6 For now, we only have rumors about the newest iPhone — but we have hard facts about eMobility and upgrades. Post your questions on our live online Q&amp;A. We’ll answer questions about all devices, upgrades and apps. Android fans, you’re welcome too! We’ll answer questions in real time on Friday, Sept. 6 from 11 a.m. - 3 p.m. ET. If you post outside that period, you’ll still get an answer — it just won’t be immediate. Stay tuned for more! When will a (potentially) new iPhone be available for preorder? What will it cost? Well, no one knows yet. As soon as we have those answers, we’ll report back. Plus, exciting changes are coming for our mobile infrastructure. Watch HQ for all the latest news. Wait to update your iOS We anticipate Apple will also announce an iOS update. Just a reminder — PwC Technology recommends you wait two to three weeks to upgrade. This allows developers (including PwC) to make updates so their apps work well with the new version.

Tiny annoyances build up over time — like when every time you click an embedded email link, Lotus Notes launches. With the click of a button, the Google-matic default email &amp; browser changer bot digs into your PC’s settings to switch your default email to Google Mail and your default browser to Chrome. That way, when you click on an embedded email link on any website, Chrome will open a new Google Mail message. No more waiting for Notes to lumber to life. No more pasting email addresses between platforms. No more shaking your fist at your screen. Run the Google-matic bot to save time and frustration. How do you run that bot? Go to the Google-matic bot in Digital Lab Select “Download to run” to install the bot. Open UiPath from your system tray (located at the bottom-right side of your desktop). Next to the bot name, select download Select the “Run” button and the bot will run a one-time execution to update all related PC settings. (This will take just a moment — don’t use your PC while it’s running.) Similar to other bots, UiPath and UiPath Robot Runner must be installed on your PC (available from Software Center). In addition, you must download the UiPath Chrome extension, and it must be running. Chrome extension troubles? If you experience Chrome extension troubles (like an error message that says the bot cannot communicate with the browser), there’s a bot for that, too! #PwCTech Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/firmwide/pwc-technology/know_service_hub.html</url><pwc_title>Tech tip: Know how, know where, know Service Hub</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-25 23:16:58</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>newsType:Firmwide|source:PwC Technology</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>Got a glitch?

How to be heard on Meet Can you hear me now? How to be heard on Meet PwC Technology Aug. 5, 2019 Follow these audio tips to have a “sound” meeting on Google Meet. Plug it in, plug it in: When using Google Meet in a PwC conference room, everyone gets the best experience by using the built-in technology where available (speakers, screens, cameras, etc.). Be sure to connect your laptop to both the HDMI and USB cables, and do not use wireless presentation, as it can cause audio issues. Hot tip for HP: If you have an HP laptop, your mic may be configured to block background noise (i.e., everything but the person directly in front of the laptop). To configure it for use with a group, click the Bang &amp; Olufsen (B&amp;O) icon in the lower-right corner → Microphone Experience → Conference. Lucky caller #6: When there are more than five participants, Meet will auto-mute all new joiners. Just select the unmute button on your PC or app; if you joined the Meet by phone, hit *6. Beware the mute hat-trick: What’s on mute — your Meet, your laptop, your headset? If others can’t hear you, check all your mute options: To see if you’re muted in Meet, look for the red mute icon. To see if you’re muted through your laptop, look for a button with a microphone icon (often with a slash or x through or next to it). If you’re using a headset, that device might also have a mute button. Check (all) your settings: To view the sound settings in Meet, select the three vertical dots and click “Settings.” Prior to plugging in the HDMI cable in the conference room, the instructions/settings for Meet are listed on the TV screen.

Enhancements to CES and AFS coming soon Who doesn’t love an upgrade? Enhancements to CES and AFS coming soon One Firm Risk Organization July 22, 2019 Later this summer, we’re launching enhancements to the Central Entity Service (CES) and Authorisation for Services (AFS) — our tools to manage restricted clients and authorize services we provide them. Core to our Continuous Improvement efforts, we’re making these tools simpler and more intuitive. Plus, they’ll be mobile-enabled, so you can access them on the go. Before these tools go live, how can you prepare? From August 9 to August 18, there will be intermittent, short-term disruptions to the availability and functionality of AFS, CES, Rapid Engage, Astro and Independence Checkpoint. Explore our AFS/CES guidance for more information on what to do during this period, along with the resources available to you. We’re transitioning to the new systems now to minimize disruptions to you and your team, as August is the slowest time of year for these tools. We’ll share more in the coming weeks in PwC Inside and on HQ. Take the following actions by August 8: Initiate, submit and/or approve AFSs to avoid delays due to system disruptions. This will ensure your ability to serve clients is not impacted while the legacy systems are down to prepare for go-live of the new tools. Please note: If you have an urgent need during the shutdown of AFS, a workaround process will be available here. This process is intended to be accessed for exceptional cases only. Ensure your client hierarchies are up to date. CES will be read-only beginning August 9 through August 18. Pre-clear your personal investments in Independence Checkpoint if you’re planning to make changes to your or your immediate family members’ personal investments. Still have questions? You can refer to our AFS/CES guidance and find more information on the global Spark project page.

To make sure we put our best foot forward in publications, as speakers at events and through other channels, as well as help minimize risks, follow these steps before you communicate publicly on behalf of PwC: 1. Consult with the firm’s marketing and external communications teams. They will help you through the public communications review process -- everything from guiding you through the Self-Review checklist to assessing whether your public communications require review by the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO). Consult with your marketer and external communications contact as early as possible to avoid a delay in approvals. 2. Make sure your communication is reviewed by OFRO, if needed. All US and Mexico LoS and IFS public communications should be submitted into the newly replatformed OFRO Public Communications Review system, which will help determine whether your materials need further OFRO review. Please note: You may not have access to the OFRO Public Communication Review system initially. Reach out to the OFRO Public Comms CoE team to request access. 3. Reach out with questions. Visit our new Public Communications CoE page on the OFRO portal or connect with your Marketing or External Communications contact. You can also review the US Public Communications and Social Media Policy.

Core to our ongoing efforts to run our business well and efficiently, we’ve simplified these tools to make them more intuitive and mobile-enabled. They’re also connected to other important firm systems like Salesforce — reducing the need to enter data multiple times in multiple places. Here are more benefits and features for each tool: CES AFS One place for all the information you need on restricted entities — reducing the need to look in multiple places. Integration of CES allows for timely business decisions, displaying relevant entity-specific independence rules and approval requirements. Simplified and improved user experience — no more information overload. Better visibility throughout the process by using a workflow that enables enhanced connectivity between audit and non-audit teams. Improved search means you can find the right entity quickly. Creating an AFS just got easier — including the ability to clone for repeatable services and amend for service changes. Important AFS-related changes to keep in mind: A draft AFS will be automatically generated when your opportunity moves from the “Target” stage to the “Interact” or “Propose” stage in Salesforce. An AFS will not be automatically generated if you move your opportunity from ‘Target’ straight to “Close” or “Closed-Won.” You can always generate an AFS directly in the new tool. If you currently add “US AFS Review” as a secondary approver in AFS, this process has been simplified in the new tool. You’ll no longer have to add “US AFS Review” (previously known as “AFS SoSR team” or “TS Independence”) to your AFS. “Independence Specialist” will be added for you as the secondary approver on your AFS. If you’ve already initiated an AFS in the legacy system, you’ll still be able to access and progress your existing AFSs as usual in the legacy AFS system, but for new AFSs, you should use the new AFS tool. What support and resources are available? Explore our CES/AFS launch page on the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) portal to learn more, access training materials and read through FAQs you might have as you use these new tools. Questions?

This means it’s critical — for both you and the firm — to protect and properly use client information we’re entrusted with. Can you buy or sell securities based on inside information you come across at work? Can you share this information with family members or friends? The answer to both of these questions is “no.” Inside information is non-public information about a company (e.g., financial forecasts, merger and acquisition plans and key personnel changes) and includes all confidential client information. PwC and applicable laws prohibit: Buying or selling a company’s securities when you have inside information about that company, whether or not the company is a client. Sharing any inside information with anyone. It’s considered tipping and is also prohibited. Remember, even if you don’t have inside information, if you’re working with a client, you can’t trade — buy or sell — any of your client’s securities while working with that client and for a period of six months after you stop. Watch this short video on what not to do with inside information and review our Insider Trading Policy.

Using the program’s flexible and motivational framework, we engaged in behaviors that support Be well, work well and the dimensions of energy — physical, spiritual, emotional and mental, as well as financial. Together, we’ve surpassed our expectations for the program and accomplished a lot (to say the least): - We took an average of 130 million steps each day. - Almost 25% of participants averaged 7,000+ steps a day. - We created more than 40,000 healthy habit challenges. - Fifty percent of members achieved reward level 3 or 4 each quarter. - There were almost 41 million interactions with the Virgin Pulse platform. New year, new start — annual points will reset Each quarter, your total points reset, and the same will happen on July 1 — the start of the new fiscal year. You have until June 30 to sync your steps, and accumulate points and rewards for this quarter.* After June 30, your points reset to zero, but you’ll keep any PulseCash rewards you’ve banked. Many activities you may have completed this year will also reset on July 1, which means you’ll have more opportunities to earn rewards in the new fiscal year, including: - Preventive health exam ($50 PulseCash) - Dental screening (twice per year) - Vision exam - Nutritional counseling, weight management or stress management program (twice per year) - Well-being goals - MyPulse survey (your results from the previous year will clear out and refresh starting July 1) Don't forget to reset your interests for the new year! With more than 15 topics to choose from, you'll get to view new and exciting content in the upcoming year. You'll also get 100 points each quarter for selecting different interests. Reset your interests by clicking on your photo icon at the top right of your Virgin Pulse account and selecting "My Interests." You can also go to Rewards&gt; How to Earn&gt; Set your interests. (From the app, go to the hamburger menu in the top left corner and click “My Interests.”) Starting July 1, you’ll also automatically earn 50 points a day per Gympass check in if you’ve purchased a membership plan.

Were your tax forms “rejected”? Network Information Security July 12, 2019 Were you one of the 10,000 partners and staff who caught the phish in our latest simulation? Or did you fall for the hoax that your tax forms were rejected? Thankfully, it was just a drill to keep you on your toes for common tax scams that ensnare people every year. To steal valuable personal data, cyber criminals often focus on tax and other professionals. And their methods are not limited to email — be wary of phone calls (vishing) and text messages (SMiShing). As our tax pros will tell you, the Internal Revenue Service doesn’t initiate contact this way. Tips to easily identify email threats: Verify the sender: Cyber criminals use names of colleagues to appear trustworthy. If it’s suspicious, check with colleagues directly to confirm if they were the sender. Verify the sender’s email address: Hover your cursor over the sender’s name to see their email address, and check the domain to see if it’s legitimate (e.g., @pwc.com). Be cautious of unsolicited email: If you didn’t expect to be contacted by an organization (like your bank), exercise extra scrutiny. Verify the email is legitimate and compare it to the address of the sender. If you doubt the origin of the email, text, or phone call … report it! Don’t click hyperlinks in suspicious emails: You can preview a hyperlink’s web address by hovering your cursor over it (without clicking). Don’t open attachments you weren’t expecting or from someone you don’t know. Report suspicious emails in just a click! It’s up to you to help protect client, firm and personal data by reporting suspicious emails. Simply click the phish button on the Google sidebar or forward the message to GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com. We each have a professional responsibility to stay alert and protect sensitive information. To learn more, visit the IRS list of prevalent tax scams or the Information Security Awareness page.

It’s true. What’s more, app stores aren’t required to describe what data is collected or to whom it’s disclosed. But what if you use your phone settings to limit contact or location sharing? Even so, the app can collect and share information not explicitly included in those settings. And even when app developers say they depersonalize data, it’s often assigned a unique identifier that can point to you. Sneaky. Follow these pointers to help protect yourself: Be cautious of any information you provide online. Assume that all data you enter into websites and apps can be shared, purchased or used for targeted marketing — even if you elected not to share location or contact info. Review the fine print. Read the terms of agreement and/or privacy notice to understand what information is collected and how it’s used.

Enhancements coming on Monday, Aug. 5 make Salesforce easier to use — and easier to capture the data that helps identify meaningful trends about our pursuits and client relationships. While these upgrades are being made, Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, Aug. 2 at 8 p.m. ET to Sunday, Aug. 4 at noon ET. Partners using our new Astro cognitive agent may also experience intermittent impact to your experience during the outage. Enriching data related to our pursuits 1. Contacts are now required on Opportunities in the ‘Propose’ stage. In line with our focus areas for FY20, understanding who the key contacts are on each of our pursuits will lead to an improved client experience and more targeted marketing efforts. Client contacts serve as buyers, coaches, influencers and stakeholders. Enter those contacts in the ‘Contact Role’ list on the opportunity page as soon as those interactions begin. 2. Multiple product codes can now be added during Detailed Opportunity creation. We know teaming across lines, verticals and groups can lead to multiple products being related to a single opportunity. This update allows you to add several product codes at once during Opportunity creation. Simplifying the Salesforce experience 1. Anyone on the Opportunity Team can unlock a Won opportunity. Opportunity Unlock is simpler than ever! Now anyone listed on the Opportunity team can unlock a win to make updates after closing. 2. Anyone on the Opportunity Team can unlock a Withdrawn opportunity. Feedback on unlocking wins has been positive, but we know opportunities could be withdrawn when they should still be open, or should have been correctly marked as a loss. The accuracy of our wins and losses will yield better insights. 3. Opportunity Leads can mark opportunities as Confidential. Opportunity Leads will join Opportunity Owners as users who have the ability to mark opportunities as confidential. As detailed in this July 22 PwC Inside article, we’ll be rolling out enhancements to the Central Entity Service and Authorisation for Services tools later this summer. Review the article and related OFRO site for considerations and next steps. Stay tuned to HQ for the latest in the coming weeks. Have feedback to share?

This deep dive into your feedback tells a great story about our strategy coming to life -- and your ideas on how we keep getting better. About 70% of us took part in the Global People Survey. Thanks to you, we have a very clear picture of what we do well and where we need to make more progress on our journey. You can take a closer look at our results below, but here are two points that got me really excited: the 19 point increase on developing digital skills and your feedback that you’re seeing more innovation in how we use technology to grow our business and use our talent to deliver for our clients. You also provided us with some excellent insights into where we should focus next. This includes helping our people make time for upskilling and continuing our efforts to make well-being central to our experience at PwC. What’s interesting to me is that these are areas we are already working on for FY20. These are also areas we can each influence through our personal choices and by working together in our teams to support each other -- whether that’s by protecting time to build our digital skills or making Be well, work well a priority. You’ll hear more about GPS in your lines and business units this summer as we take your feedback and turn it into action. And my one request for you is to talk with your relationship leader, coach and/or your teammates about where we’re headed and how we can help take our firm to the next step on our journey.

Hello FY20! Tim Ryan July 8, 2019 Team, Welcome back! I hope you had a great break -- it’s been fun to see the sharing on social media and I’m always amazed at the many different ways #PwCTakesABreak. Don’t forget to post your photo for a chance to win. I also want to say a huge thank you. Over 75% -- that's tens of thousands of you -- completed and earned your Digital Acumen knowledge badge. I could not be prouder! And what makes me even more excited is so many of you did this months ahead of the deadline so you could be a change agent at PwC. Team, thanks to all of you, we have the foundation to transform our business and our careers in even more exciting ways. Next up: we jump back in and use our new skills to digitize our business at scale -- team by team and engagement by engagement. Here’s what’s coming up for FY20: We’re going to make digitization our new business as usual. As we start each new project or engagement, we should make a plan for how we’ll execute Your Tomorrow to drive different outcomes. This includes leveraging upskilled people, the thousands of automations in Digital Lab, and tech-enabled approaches in each of our lines of service and coming from PwC Labs. Plus our upskilling journey will continue and we’ll soon be announcing our firmwide learning badge for FY20! We’ll continue to focus on making well-being central to Your Tomorrow. Taking a break after a busy year is one way we’re living our commitment. So is making Gympass available so we can work out near home or on the road. And so is having resources we can use when we need them -- like the Calm app or 24/7 emotional support through the Ginger app. One important way we can continue to raise our game is communicating and supporting each other. When we talk about well-being in our teams we can support each other in reaching our goals. We’ll keep a pulse on your experience at PwC through Feedback Fridays. This summer we’ll launch Feedback Fridays -- asking a question each week about different aspects of life at PwC. We hope you’ll be part of it because listening to your feedback is how we get new ideas and continue to make our firm better. And given how quickly we are moving, that’s more important than ever! We’ll put Astro to work to simplify and tech-enable our lives at PwC. As you might have heard from the partners you work with, Astro is our new cognitive agent. Astro will help us get things done by talking or texting from our phones. The partners are using it now and providing feedback to help us finetune Astro before we roll it out firmwide later this year. Team, everywhere I go I’m talking about the progress we’re making and the potential that lies ahead to do even more. Because of everything we’ve done in FY19, we’ve got the foundation we need to go even further and climb even higher. I hope you are rested up and ready to go -- I can’t wait to see what we accomplish this year!

That event opened up many conversations about what it means to be yourself -- and how to share that self with others around you. And what some of our colleagues have shared is how much words matter when we address each other. You might notice that some PwCers and other people in your network are including their pronouns in their email signature. By doing so, they're sharing something that's important to them by letting you know how you can refer to them. We often make automatic assumptions about what pronouns to use for someone based on their appearance. Gender is made up of three components. Sex, which refers to an individual's biology and anatomy. Gender identity, which is their internal sense of being male, female or something else. And gender expression, which is an individual's appearance, dress or mannerisms that may be perceived as masculine or feminine. But sometimes a person’s gender identity doesn’t align with their gender expression. If a person chooses to tell you their pronouns (in their signature or otherwise), they are letting you know how you can refer to them, without you having to make assumptions. It’s their way of saying “when you refer to me using pronouns, these are the pronouns I’d like for you to use. This is who I am. This is me.” I'm sharing this so we can all be better colleagues to each other as we go about our work each day. Words can make someone feel like they belong or like they don’t fit in -- and we are striving to be a firm where everyone feels they belong.

Shannon Schuyler, Farhad Zaman and Wes Bricker will be joining the USLT, bringing new perspectives and experiences to the team. For those who are new to the firm, the USLT has management responsibility for our business and for driving our strategy with speed and agility. We work on behalf of all of you to make choices for our firm and to keep our business strong for the long term. Shannon, Farhad and Wes will immediately begin working with the rest of the team to drive and execute our strategy. The USLT is representative of the tremendous diversity and talent within our firm and brings many different skill sets, experiences and ways of thinking to the table. Wes will step into the role of Assurance Leader, succeeding Maria Moats. Maria has led the Assurance practice through a very important period of change and innovation. Wes will help us keep our momentum and build on all that has been done to enhance audit quality, advance innovation and run our business well. Wes is a former PwC Assurance partner. He left the firm and joined the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2015 and was named SEC Chief Accountant in 2016. Wes has resigned from his role at the SEC and is returning as an Assurance partner, based in the Washington D.C. area. Shannon will serve as Chief Purpose and Inclusion Officer with responsibility for both the Office of Diversity &amp; Inclusion and Responsible Business Leadership. Shannon is a proven leader committed to meaningful change and action that drives connectivity, engagement and pride in the work we do together. Shannon will bring unique insights and perspectives from her existing roles as Chief Purpose Officer and Responsible Business Leader to the Chief Diversity Officer role. As she transitions into this role, Shannon will work closely with Mike Dillon, who has championed the importance of diversity and inclusion as a business imperative for the past three years. Farhad will serve as Chief Network Officer for the US, succeeding Suneet Dua. Farhad was born in Bangladesh and grew up in seven countries on five continents before joining the firm. He has 26 years of extensive international experience serving many of our global Fortune 100 clients as a Deals partner and through overseas secondments with PwC Australia, India and UK. In his 14 years as a partner, Farhad’s roles have included National Office partner, human capital leader for CMAAS and the US Capital Markets leader. As Farhad moves into this role, Suneet will be refocusing his time on Your Tomorrow as a service offering for clients. Team, we’re fortunate to be part of a firm that provides us with so many opportunities for growth and success. I know you will join me in congratulating and supporting all those taking on new responsibilities.

In my experience, our clients are hungry to hear our views on what’s happening in business. Of course, we don’t share confidential information. But as we do work for multiple clients, we have insights to share. What I do several times a year is reflect on the themes coming out of my conversations with CEOs and share these with my contact list of CEOs and others to give them insight into what other leaders are collectively focused on. I just sent my latest note to more than 1,000 business leaders. I also share this with our partners, and with all of you, to help you with your own client conversations. Please see my note below -- I hope you’ll find this helpful! And if you want to share with your clients, I’ve also posted my observations on LinkedIn. CEO Insights - July 2019 The best part of my job is getting to speak to CEOs and business leaders from a variety of sectors, industries and countries. Through our conversations, I’m able to get a good sense of CEO sentiment as well as identify the macro trends impacting all types of businesses and industries. Overall, I believe CEO sentiment is positive. But when you drill down, that positive outlook is pointed at the things that executives can control. On the things that can’t be controlled -- the economy, trade, regulation, etc. -- the outlook isn’t as optimistic. With that said, businesses aren’t standing still. If business executives have demonstrated anything over the last few years, it is that worrying about what you can’t control is not productive and energy is best focused on the things that can be controlled. As a result, most executives would classify the environment as “glass is half full.” Here are five key business trends that CEOs should keep in mind as they focus on what they can control: 1. Despite market uncertainty, organic growth goals remain high Even though CEOs can clearly see the economic headwinds that are on the horizon -- with growing trade tensions and market uncertainty -- most of the ones I’ve spoken with remain optimistic about their own companies’ growth potential. In fact, many have very aggressive organic growth targets despite knowing that supply in many cases is outstripping demand and that competition has become more cutthroat than ever. CEOs are realistic and know they’re going to have to fight for market share. And with 91% of US CEOs confident that their companies will grow organically in the next 12 months (according to the most recent PwC CEO Survey), we’ll likely see more battles for market share, where companies with the lowest cost and best value will win. As a result, CEOs and C-Suite leaders are laser-focused on improving the cost of their products and services, increasing their value proposition and improving their customer experience. This will be especially important if the economy turns and companies may no longer have the pricing power they once had. 2. Be nimble and move quickly: To win market share, CEOs must lead change efforts with intensity and urgency There is a wide range in intensity when it comes to how different companies and their respective leaders are responding to this more challenging business environment. Some companies are quickly adapting and changing, while others are moving much slower than expected. But the common trait among those companies moving quickly is the engagement and focus of the CEO. As one CEO said to me recently, “Let’s face it -- what people really want to do is get to their office and simply do their work the same way they did it yesterday.” This insight perfectly illustrates how behavior gets entrenched and how change often has to be driven from the top down. Indeed, CEOs need to be a “force of nature” in shifting the organizational and cultural behaviors responsible for preventing change from taking hold. I personally believe that this is a big opportunity for CEOs. They can take charge and be even more forceful in driving change within and across their company. This is especially true in a tougher economic climate, where greater reward will go to the CEOs and companies that achieve better execution versus the ones that just design the perfect strategy. Speed is the name of the game. As leaders, CEOs need to not only drive change with intensity, but also do it fast. The world is only going to continue to throw us curveballs, whether they be tariffs and trade conflicts, regulatory uncertainty, or market volatility. The key to overcoming these challenges is to build your organization’s ability to be nimble and to adapt quickly. 3. Are you getting the right return for your IT and technology spend? We are seeing a continued high level of spending on IT and emerging technology at most companies. New CRM, human capital and finance systems along with AI and data analytic platforms provide great promise of efficiencies, quicker data for making better and faster business decisions, more collaboration to better serve customers, and increased employee productivity. But unfortunately in many cases these aspirations are not being fully realized. Why? Many companies are implementing large-scale technology solutions but underestimating the behavioral and cultural changes that need to be managed with new technology. What do I mean? One CEO said to me that they invested in a new CRM system but underestimated the desire of middle and line personnel to simply do work the way they always did (meaning they did not embrace the new technology, but rather simply continued to use their legacy practices, spreadsheets and communications). The CEO surmised “we bought and paid for world class technology, but didn’t show our people how to work and manage differently” and therefore, “we didn’t achieve the benefits and ROI that was expected.” Major IT projects need active involvement by the C-Suite as well as the right amount of time invested in the change management around the system or technology being implemented. 4. Invest in “citizen-led” innovation and change We are seeing some companies invest in digital upskilling and teaching their employees, by the thousands, new skills such as data wrangling, data visualization, bot building and data automation, to name a few. What companies are discovering is that by teaching their employees in sales, finance, accounting, human capital and the back office these new skills, the workforce can then apply those skills to automating and reimagining their day-to-day work tasks. This can help create capacity for growth without adding headcount. Based on what we have seen from our own experiences, we are of the view that there are billions of dollars of cost savings to be achieved in corporate America if employees are given new skills. Similarly, we have seen that teaching these skills to large percentages of the entire employee base builds loyalty and can serve both to help attract and retain talent in what is only going to be a continuing tight labor market. 5. Investors are closely watching management’s ability to execute Most importantly, the investor community sees all the challenges and opportunities that companies and CEOs are facing -- and they’re making their investment decisions accordingly. While some companies will survive and thrive, others companies that are not able to remain competitive will become targets of activist investors and M&amp;A. And, of course, a major root cause of not being able to stay competitive is the effectiveness and speed of change that CEOs are responsible for leading. Investors are looking to invest in companies where the CEOs have the skills to lead change and transformation. They are looking closely at the quality and speed with which company management is transforming the business. One major investor shared with me that he is not looking to invest in companies with management teams that have the highest external profiles. Instead, he is looking to invest in companies with CEOs who are focused on the guts of the business because that is what matters. Companies that are going to be rewarded by investors are the ones that have CEOs and management teams who roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty in the change and transformation agenda.

What does the Salesforce-Tableau transaction mean to me? HQ News June 17, 2019 Last week Salesforce announced plans to acquire Tableau. As you may know, Tableau is an SEC-restricted audit client of PwC. Many of us use the Tableau tool in our work and may also be hearing discussions and reactions in the marketplace. Here are a few questions and answers to keep in mind. Will we continue to use Tableau in our work? Yes. We don’t expect any changes and we should continue to use Tableau for firm and client projects. Does this mean Tableau is no longer an SEC-restricted client? No. Tableau continues to be subject to SEC independence restrictions; those restrictions will remain in place through at least the actual closing date of the transaction. What if I’m involved with strategy or implementation for Salesforce proposals or projects for our non-audit clients? Should I be doing anything differently? It’s premature to focus on this given the transaction has not closed. We should continue with business as usual, which includes avoiding the promotion or endorsement of restricted entities such as Tableau. In light of this transaction, should I change how I talk to my client about using Tableau tools? Tableau is still an audit client and subject to independence requirements. Under independence rules we must avoid promoting or endorsing restricted entities such as Tableau. What if I have a question? At PwC, you never have to go it alone. When in doubt, please consult with our colleagues in the One Firm Risk Organization - Independence Office. We also have guidance on permitted activities when interacting with SEC-restricted software providers.

With our combined strength and resources, we’re bringing greater value to our clients and creating opportunities for our people. Teaming to deliver value to our clients. One of these cross-border success stories comes from our International Tax Qualitative Solutions team. Tax partners Lissett Tautfest, in Mexico City, and Justin Denworth and Darryl Wodecki in the US worked together to develop staff in Mexico to perform quantitative modeling to support our clients. By expanding the ITS-QS team into Mexico City, we were able to improve margins on the work we deliver to our clients, as well as respond to the increased client demand for quantitative modeling as a result of US tax reform. Lissett says, “Our staff in Mexico has shown agility, drive and an ability to work remotely with teams across the US, while learning both new technology and US tax technical skills. It’s a testament to what our people can do when presented with innovative and unfamiliar challenges.” Delivering deep local knowledge. Our strong presence in both the US and Mexico has been a differentiator when proposing to clients who do business across borders. For example, our firm now serves as auditors of Kansas City Southern Railway -- a transportation company with railway routes across the US and Mexico. According to engagement partner Christopher Briggs, our presence in both countries was one of the key reasons that Kansas City Southern chose to work with PwC. And earlier this year, we were chosen as global mobility providers for CEMEX, one of the largest companies in Mexico. The decision makers at CEMEX cited our track record in the broader tax area -- and our ability to field strong local teams in Mexico, the US and more broadly. Led by Tom Richards, with support from Alice Espinoza, the team includes PwC professionals from PwC Mexico, US, UK and Colombia. Opportunities for our people. The sharing of talent flows both ways between the US and Mexico. In the past year, we have had 75 international assignments between Mexico and the US, as well as many teams working together as we serve clients. The US and Mexico are also on a shared upskilling journey, using workflow and data visualization tools, as well as both building and using tools from the Digital Lab. As a result of upskilling, our teams in both the US and Mexico are using digital tools to add value for our clients. For example, the Advisory Finance practice in Mexico has been using Robotic Processing Automations to drive digital transformation by finding innovative ways to reduce costs, enhance quality and improve processing times for our clients in retail, health, telecommunications, financial and shared services. The Mexico Advisory Finance Practice has also teamed with the US and Acceleration Centers on projects for non-audit clients Ingredion and Pepsi. As we mark the third anniversary, we celebrate these and many other successes that come with serving clients together, sharing talent and bringing clients the benefits of deep knowledge and professional relationships on both sides of the border.

With the help of a few CEOs, we founded a coalition called CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion™. As we mark the second anniversary of CEO Action next week, I want to thank you. One of the reasons the CEO Action coalition continues to grow is because we’re talking with our clients, sharing our experiences and and asking them to join us. As the coalition grows, so does our impact. By standing together and sharing what we’ve learned, we’re not only driving change within our individual organizations but across the business community. As we talk to our clients and others, we can be proud to share what CEO Action has accomplished: CEO Action has grown to nearly 700 CEOs representing more than 14 million employees. Last December, the coalition engaged more than 615,000 employees of CEO Action signatories from around the world in conversations about bias and understanding in the workplace. CEO Action is leading an immersive, tech-enabled nationwide unconscious bias awareness tour that has already reached tens of thousands. And we can share the next steps we’re taking: Inside PwC: To mark the second anniversary, all CEO Action signatories have been invited to take action together, by holding open and honest conversations. Here at PwC, we’ve been holding our inclusive leadership training for 20,000 seniors and associates, so they can lead on these issues from the start of their PwC careers. With our clients: We can talk with our clients about a new CEO Action pledge to create and share strategic inclusion and diversity plans with their board of directors (or equivalent governing body). Given their shared responsibility for driving strategies that help companies thrive, boards and CEOs together play a critical role in cultivating strong, inclusive cultures and talent. This new commitment will help leaders drive accountability around D&amp;I strategies -- and for CEO Action to drive change across the business community. To help you prepare to talk with your clients, here’s an overview of what we are communicating this week. We’re truly an organization that leads with its purpose and values. When people ask me what that means, I’m proud to tell them about our role in leading the business community to do better on one of the most important issues of our time.

Responsible Business Leadership Aug. 20, 2019 Why mentor? It is back-to-school time across the country, and you can help get students excited about learning and prepared to lead in the jobs of tomorrow. Children in high-poverty environments struggle not only with basic needs, but also with losing precious time to continue their learning. The cumulative effect is a crisis in the making: By the fifth grade, summer learning loss can leave low-income students almost three years behind their more affluent peers. Mentor students and earn dollars for your favorite charity -- Win, win! The good news: Guidance from a trusted ally who can provide insight on everything from education to career options can make all the difference for many young people. In fact, students with a mentor are 55% more likely to be enrolled in college than those who did not have a mentor, according to mentoring.org. Plus, for each 25 hours of time charged to our volunteer WBS codes, you’ll automatically receive a $375 Dollars for Doers credit in our giving site to use for the nonprofit of your choice (up to $1,500/year). Remember to charge ALL your mentoring time to 80071199001; whether through PwC or outside the firm, on weekdays or weekends! How can I get started mentoring? Get involved with Access Your Potential, our firm’s commitment to bring tech, financial and career skills to students and teachers to help address the opportunity gap.

These actions make an impact in our communities and deliver business value by creating a more equitable society. You can support the firm’s Responsible Business Leadership strategy in many ways — through volunteer opportunities, donations, Green Teams and more. Still not sure how you can make a difference when it comes to the environment? Here are a few tips to help get you started: Get active — This is the simplest thing that all of us can do. Walk that short distance or ride a bike. It will help cut down on the automobile emissions and improve your physical energy, which is part of our commitment to Be well, work well. Save water —Support water conservation by using low intensity showers and switching off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving -- these are easy things to incorporate into our daily lives that ultimately make a big difference. Reduce, reuse and recycle — Say no to plastic grocery bags and straws, use coffee mugs, reuse shopping bags and glass water bottles -- and consider where else you can make these small changes. Join a local PwC Green Team, which helps focus on waste reduction and improving recycling in our offices. Stay cool without AC — Keep cool by opening windows and use hot appliances sparingly at night or in the early morning so your air conditioner doesn’t have to fight as hard to produce energy. And as a bonus, save money on your electric bill! Ride Together — By taking public transportation or carpooling to your destination instead of hopping in the car alone, you reduce your carbon footprint and get a chance to strengthen personal and professional relationships with fellow travelers. Use 'Ride Together', the firm’s rideshare app, to help find a travel buddy to and from the office, a client site or wherever you need to be.

Fifteen teams of PwCers from around the world will represent their home countries, including the US, Germany, Italy, China, Croatia, Slovakia and Poland. Team USA is looking to win back the championship title after a third place finish last year with a narrow loss to Serbia in the semi-finals. Team USA is made up of 13 self-nominated men and women with basketball experience from across the firm. They’ll practice together for the first time in Ljubljana on July 2 — just two days before the tournament. For the past few months, the team has prepped virtually with conference calls to get to know each other, exchange training tips and share strategies. The tournament is much more than just an athletic event. It began in 2008 as a way for PwC member firms throughout the world to network and connect with each other. The tradition continues, providing the opportunity for colleagues to develop their global acumen and live our values — showing that they care about the sport, the firm and each other. Stay tuned for the tournament results later next month. We wish all participants the best of luck! Interested in playing in the 2020 tournament?

The event focused on issues that affect the LGBT+ community, including how all of us at PwC play a role in building a sense of belonging for our colleagues. Here’s Kendall Toarmina’s first-hand experience at the summit and how being a woman, being queer and being a dedicated PwCer all came together to shape her participation. Kendall is a senior associate in Advisory, People and Organization and is involved in Shine. Outside of work she leads Rice University’s LGBT+ alumni association. She lives in Houston with her wife and their dogs. For our family, June is the most fabulous time of the year: Pride Month. This year was extra special with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, representing the LGBT+ community’s resilience, persistence and joyful inclusion. I was honored to be selected to attend PwC’s Global LGBT+ Summit and participate in World Pride. More than 160 PwC Shine members from the US and around the globe descended on New York City and came together as a global network to discuss issues that affect LGBT+ people in workplaces around the world, culminating in marching in World Pride. Our discussions were far-ranging and impactful. We talked about intersectionality — and how the different aspects of who we are overlap and interconnect and how that impacts our experiences in the firm and in the world. For me, being a queer woman is a big part of who I am. I’m also a consultant, an MBA and an advocate for social justice. Learning more about the identities and intersectional dimensions of my colleagues from across the firm helped me better understand them and build connections. We also heard some amazing speakers: Todd Sears from Out Leadership; Anna Brown, CEO and chair of Equality Australia; Kate Wicketts, vice-chair of Sydney Mardi Gras; Ricardo Goncalves, journalist with SBS; Josh Howard, director of The Lavender Scare; and Joanne Rogers, PwC leadership and organizational development consultant in the UK. Joanne’s session, Genius. Power. Dreams, was inspiring and something I’m certain will stay with me for years to come. The Summit: Connecting across the globe As I prepared to participate with PwC in the World Pride March in New York City, I did the only thing a seasoned pride marcher would do: I ordered as much rainbow glitter as TSA would allow me to carry! I packed my bags and my #glitterlife, and brought my wife and my whole self to New York City. One of the biggest highlights of the Summit was talking with PwCers from all over — Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oregon, as well as Turkey, Poland, Japan, China, England, Spain, Switzerland and South Africa — as they shared their stories and experiences. In total, more than 25 countries were represented. To me, LGBT+ pride is about radically accepting oneself. It’s about taking this part of one’s identity — being LGBT+ — that has historically often been a source of shame, and turning that shame completely upside down. It’s about saying, “Not only am I not ashamed to be who I am, I have pride in who I am.” For all of us, LGBT+ pride is about creating a culture where each of us can feel proud of who we are at work. I heard that from Assurance Partner Mike Dillon, “Early on, someone told me, ‘Just be yourself every day here,’ and I vowed to pass that forward.” And I also heard it from Bob Moritz, global chairman and long-time LGBT+ ally, “You can never have your best day or your best impact if you can’t be yourself.” What more can we do? Despite all our progress, Bob Moritz’s words during the summit rang true, “What we have done so far is great, but we’re humble enough to know that it’s not enough.” I asked other participants how we can all be allies to the LGBT+ community. Here’s what I heard: Learn about Shine and attend LGBT+ events in your local office. It goes a long way to show you care. Educate yourself about gender identity and expression. If you have a chance to help someone during or after a gender transition, lean into that and be there for them. More resources here. Use gender neutral language. For example, if a colleague mentions being married, don’t assume their spouse is a different gender by saying something like “What does she do?” A man might have a husband, and a woman might have a wife. Know that everyone’s experience as an LGBT+ person is different. If you have any questions, just ask! We want to share and help you understand. Coming together for WorldPride On the last day of the summit, our group met up at PwC’s Manhattan office to get ready for the WorldPride march. My wife and I sat down at a table and touched up our glittered faces. I offered to do a glitter rainbow on a friend’s arm, and soon, a line for glitter rainbows had formed at my little table! I loved seeing the looks on their faces as we brought their inner shine to the surface. WorldPride was the glitter beacon for the rest of the world to have a reason to join one another in struggle and in celebration. Pride Month in June is great, but it doesn’t have to be the only month in which we embody inclusion, joy and love for those around us, whether they are similar to us or not. It’s been almost three weeks, and I’m still finding glitter in my house. Truth be told, I wouldn’t have it any other way.

For inspiration, here’s what a few of our winners have been up to: Max Ikrom: As my engagement team's resident Be well, work well champion, I’m always pushing the team to work out when we're onsite at the client. This summer, we incorporated kickboxing into our workouts. To hype up the team, we took a hike in Hollywood Lake Park, Calif. to take a picture by the Hollywood sign. I take pride in the role I play to promote well-being amongst my teammates and being part of a firm that cares about its peoples’ well-being! Zebrina Stofiel: My daughter, Bella, is interested in marine biology. During our trip to Orlando, Fla., I made time for us to spend the day as aquatic animal trainers at Discovery Cove. We worked with a lot of different animals, swam with dolphins and went behind the scenes to learn about meal prep, cleanup and scheduling. The facility was amazing and furthered my daughter's enthusiasm for this subject even more! Thank you PwC! I could not have introduced my daughter to this experience without the support of my team and the firm's encouragement of work/life balance. Jeff Dietrich: My wife is an elementary school nurse, so with classes starting back up this week, we decided to head down the Pacific coast for a quick, recharging getaway. The views up and down the coast were amazing. I thought it would be fun to commemorate this moment while we were at the Dana Point Headlands Conservation area near Laguna Beach, Calif. Francoise Mugano: While traveling through Europe, I could not pass up the chance to visit Dubrovnik, Croatia. The city served as the filming location for the fictional fortified port city of King’s Landing in Game of Thrones (GOT). Being a big fan of the show, a highlight of the trip was not only walking around King’s Landing and the city of Qarth, but also sitting on the iron throne. I felt like I was in the middle of a GOT amusement park. I’m so grateful to be able to take this time off to reconnect with loved ones and myself! Haley Hosea: My uncle and I share a love for travel. Since we live in different states, we plan trips together. Our recent adventure took us from Santiago, Chile to the Patagonia region where we hiked in Torres del Paine National Park. We ended our trip in Argentina by exploring the Perito Moreno Glacier. Glacier trekking was a unique experience — this was definitely an incredible trip! Shelly Switick: Recently, I traveled abroad for a much-needed #pwctakesabreak to Iceland, Scotland and England. While in England, my best friend and I traveled to Teesdale Alpacas Farm at Barnard Castle because we're huge llama and alpaca fans. There we met a handsome alpaca named Dougal — he graciously agreed to take a selfie with us! Nate Gaudinez: I capped off my two-week trip in Asia visiting family in the Philippines by spending three days in Tokyo, Japan. While only a short portion of my trip, it was an amazing experience touring the various districts of Tokyo and immersing myself in Japanese culture. Visiting Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea was the cherry on top of an overall great trip!

For habit refresher team KINDa_Contagious, it helped them earn one of four $10,000 grand prize spots and brought our purpose-led, values-driven culture to life. The 16-person Southeast Market team boosted their emotional well-being by spreading kindness in their local communities. “We were motivated to honor the memory of Bo Jean,” team lead Amy Valenti said. “Bo was actively involved in his community and gave back. That’s why we committed to daily intentional acts of kindness for the habit refresher.” The team logged numerous acts of kindness throughout the challenge, including making bags filled with food and toiletries for homeless people in Tampa. While the habit refresher may be over, Team KINDa_Contagious is still going strong. “We learned that kindness truly fuels emotional well-being, and witnessed firsthand a reduction in stress, anxiety and negative emotions,” said Amy. “That’s why we decided to keep the kindness going by using all of our prize money to supply hundreds of children with backpacks and supplies for the new school year.” Every backpack will include a note in memory of Bo and a reminder that kindness is contagious — encouraging parents and children to pay it forward by directing them to PwC’s share kindness site. Each team member is selecting an organization or school in their community through which to distribute the backpacks. The team also launched crowdfunding pages on Impact Space to increase support to select charities. To date, they’ve raised an additional $3,000. “Acts of kindness create a ripple effect of positivity,” team member Amber Papadopoulos said. “We want to turn that ripple into a tidal wave.” If you’d like to contribute to their cause, please click here.

Our #pwctakesabreak July 4 shutdown is almost here! People Team June 28, 2019 The July 4th firmwide shutdown is just one example of how we’re committed to creating a culture where we can take care of ourselves and manage our energy. Whether you’re taking an exotic trip, relaxing at home or giving back in your community, share how you’re spending your break. From now until September 6, share your photos on Twitter and Instagram using #pwctakesabreak for a chance to win $150. Please see the contest guidelines and our social media policy for more details. In order to be included in the three random drawings taking place this summer, you must include your first and last name on your profile. Drawing 1 — July 16, post by 11:59 PM EST on Friday, July 12 Drawing 2 — Aug 13, post by 11:59 PM EST on Friday, August 9 Drawing 3 — Sept 10, post by 11:59 PM EST on Friday, Sept. 6 For some inspiration, here are a few of your colleagues’ Be well, work well plans for the shutdown: Remember, success is a team sport at PwC — and that includes being successful at unplugging and getting away. To help you do this, we recommend setting your email “out of office” message so your time away is protected. If you need to send an email during the shutdown, consider scheduling your message so it’s delivered when is best for both your clients and colleagues. Tips to help you get the most from your break and come back totally refreshed: Unplug from the screen: Stop yourself from checking email, social media and voicemail. Get your zzz’s: Sleep is key for well-being, so make sure you get enough during the time off. Try something new: Whether it’s salsa dancing or paddle boarding, do something different. Enjoy yourself: Do something you know will make you happy. You’ll bring that happy feeling back with you. Have a safe and fun summer break! Note: There will be some cases where individuals will need to work over the shutdown to meet client demands. Team leaders or partners will work with these individuals to help them take time away prior to or immediately after the break.

Whether you’re taking an exotic trip, relaxing at home or giving back in your community, let us know how you’re managing energy this summer. Eileen O’Neil: With the firm’s generous week off, I chose to volunteer my time in Costa Rica to help conservation efforts on the Osa Peninsula. The project included surveying various species of birds, primates, reptiles and bats in the jungle as well as protecting and monitoring sea turtle nesting activity along the beach. I was grateful for the opportunity to be informed, challenged and inspired while experiencing a new culture. Colin Gerner and Justin Hopton: We travelled to Beijing and Shanghai for the #pwctakesabreak July 4th shutdown. It was great to take in the many sights and unique experiences of China. The highlight of our trip was a private tour of the Great Wall of China, which concluded with singing karaoke with the local residents. We made many new friends on the trip and can’t wait to go back! Sona Tawney: For the first time in over 10 years, we went on a family vacation. We had a lot to celebrate — my parents’ 60th birthdays and my first wedding anniversary. My parents had never visited Mexico or experienced an all-inclusive vacation, so we surprised them with one to Cancun. It was so wonderful to spend quality time with the entire family and make memories that will be cherished forever. Thank you, PwC! Devon Van Buren: As a military family (my husband is on active duty in the Army), we relocated from Florida to New York City. Following the move, our entire family needed some rest and relaxation. The break was a perfect opportunity for us to take a road trip to see a bucket list item, Niagara Falls, Ontario. It was great to share this invaluable experience with my family during this time of transition. Mohana Beeregowda: Trekking has always been my favorite outdoor activity. With the week off, I decided to venture on my biggest trek ever — Everest base camp. I trained for many years to prepare for this particular trek. Reaching Everest base camp is a dream come true. Thanks for the time, PwC! Veon Watson: Prince charming (my husband Sean) and I got married in a magical ceremony! We are both huge fans of Disney and often spend our PwC breaks there. The reception was held inside the Epcot theme park and in classic Disney style the elaborate wedding was planned in one day! Wedding planners and experts were brought in from all areas and the rest was history. We truly felt like guests at our own wedding. Dan Choi: Surfing has been a lifelong passion of mine. For #pwctakesabreak, I unplugged from work and re-energized by surfing in Fiji. Cloudbreak is one of the world’s best places to catch a wave. Bula! Derek Hertges: I spent the firm shutdown on an annual hiking trip in Colorado with two friends from college. We traveled the state, camping every night and hiking every day. This year we tackled Manitou Incline and two mountains over 14,000 feet tall (Mount Harvard and Quandary Peak)!

Every year, our Talent Acquisition team helps us bring nearly 10,000 new interns and entry-level PwCers into the firm. We’re getting ready to launch exciting enhancements to entry-level hiring — a great example of how PwC is leading the way through Your Tomorrow to simplify and improve processes. Starting this fall, we’ll streamline the application and interview process by: Implementing national application deadlines for all entry-level hires, rather than following the dates set by schools that span over eight weeks. Leveraging technology to provide greater flexibility for candidates and interviewers by conducting all interviews virtually. These changes will reduce offer times for most applicants and improve their overall experience. Our recruiters will have more time to spend with the candidates we want to hire and we’ll have greater visibility into the full talent pipeline. Watch this video to see how the new process works.

People magazine recognized PwC in its annual “50 Companies That Care” list, and we’re No. 6 , up from No. 42 last year! To identify Companies That Care, People partnered with Great Place to Work®. Rankings are based on surveys representing over 4.5 million employees’ experiences of how their workplaces have made a difference in their lives and in their communities. Rankings also reflect Great Place to Work's assessment of the generosity of each organization's benefits, philanthropic and community support, with particular focus on activities occurring in the last year. Our continued investment on diversity and inclusion, well-being and Responsible Business Leadership, and Digital Upskilling through Your Tomorrow — reinforced by our purpose and values — underscores our commitment to create a place where everyone is supported and encouraged to become the best version of themselves. Through the survey responses, here’s what was heard: We offer generous benefits and wellness perks. We provide generous leave policies and an innovative phased return-to-work program. We offer an unprescribed number of sick days for eligible staff, to take time off for their own illness or injury. We support our people in times of need. The PwC Charitable Foundation, Inc. makes contributions to our people and their immediate families in times of unexpected financial hardship. It also helps fund charitable organizations where our people volunteer. We listen and build trust. We’ve held hundreds of Inclusive Leadership and Belonging sessions. They are helping us learn what we can do to make the experience for every person at PwC even better. We continue to lead the way on this and are doing our part as individuals and a firm through the CEO Action “I Act On” pledge to personally commit to support inclusion and driving action at PwC and in our communities. We make flexibility and well-being work … every day. We know that flexibility is good for both our people and our business. Our people have the flexibility they need where, when and how they work. And we’re committed to a focus on well-being through Be well, work well, as part of our caring culture. Volunteerism is at the heart of our giving culture. As part of our Responsible Business Leadership strategy, we encourage our people to volunteer for activities that are important to them. We couldn’t have earned this recognition without building an exceptional culture together — one that inspires all of us to deliver our best. We’re excited to see our contributions have an impact, and that we’re making a difference for our clients, our communities and one another.

Desktop users can access it here. And remember, if you’re not on PwC office wifi, make sure to launch VPN when accessing internal links (and apps if you’re an Android user) from your phone. The sleek, modern design will immerse you in digital learning from the first click or tap. New features include a digital channels carousel and a list of recommended learning assets. Plus, you can access the Digital Lab on the dial pad in the top navigation bar and register for a Digital Academy session right from the Digital Academy page (several sessions have July openings!). Announcing our next class of Digital Accelerators Congrats to our second class of DAs who are ready to “rock it” in orbit! We had thousands of self nominees and we’re excited to announce the next crew. Check out the Digital Accelerator crew roster Class 2 will begin their Digital Accelerator missions at one of two Liftoff onboarding sessions in August 2019 or January 2020, after which they’ll continue their learning while applying their new digital knowledge and skills to their assignments on the ground. We notified those who self nominated in Advisory, Assurance and IFS of their selection outcomes last week. (Tax applicants will be notified in September in line with the timing of other Tax staff redeployments.) Stay tuned for more details about where we’re headed in FY20. And congratulations to our second class of Digital Accelerators — good luck to all of you on your digital missions!

It’s very similar to the current US version, with a few minor differences that will bring us in alignment with the rest of the network. One benefit: Cross-border teams will be able to more easily request and provide Snapshots. What’s different: Consistent vocabulary in every territory (for example, you’ll see minor changes like "partially at grade" instead of "partially at level"). Language translation functionality -- especially beneficial as we work closely with our Spanish speaking colleagues in Mexico. The global version does not include the Future Focus Area textbox. In addition to Real-Time Development conversations, we have the ability to capture Future Focus Areas using the Workday Feedback feature. Click here for more info. Snapshot tips: Initiate and complete Snapshots throughout the year as project milestones are met and/or work is completed. Add these reminders to your calendar as appropriate for your role or practice: July 26, Sept. 30, Oct. 31, Dec. 20, Feb. 28, March 31, April 16. Discuss Snapshots with your reviewers. You’ll gain insight on your progression against the PwC Professional and have a better understanding of your impact and development. Aim to receive approximately 6-12 Snapshots during the performance year covering 80% of your total hours worked. For more information on Snapshots, visit the PwC Professional Snapshot page. Contact: People Communications &amp; Change Quick read A new cloud-based global Snapshot tool will be available on July 1. Use the new tool to initiate Snapshots for the current performance year (May 1, 2019 - April 30, 2020).

Here’s Kristina’s story, in her own words: I really enjoyed reading the story about Amit Acharjya in PwC Inside. It made me think of the small, yet large, changes that PwC has made for me as well. Ever since the firm started offering Well-Being Rewards on Virgin Pulse, I have been addicted to reaching each level in time. I track my sleep to get at least eight hours every night, take as many steps as I can every day (I take the stairs when I used to take the elevator for only one floor), I started eating yogurt or fruit for breakfast instead of nothing, and I take three deep breaths to calm my mind at least once a day using the Whil app to guide me. Thanks to all this effort, I earned enough money from Well-Being Rewards and Real-time recognition to pay for our family vacation two years in a row. We didn't used to go on vacations because we’re so dedicated to working our way out of debt that we put every extra penny toward that. However, when I saw the money I earned through these programs adding up, I told my husband that we should save it for us and see where we ended up by summer time. Last summer, we saved $600 and did a variety of activities in the Tampa/Orlando area, including a day at Legoland that my kids will never forget. This year I got serious about it, and between all the rewards I earned plus the $200 I won in the Digital Lab communities contest, I was able to save $1,000 for our vacation! We got annual passes for Legoland and even got to spend a few days there in an Airbnb. My kids have never taken a vacation where we stayed multiple days overnight before and it was so much fun for us all. So I guess I just want to say thank you, PwC! We now have two years of amazing family vacation memories that we wouldn’t have had without Well-Being Rewards and Be well, work well, not to mention the effect all these new healthy habits are having on my life personally. I didn't spend a single penny of my paycheck on either vacation — that's certainly not normal for the average American who often ends up paying for their vacation months after they take it. So again, thank you! Thank you for being a firm that cares for the well-being of your people. It certainly has made a difference in my life. Download Virgin Pulse for Well-Being Rewards from PwC’s App Store. It keeps you motivated with challenges, healthy habit tracking and tips to Be well, work well — and you earn rewards along the way.

In fact, we’ve found that referrals onboard quickly and tend to stay with the firm longer. Referring experienced candidates can be done easily and quickly in Workday. Type “Find Jobs” in the Workday search bar to get started and find a job that suits someone you know. If a position is available for a referral, a “Refer” button will appear next to the “Apply” button. Click “Refer,” complete the required information and click “Submit.” The candidate will receive an email confirmation with a link to apply for the role. After applying through the link, your referral will be tagged as a referral. To see their status throughout the process, simply type ”My Referrals” in the Workday search bar. As a reminder, you are only eligible for a potential referral reward for hired referrals submitted through Workday (refer to the QRC and policy links below for additional details). Referral payout policy update Referral rewards are eligible for payout 15 days after a referral starts employment at PwC. The referral reward will typically be paid out within two pay periods after the eligibility period. Beginning Sept. 1, payout eligibility will expire 180 days after the eligibility date (15 days after the referral starts). It is your responsibility to follow up with the recruiter if you’re not paid out within the 180-day window. For more information, visit the Employee Referral Program site and review the Refer a Candidate quick reference card (QRC) and policy.

If the email isn’t record data, but you have a business need to keep it in your inbox: Open the email and select Move to or Label As in the toolbar Select MySavedEmails(US) Your email is now tagged to be retained outside of the 18-month retention period. An email can be tagged to multiple labels and sub-labels, but you must also tag it with the MySavedEmails(US) label in order to retain it outside of the 18-month retention period. PwC will be monitoring use of the MySavedEmails label to ensure we, as a firm, maintain realistic targets for how much we keep outside of the retention period. A good baseline is to aim to save less than 5% of your emails. Again, record data must be stored in the appropriate system of record. Excessive saving of non-record emails outside of the retention period is out of compliance with firm policies. What about My Drive files? The retention period for My Drive files is longer than it is for emails. My Drive files will be deleted 36 months after the “last modified” date. As long as you and your teams are actively working with a file (not just viewing it), you’ll keep resetting the clock on when the information is scheduled to be deleted. If you have a true business need to keep My Drive files for longer than three years, consider whether they would be more appropriately stored in a system of record. Get help! Join a Connect &amp; Learn session Aug. 9 or 16 where we’ll show you how to use the new MySavedEmails label and answer your questions. Schedule a team consultation with the Chief Data Office for help thinking through data management processes that support your team’s specific needs.

Since last year, we’ve been taking consistent steps forward in standardizing how we work with our Acceleration Centers and Centers of Excellence. Phoenix represents just one of the steps on this journey toward standardization, digitizing our business with Your Tomorrow and using technology to simplify your work life. The latest release In the latest version of Phoenix, users will see expanded functionality around things like service building and WBS code lookups; a streamlined version of Advisory’s solutioning service; and, for Assurance, Phoenix will simplify the engagement creation process by replacing the GEM system. Check out the release notes for more details on the new features and visit our Phoenix site for QRCs, videos, FAQs and support. What’s next Within the next few weeks everyone, with limited exceptions, will be using Phoenix to send work to the Acceleration Centers. By Sept. 30, the legacy Assurance and Tax workflow tool, Envoy, will cease to accept new requests (it will still be used by some IFS teams). Phoenix will continue on its agile development journey to add even more functionality — continue to read PwC Inside for updates on each release, and keep sharing your feedback on how we can make Phoenix work best for you! Phoenix in the lines Advisory Beginning July 29, we are eliminating the required download of an offline Acceleration Center SOW contract in Phoenix and streamlining the “SOW Approval” and “Service Intake” requests into one process. With the Advisory solutioning service, Phoenix serves as Advisory’s single source of truth for forecasting for our Acceleration Centers. Assurance This week, we retired GEM — and Phoenix launches Aug. 12 across Core Assurance and most of Risk Assurance. Engagement teams will use Phoenix to request, receive and manage resources and services from our Acceleration Centers — including creating profiles and completing the annual AC Checklist. PCS Assurance was fully onboarded to Phoenix in June and TEA COEs are also now using Phoenix to manage their workflows. Read more about the important actions Assurance teams must take to prepare for the transition and to link Aura databases to new Phoenix profiles. IFS Technical analysis is underway to determine the appropriate approach for onboarding IFS service teams to Phoenix in a timely manner. The focus early on in FY20 is still to transition IFS services off of Envoy and the legacy BPM platform to Phoenix. Collaboration also continues with IFS service teams and Acceleration Centers to define how to best request IFS service support in Phoenix. Tax All non-IAS Tax engagement teams should be using Phoenix for submitting both their engagement forecast and work requests to their Acceleration Center teams. For more information, view the Phoenix in Tax site or discuss with your Acceleration Center contacts. Beginning July 29, the Tax Phoenix workflow will include a two-way feedback option to give a star rating on each of your requests. The new functionality is a quick way to provide feedback on the deliverables you receive from the Acceleration Center.

One of the best features of the updated site is the Home page, which contains “My Feed” — the central location for everything about your day-to-day activities. Based on what we know about you and your role, you’ll receive notifications (known as “nudges”) in My Feed to help guide you to where your attention is needed most. In the feed, you can add nudges to Google Tasks, view more details about why we’re nudging you about a particular topic (like a past-due invoice with the invoice number), and archive a nudge to remove it. If you don’t have any nudges or have archived your entire feed, you’ll see a message saying you’re all caught up! “By the Numbers” is another widget you’ll see on the Home page. This customizable area keeps you up-to-date on the six metrics most important to you. Just click the cog icon or the plus sign, select which metrics you’d like to see, reorder them, and click out. The “Approvals” Home page widget pulls information from different systems across the firm, highlighting areas where you have responsibilities as an approver. This widget will tell you the number of approvals needing your attention, as well as highlight key pieces of information for each system like approval type and days outstanding.

As of July 1, the SDCs supporting the US firm are officially known as Acceleration Centers (ACs) — but there’s much more happening than just a name change. This transformation includes standardizing and automating the work done in our Acceleration Centers, expanding Your Tomorrow to include our AC teams and enhancing the ways we work together on engagements. Today, 13,000 AC staff in eight locations around the world work with individual lines of service in the US and other member firms. These teams are already critical to helping us deliver enhanced quality to our clients while we drive down time and cost of delivery. They provide a wide range of capabilities and services, including core compliance, transfer pricing and other specialized services for Tax; substantive testing, manual controls testing and other audit, attest, and non-audit related services for Assurance; technology, management, risk and strategy consulting services for Advisory; and various support services for IFS teams including Network Information Security, Marketing &amp; Sales and Ethics &amp; Compliance. Now, as we transform and digitize our business, we’ll implement the same strategy and approaches we are already familiar with and working on as a firm to transform our centers to support our new, digital way of working. What does this mean to you? One way this is already happening is through our use of Phoenix for requesting and managing work performed by our ACs. We've been moving toward using Phoenix on 100% of our engagements with ACs and this journey continues. As those of you who are familiar with Phoenix already know, this is a big step forward in terms of consistency and standardization -- and making it simpler to work with the ACs. Our lines of service are working with the PwC Labs teams and the Acceleration Center Strategy Team (formerly our Global Delivery Model Services team) to automate and scale LoS services in the ACs. Watch for more details from your line of service. We’ve been upskilling our AC teams to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation, and so our AC staff have the digital acumen they need to seamlessly work with our engagement teams as we increase the use of digital tools. Nearly 10,000 AC staff have completed Digital Academies and other advanced technology training, and a dedicated Digital Leader and team at each center drive automation and upskilling activities. You’ll be hearing more from your line of service in the coming weeks and months about other steps we’re taking to work more seamlessly with our ACs. Stay tuned!

In this case, teams from PwC’s San Diego and Tijuana offices came together in a One Firm fashion to help deliver a miracle to a struggling family in Mexico. For three days over the span of five months, volunteers from the US and Mexico offices rallied together to raise funds (over $17,000!) and build a three-bedroom home for a family of five. “We volunteered through Build A Miracle, a non-profit organization that provides safe, dignified homes to impoverished families in Tijuana,” said Assurance Senior Manager Scott Dudzik. Forty PwCers from the San Diego and Tijuana offices joined forces in a volunteer effort they hoped would make a significant impact for this border community. “We couldn’t have achieved it without a great deal of teamwork and collaboration,” said Rosalinda Magdaleno, a receptionist in the Tijuana office. “We learned that many of these families live in one-room shacks with dirt floors and no electricity or plumbing,” she explained. Building new homes is just one aspect of how Build a Miracle makes a difference. “They build 40 homes a year — but their impact extends beyond shelter,” said Scott. “We chose to work with Build A Miracle because of their commitment to create a sustainable community.” Build A Miracle families complete 500 hours of community service before being placed on a waiting list for a new home. Rosalinda added, “They also help families through educational programs and community outreach of all kinds, like tutoring, vocational training, scholarships and computer labs — even music and dance classes. It’s about growing a community — and providing the tools and groundwork to thrive.” Once their house is complete, each mission family is asked to stay involved with the community to enhance the area and the lives around them. “It’s a circle of love — a true team effort,” said Rosalinda. The San Diego and Tijuana teams were thrilled to meet their Build A Miracle family and work alongside them to mix and pour the cement foundation and to paint and install drywall and insulation. They were provided step-by-step instructions. “Thank goodness, because we were clueless!” said Rosalinda. “One day we even covered a window in installation materials! We seemed to always be covered in paint or mud, but we learned a lot and in the end, completed a solid home we’re proud of.” The volunteers even orchestrated a big reveal when the house was finished. What followed were happy tears and promises to stay in touch. “We got so close to the family — they kept that promise by sending each of us a heartfelt note of thanks,” said Rosalinda. Teaming with PwCers from across the border also brought its share of joy to our volunteers. “We traveled together by bus to the building site during each visit. That time together was precious,” said Rosalinda. “Getting to know each other during those trips enhanced the entire experience.” “We offered support to the Tijuana community, but they made an impact on us, too,” added Scott. “We got the chance to build relationships with a Build A Miracle family and got to know our colleagues from another office. What a gift!” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/firmwide/miscellaneous/mymetrics-applications.html</url><pwc_title>All-access analytics pass</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-07-23 00:23:06</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>newsType:Firmwide</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>myMetrics’ Applications page connects you to analytics sources across the firm.</pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2019-07-22 22:17:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>HQ News</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>All-access analytics pass All-access analytics pass HQ News July 22, 2019 Since launching the new myMetrics on June 10, we’ve heard great feedback about how easy it is to use and how robust the metrics are. By now, we hope you’ve explored the various myMetrics pages available to you and are gaining valuable insights about you and your team, as well your engagements. When you need to access the systems and dashboards from which myMetrics pulls data, e.g., GFS, Workday, Salesforce, check out the Applications page. It offers an alphabetical inventory of the analytics resources the firm offers, and also recommends specific analytics applications for you based on your role at the firm. Highlights of the Application page include application sharing and the “Explore” feature: The “Shared with me” ribbon on the Applications page displays the applications that other users share with you. You’ll receive an email notification when a user shares an application. The “Explore” button brings you to an overview of the selected application, which includes a brief description and security details. NOTE: Some applications contain a “Request Access” button. When available, this button allows users to submit a request for access to the application. The approver will review the request and notify the requester once there’s an approval decision.

Amit Acharjya’s Be well, work well story How sweet it is! Amit Acharjya’s Be well, work well story People Team Aug. 15, 2019 For Senior Associate Amit Acharjya, who works in PwC’s Acceleration Center in Bangalore, taking well-being to new heights began with a few small steps. Here’s his take on why following a simple exercise and nutrition regime was the start of something big — a new lifestyle and frame of mind. One day in October 2017, I was about to take a sip of tea with a couple of teaspoons of sugar, which was my usual habit. Suddenly I realized, I worked hard in the gym today — why sabotage a 90-minute workout? So, no sugar in my tea. The next day, I replaced my twice-a-day milk tea habit (more like, addiction!) with green tea. I was too tired to hit the gym, but then another mind-altering thought hit me — I had been mentally tired of being physically tired for a long time. I decided to go to the gym anyway. That night, I slept well, woke up refreshed and decided to read a book. At one time I was an avid reader, but now I couldn’t remember the last book I had read. Deciding to alter that pattern, too, one book swiftly led to another. With a little willpower, I managed to eradicate sugar from my diet. I sacrificed a few parties but it was worth it. The benefits just kept coming. With better sleep and good nutrition, I found my energy levels elevating, allowing me to lift heavier weights at the gym, resulting in transforming my body and fitness level. Three months after I put down the sugar, I visited my parents for two weeks. I couldn’t smoke my daily cigarettes there (yes, another habit), so this trip presented a good chance to quit smoking once and for all. I did some research and tried to implement deep breathing to calm my mind. While I haven’t quit completely, I’m proud that after five months, I no longer need my daily cigarettes. Soon after joining PwC in April 2019, I heard about the annual TCS World 10K Bangalore race. I had doubts, but registered anyway. The worst that could happen is that I wouldn’t finish. Running at 5 a.m. through the streets of Bangalore alongside thousands of people was a beautiful experience. I completed the run in less than 54 minutes; it was a giant step for me. Sometimes, I feel that all of these changes are too good to be true. I used to live in a vicious and endless loop of depression and anxiety, midnight smokes, sleeplessness and poor nutrition, which would lead to more stress, more sleeplessness, more smoking, and so on. It was a difficult cycle to exit. Reading “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg was another turning point for me; that’s how I learned how habits can change your life. Who knew that exercising daily would lead to a lifestyle full of better nutrition, reading, writing, meditation and a deeper sense of overall well-being? I’m forever grateful that small changes brought such big results. Have your own Be well, work well story to share? Post it on the Spark blog or let us know at us_hq_news@pwc.com.

When Digital Lab launched last November, we challenged you to dive in and explore the community. Now, in our second fiscal year with Digital Lab, we’re raising the bar. Beginning July 1, we’re making changes to how points are redeemed -- and will be paying out up to $1 million in rewards every quarter of FY20. What’s changing on July 1? Points redemption rate will vary by quarter, based on the total number of Digital Lab points earned that quarter across the firm. Maximum redemption rate for 1,000 points will be $150 (currently, points are converted at a rate of 1,000 points = $100). Points will be cashed out automatically at the end of each quarter. Eligible users who earned 500+ points in a quarter will receive an automatic payroll redemption shortly after the end of that quarter, based on the new rates described above. “Current Period” points will reset at the start of each quarter. Now that we’re all using Digital Lab more, you won’t earn points for basic tasks like reviewing and rating, but will continue to earn them a number of other ways. For more information on how to earn points, click here. What will happen to my current Digital Lab points? If you have 250+ points available to be redeemed within Digital Lab as of June 30, you will receive an automatic payroll redemption at a rate of 1,000 points = $100. Are you close to 250 ‘Available’ points but not quite there yet? Check out “Recommendations for You” on your Digital Lab homepage for some automations relevant to you -- and earn points for running/downloading them “Available” points will reset on July 1; any points earned from July 1 onwards will be earned and redeemable according to the FY20 process outlined above. Additional questions about this change? Check out our Rewards one-pager and additional FAQs. And don’t forget to keep visiting Digital Lab each week to check out the new enhancements that launched last month, and find new digital assets relevant to you and your engagement teams.

Washington Update: Oversight or overreach? Office of Government June 13, 2019 For internal use only. A message from Roslyn Brooks, Government, Regulatory Affairs &amp; Public Policy leader. Overview What is prudent, constitutionally mandated congressional oversight, and what is partisan, politically motivated overreach? It’s a question that has challenged lawmakers and voters alike throughout our country’s storied history. Recently, the Democratic-controlled House has issued multiple subpoenas related to the president’s tax returns and the Mueller report; voted to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress for his failure to comply with their subpoena; and wrestled with whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings against the president. Some argue these actions skew more toward overreach than oversight. However, the question of overreach extends beyond congressional investigations. President Trump’s use of emergency powers to access money to build a wall on the Mexican border had even some Republicans questioning the action as a potential overreach of executive power. What does this political landscape portend for our firm and our clients? The oversight/overreach dynamic has become a political tug of war, exacerbating an already hyper-partisan environment in which each party appears focused on appeasing its respective base. As outlined in previous communications, the potential for alignment of politics and policy continues to narrow between the parties. Political polls show there is low urgency for either party to work together toward significant legislation at this point in the election cycle. In 2019, Congress’ and the president’s approval ratings have been at their highest points since the Trump presidency began, despite having few significant legislative achievements to show this year. Both sides generally feel the current strategy of working together when politically feasible and pushing their own agenda at all other times is a winning blueprint for success in 2020. Against this backdrop, expect the Trump administration to continue pushing its “America First” agenda, particularly focused on issues like immigration and trade. The Republican-controlled Senate can be expected to continue its focus on confirming executive and judicial branch nominees, made easier by a Senate rule change that reduces debate time for certain nominees from 30 hours to two hours. And in the Democratic-controlled House, the majority likely will continue oversight of the Trump administration, including investigating the findings raised in the Mueller report, as well as putting forward their own legislative proposals around healthcare, immigration, and pay equity, among others. Importantly, businesses must remain nimble and engaged on their policy priorities despite this outlook for continued gridlock. The legislative landscape has the potential to shift direction as fast as a presidential tweet. Congress There is an abundance of historical precedent for partisan gridlock to lead to legislative inaction. In fact, recent history seems to prove true the old adage asking ‘what does Congress do well? Nothing and overreacting.’ The 112th and 113th Congresses (2011-2014), which featured a Democratic-controlled White House and Senate and Republican-controlled House (an inverse of the current political makeup), were the least productive in modern history with 284 and 296 laws enacted, respectively. Those numbers pale in comparison to the 115th Congress (2017-2018), which enacted 440 laws when Republicans had unified control of the government. In the current Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has referred to himself as the legislative “Grim Reaper,” saying that much, if not all, of the House Democrats' policy agenda will be dead on arrival in the GOP-controlled Senate. Moreover, President Trump has indicated he will not work with Democrats on major legislative initiatives as long as they pursue oversight investigations into him and his administration, throwing cold water on hopes for such bipartisan compromises as infrastructure. For nearly a decade, Congress has legislated by deadline and that trend seems unlikely to abate anytime soon. Accordingly, our clients should look toward must-pass legislation as a guide for what is to come. The most significant piece of legislation that needs to pass before the August recess is the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The bill is traditionally viewed as must-pass and is historically bipartisan in nature. Retirement security, drug pricing and infrastructure also continue to be bipartisan concepts in nature, but finding a path forward on any of these items continues to be a challenge. Congress is also working on crafting bipartisan comprehensive privacy legislation, but whether to include a federal standard that preempts state law, in particular the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), has become a contentious issue. Further complicating negotiations are the multiple committees that share jurisdiction over data privacy legislation. As lawmakers narrow their focus on data privacy and data governance issues, technology firms are becoming acutely exposed to increasing regulation and a fragmented environment. In fact, the House Judiciary Committee recently opened an antitrust investigation into big tech companies. We expect to see continued efforts around the regulation of big tech companies, whether through the form of privacy laws, hateful content restrictions or competition probes. New privacy regulations in particular could extend to financial institutions as well, depending on how they are crafted. Under the gavel of Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), the House Financial Services Committee has turned its attention from financial deregulation to consumer protections, housing finance, workers’ rights, diversity and inclusion, oversight and anti-money laundering efforts, among others. The committee also recently formed task forces to examine new technologies, focusing specifically on fintech and artificial intelligence. As we look toward the fall, Congress faces a number of potential economic uncertainties on the horizon: Rising concern over a trade resolution with China; a battle over ratifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA); potential North American Free Trade Agreement withdrawal; and a showdown over government funding and the debt limit. Government funding is set to expire on September 30, around the same time the Treasury Department has said they will be unable to use extraordinary measures to pay the country’s debt. Global Economists project that US trade policies, particularly the Trump administration’s use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool, are creating market uncertainties that risk denting US growth and adding to headwinds that could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the next year. Those uncertainties were recently epitomized when President Trump announced late last month that he would impose a 5% tariff on all goods from Mexico unless its leaders took steps to curb illegal immigration into the US. The threat was rescinded last week after an agreement was reached with the Mexican government. The president's tariff threat was a reminder how quickly US foreign policy can shift under the current administration, but it also highlighted the administration’s use of tariffs as an effective foreign policy tool. Many lawmakers remain optimistic about USMCA ratification prospects, but business leaders would be wise to prepare for more twists and turns. Issues around border security, enforceability of labor and environmental standards, as well as labor union support are all issues that need to be ironed out. Procedurally, the Trump administration has initiated the process for expedited consideration of the USMCA by submitting a formal Statement of Administrative Action, but the earliest the implementing bill could be sent to Congress is July. This is a significant development, particularly in light of Mexico and Canada’s recent steps toward ratification. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland presented a motion to begin the ratification process for the trade deal, while Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has asked their legislative body to hold a special session before September to formally approve the USMCA. On another trade front, the expectation (or hope) for greater clarity around the US-China trade dispute may be realized this month at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The two countries have traded escalating tariffs, with China imposing levies of 5% to 25% on $60 billion worth of US goods in response to President Trump raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods last month. President Trump also gave the EU and Japan 180 days to agree to a deal that would “limit” or “restrict” imports of cars and parts into the US as a move to delay new auto tariffs. Analysts worry the latest tariff escalation will drive up the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation, and a further acceleration could have a greater impact on economic growth. If the US, China and other countries continue to raise retaliatory tariffs, the negative effects may no longer be confined to a handful of industries in the US, but instead risk being felt around the globe. Across the pond, trade complications continue in Europe. British lawmakers continue to struggle on a path forward for Brexit. After the negotiated agreement by Prime Minister Theresa May failed to pass for a fourth time, May announced her resignation effective June 7, triggering a leadership contest. Further complicating matters are the recent European parliamentary elections which resulted in the victory of populist candidates in several countries, including a number from the hardline UK Independence Party. US leaders will be watching closely this summer. In addition to Brexit concerns, the UK Parliament’s Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy Committee issued a 100-page report in April on the future of audit. The report includes a number of recommendations, including separating the UK audit and non-audit businesses. These recommendations are the beginning of the process, however, and there are other reviews, some still underway, and future opportunities for input. PwC UK announced this month a package of measures designed to ensure high quality audits, including further alignment of its audit and risk assurance practices, creating a practice with a single focus on external audit and strengthening its governance with their Independent Non-Executives, among other measures. SEC/FASB At the SEC, Commissioners recently voted to propose amendments that would revise the definitions of “accelerated filer” and “large accelerated filer,” essentially expanding the population of public companies that are non-accelerated filers. Under the proposal, companies (subject to some exceptions) that have a public float between $75 million and $700 million, and revenues of less than $100 million, would become non-accelerated filers and would, therefore, be exempt from auditor attestation required under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. The comment period for the proposal closes in July. The Commission also recently adopted its own standard of conduct rules that require brokers and other salespeople to act in the best interests of their customers when making recommendations about investments, as well as to disclose potential conflicts of interest to their customers. Some of the rules will become effective immediately, while others will become effective 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register, and will include a transition period until June 30, 2020. The Senate Banking Committee held a confirmation hearing on June 5 for Allison Lee, nominee for the open Democratic commissioner slot at the SEC, and the committee and full Senate may vote to confirm her as early as this month. It has been reported that Commissioner Robert Jackson may also step down as soon as Lee is confirmed, creating another Democratic vacancy at the Commission. Additionally, following the announcement that former PwC partner and Chief Accountant Wes Bricker planned to leave the agency this month, the SEC named Sagar Teotia as acting Chief Accountant. Teotia, who formerly served as Deputy Chief Accountant, will now serve as the principal advisor to the Commission on accounting and auditing matters, and will be responsible for assisting the Commission with discharging its oversight of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). US lawmakers also have shown a growing interest in FASB’s Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) standard. Bipartisan letters in both the House and the Senate and legislation in the Senate have called for the standard to be studied further and delayed for up to two years. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has encouraged FASB to engage with stakeholders to assess the potential impact of implementation on different sized institutions. State and local While some state legislatures are winding down their legislative sessions, others are just getting going. Only five states will hold statewide elections in 2019: Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi will elect new governors, while Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Virginia will hold legislative elections. Two major issues caught our attention in state legislatures this year: taxation of professional services and anti-arbitration initiatives. Twelve states saw the introduction of legislation that would expand the sales and use tax base to professional services, including accounting. To date, 22 “taxation of services” bills have been introduced in California, Connecticut, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. Despite the number of states exploring the issue, none have successfully implemented a broad sales tax expansion to services yet. California and Connecticut saw serious efforts to explore this issue this year, but both efforts appear stalled at this point in time. Legislatures across the country also continue to introduce bills that would curtail or bar the use of arbitration in employment agreements. Some measures would ban only the concealment of sexual harassment settlements or limit arbitration in discrimination or sexual harassment disputes, while others seek to ban arbitration in employment contracts altogether. New Jersey became the first state to enact a total ban on employment arbitration agreements earlier this year, a measure which may be in conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act and US Supreme Court precedent. California and Illinois are actively considering similar legislation. And in Colorado, an effort to move an anti-arbitration bill failed this session in the face of opposition from the business community. Conclusion Eight years ago this spring, several newly-elected freshman House members taped a letter on the door of the then Senate Majority Leader demanding that he act on several pieces of key legislation that the House had already passed. These newly-elected members declared that “the American people did not send us here to fail and we do not accept your failure as our own.” The newly-elected freshmen were part of the GOP majority that took over after the 2010 election and the Majority Leader was former Senator Harry Reid (D-NV). Reid chose to ignore the House GOP agenda in an attempt to protect his incumbent president ahead of the next election. Reid’s strategy worked as President Obama was easily reelected and Democrats even gained seats in the Senate. Although many of the players have changed in the last eight years, the current dynamic is almost a mirror image with inverse party control. Similarly to back then, most near-term activity in Washington will be amplified through the political lens of the 2020 presidential race. In less than two weeks, the first of six Democratic presidential debates this year will take place in Miami. With 23 credible Democratic candidates running as of this writing, the most since 1924, the upcoming presidential debates have the potential to provide some clarity around front runners and newcomers. While 23 candidates seems like a lot, and it is, Republicans fielded 16 candidates at this point last election cycle. In fact, Donald Trump did not officially enter the race until June 16, 2015. Given November 2020 is more than 17 months away, it is understandable one might view the election as a distant, far-off event. But with California moving up its primary date, 40% of all delegates will now be allocated by the end of March. And although the presidential race may be the headline grabber, 31 House Democrats will be up for reelection in districts carried by President Trump, compared to just three Republicans in districts carried by Secretary Clinton, putting Democrats’ current 38-seat majority at stake. In the Senate, Democrats have 12 seats to defend compared to 22 seats for Republicans. That number may be misleading, however, as Democrats will need a net gain of three seats if their party’s nominee beats President Trump in November and a four-seat pickup if the president is reelected (due to the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote). Only in two of the last five elections has either party picked up more than three Senate seats. The lone indisputable fact is that no one knows what event or factor may ultimately take place between now and the election that could significantly alter the 2020 landscape. In the near term, however, expect the “oversight vs. overreach” dynamic and legislative stagnation to continue to dominate the political climate, even if the effects are not fully realized for some time.

As of July 1, the SDCs supporting the US firm will officially be known as Acceleration Centers (ACs) — but there’s much more happening than just a name change. This transformation includes standardizing and automating the work done in our Service Delivery Centers, expanding Your Tomorrow to include our SDC teams and enhancing the ways we work together on engagements. Today, 13,000 SDC staff in eight locations around the world work with individual lines of service in the US and other member firms. These teams are already critical to helping us deliver enhanced quality to our clients while we drive down time and cost of delivery. They provide a wide range of capabilities and services, including core compliance, transfer pricing and other specialized services for Tax; substantive testing, manual controls testing and other audit, attest, and non-audit related services for Assurance; technology, management, risk and strategy consulting services for Advisory; and various support services for IFS teams including Network Information Security, Marketing &amp; Sales and Ethics &amp; Compliance. Now, as we transform and digitize our business, we’ll implement the same strategy and approaches we are already familiar with and working on as a firm to transform our centers to support our new, digital way of working. What does this mean to you? One way this is already happening is through our use of Phoenix for requesting and managing work performed by our ACs. We've been moving toward using Phoenix on 100% of our engagements with ACs and this journey continues. As those of you who are familiar with Phoenix already know, this is a big step forward in terms of consistency and standardization -- and making it simpler to work with the ACs. Our lines of service are working with the PwC Labs teams and the Acceleration Center Strategy Team (formerly our Global Delivery Model Services team) to automate and scale LoS services in the ACs. Watch for more details from your line of service. We’ve been upskilling our AC teams to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation, and so our AC staff have the digital acumen they need to seamlessly work with our engagement teams as we increase the use of digital tools. Nearly 10,000 AC staff have completed Digital Academies and other advanced technology training, and a dedicated Digital Leader and team at each center drive automation and upskilling activities. You’ll be hearing more from your line of service in the coming weeks and months about other steps we’re taking to work more seamlessly with our ACs. Stay tuned!

The goal was to identify ways to optimize the volumes of sales, marketing and customer relationship data M&amp;S works with every day — specifically the data that feeds their Eloqua marketing automation system — by applying PwC’s Data Governance Framework. Kimberly Frazier, CDO senior associate and Digital Accelerator, brought a consultative approach to working with Paul McInnis and Edward Rodriguez from the M&amp;S team. As they do with all the teams they partner with, the CDO worked to understand the M&amp;S team’s challenges, listened closely to drill down into the specific areas where their processes could improve, and identified bite-sized steps they could take toward further optimizing their data governance. Building from a model Kimberly developed to pinpoint anomalies in large data sets, the team was able to immediately automate their data cleansing process, saving weeks of time. While working with Kimberly and the CDO, Paul and Edward both attended Digital Academies. Edward was able to apply his Digital Academy learning to take Kimberly’s foundational process automations and expand their application to even more areas, finding opportunities to standardize data formatting, eliminate unnecessary data and consolidate duplications. With some digital mentoring from Kimberly, Paul and Edward have opened the door to continue improving their data processes in a tangible and practical way. Kudos to this team for empowering themselves to apply what they’ve learned! Want to collaborate with the CDO? The CDO is here to partner and consult with teams to help them identify the most valuable data, automations and processes to optimize use of our firm’s data assets. Reach out to the CDO to request a consultation.

Prior to the launch of the new system, extensive testing needed to occur to confirm that the system was suited to the client’s unique needs. Testing of this nature can be very time consuming and repetitive — especially for customer-facing applications — so the Advisory team worked with their Digital Accelerator Scott Upchurch on innovative ways to digitize the routine tasks. In addition, every member of the team attended a Digital Academy to improve their digital skills and support their team collaboration. “Everyone on the team really caught the fever of digital acceleration,” said Scott. “We constantly discussed new ideas for bots and ways to automate routine tasks in our work for the client to not only improve the way we work, but to keep our work exciting.” The team developed three new solutions to help reduce the time needed to test the client’s new system: The Test Data Bot for use during trials of mass uploads of customer account information, which reduced the time required by the team to test data by 85%; The Status Reporter Workflow to generate daily reporting emails by calculating key metrics and outputs from data in a Google Sheet, which reduced the team’s manual reconciliation efforts by 95%; and The Universal Reconciliation Application that can reconcile data between any two data sets and generate a report for all unmatched and matched data to help validate source and destination system data, which reduced the team’s manual reconciliation efforts by 90%. New Digital Lab solution coming soon! In total, the team saved more than 217 hours and developed a solution to share in Digital Lab! The Universal Reconciliation Application solution should be available later this month, so check back soon to access it. Until then, continue to hone your digital skills to improve your team collaboration by attending a Digital Academy or Digital Lab Immersion session — click here for information on which session to attend and how to register. Also, it’s important to remember this is a different conversation for our audit and non-audit clients. For our audit clients and their affiliates, please follow independence rules and obtain appropriate audit committee pre-approvals, where applicable.

Smart Platform is a great example of how teaming across the PwC network brought a Business-led automation to life that will further enhance quality and reduce manual hours. Financial Statement Tie-Out is the second largest Assurance activity performed by the ACs. Through our close partnership with the Manila AC and exploration of digital solutions, the PwC US Assurance team learned that PwC Australia had developed an early-stage automation solution to assist in testing Financial Statement mathematical accuracy. They then teamed with PwC Australia to co-develop Smart Platform, a more sophisticated platform to handle the complexity of US Financial Statements and to accelerate the automation of new functionality in order to further reduce manual involvement. Smart Platform uses algorithms and AI machine learning to re-perform the calculations in each table of a Financial Statement. Going forward, the ACs will use this tool on all Financial Statements that meet the tool criteria. Up next -- the Smart Platform will facilitate a significant increase in the automation of agreeing Prior Year amounts and performing Internal Consistency between the financial statements and footnotes. These automations are expected to further enhance quality and reduce manual hours in the ACs year over year while increasing the speed at which the ACs can support engagement teams. What you can do? Continue to take advantage of business- and citizen-led innovation and work with ACs to automate and scale LoS services.

This change would require the team to apply several layers of filters and vlookups by jurisdiction and legal entities in order to agree deferred tax balances to the trial balance. Instead of spending hours performing these tasks manually, they quickly engaged a Digital Accelerator to prepare a workflow that allowed them to input specific legal entities and have the workflow apply the filters/vlookups. This produced two impactful results -- first, the workflow agreed the deferred tax balances to the trial balance by legal entity, and second, it saved the team a significant amount of time sorting trial balances to produce this result. By saving approximately 10% of the total tax provision hours during one of the most crucial weeks of year-end fieldwork, members of the team could be redeployed on more complex technical tax matters. But the PwC team wasn’t done innovating. As a result of US tax reform, the Tax team also faced some complex technical matters related to uncertain tax positions (UTP). The client had spent months creating a file detailing the multiple, intertwined UTP positions. Once again, the PwC team leveraged the Digital Accelerators in their work to create a workflow to recompute the various scenarios considered in the UTP analysis which allowed the team to do the work in a tenth of the time while maintaining a high-level of audit quality. Additionally, in future periods this workflow will be able to be leveraged to assess the tax accounting impact of UTP settlements or other indirect impacts on the transition tax.

Private Company Services (PCS) became the first within Assurance to access the Digital Lab back in August of 2018. At that time, Digital Lab launched with only 20 managed Assurance-specific digital assets. Over time, it began to amass more and more automations -- today it has grown to over 600. This made sifting through the vast number of digital assets time consuming. Recognizing Digital Lab’s ability to make a difference for our people and teams through the powerful solutions shared on the site, a group of five PCS Assurance Digital Accelerators decided to compartmentalize the experience and make the audit-specific automations both accessible and explorable -- and created the PCS Audit Map, a comprehensive Digital Lab ‘Collection’. The team worked closely with a Digital Lab team to learn how to build the PCS Audit Map and make it as user-friendly as possible. The team also collaborated with Auditing Services, Methods and Tools (ASM&amp;T) to ensure the Audit Map is aligned with PwC policy and methodology. This PCS Audit Map launched in July and currently contains over 200 automations. Much like the Digital Lab, new automations are constantly being added so they’ll periodically reevaluate the content that they’ve curated to confirm they’re leveraging the best solutions Digital Lab has to offer. The delivery map is already being used to assist in PCS audits and has received great feedback, and the team is promoting it across the practice. To date, as part of the PCS Digital Roadshow, they’ve visited over 30 offices across the firm with plans to visit more in the coming weeks. Paul Sheward - the Assurance Digital Lab lead partner commented “We believe that there are significant benefits for our Assurance professionals from using Collections - and we will have many more available to the practice in the coming months. The PCS Audit Map has set the bar!” See this team’s work in action and check out the PCS Audit Map in the Digital Lab today!

Since then, our two recent Autom-a-thons have sparked ideas for dozens of automations that will save you and the firm thousands of hours while maintaining audit quality. What’s an ‘Autom-a-thon’? These are half-day hackathons where teams work together to come up with automation ideas and minimal viable products (MVP). PwCers on the Washington Metro Advisory council wanted to be part of the digital revolution after they attended the Digital Academy, but wanted to practice their skills. So they came together to host the first digital hackathon in the McLean office. Teams came together to ideate with the support of Digital Accelerators, and at the end of four hours, the eight teams had eight unique automation ideas to help our firm operate more efficiently. With five of these ideas on the way to being uploaded to Digital Lab, and a potential 620+ hours saved with the collective one-time use of these automations, other markets took notice. It was so successful that the Mid-Atlantic market council strategically decided to take the Autom-a-thon idea to Philadelphia and try it as a One Firm event. The Washington Metro staff Advisory council team went on the road and coached some Philadelphia staff council members and Digital Accelerators through the Autom-a-thon. Creating connectivity across the firm, the Philly event was open to all LoS, staff levels, and technical skill levels -- and those that had an idea they didn’t know how to build, those that wanted to try to build for the first time, those that want to build more but don’t have the dedicated time. Philadelphia-based partners served as first round judges with USLT members serving as the final round judges. The nine unique automations proposed would not only improve our value proposition to our clients and increase firm productivity, but could potentially save about 14,000 self-reported hours with collective use across the firm. The top three team pitches were: Autovengers (Members: Associates Girum Idiris and Taylor Leonard) -- Every single one of us has had to go through firm onboarding. Let’s build a suite of bots that help with these universal onboarding activities, like setting up direct deposit, requesting an AmEx, etc., to take out countless manual, non-engagement hours. Scrubs (Members: Associate Ellis Driscoll and senior associate Jay Rodriguez) -- Scrubbing out client data and sensitive information from assets for uploading to Digital Lab or sharing can be time-consuming, by automating this process we can save 2-6 hours per asset. Need a name bot (Members: Associate Chris Kersey and intern Alex Dean) -- When introduced to a new engagement or statement of work (SOW), we need to start leveraging what is on Digital Lab at the onset. This bot will search your SOW for keywords to input into Digital Lab to deliver recommended assets for you. Tim said it himself, “Folks - you amazed me and inspired me - wow!!! Thank you for making Your Tomorrow real!!! Keep on automating!!” What can I do?

The goal was for Google, which had previously relied heavily on spreadsheets, to be able to manage their enormous volume of data more easily and efficiently. Our PwC Tax team helped the Google tax team move from simple journal entry automation to automating some of their most complex processes around forecasting, tax account reconciliations and tax reform. Various data wrangling tools, including internal Google tools, were employed, giving our PwC team the opportunity to gain new digital knowledge from the client as well. “While we had experience with certain self service data automation tools going in,” said PwC Tax Manager Aaron Lan, “I enjoy learning how to use new tools because they make you better equipped to use the next one that comes out. And as you go along, you can dig deeper into what each tool can do.” After the PwC team showed the Google team the value of moving away from manual spreadsheets, the team introduced Google to data visualizations so they could derive new insights from the data. Teaming as One Firm In addition to PwC’s Tax team, there are PwC Risk Assurance and Advisory teams also on site at Google. Sitting in close proximity makes it only natural that the teams get to know each other and learn the Google tech space together. And they’re bringing our One Firm strategy to life by piloting a One Firm team to look at automation opportunities across our delivery model.

You’ll take a deep dive into our strategic priorities — including quality and citizen-led innovation — as you learn more about the existing tools and technologies you can use to further enhance quality and tech-enable your audit. The event series kicked off on June 4 in Kansas City. We caught up with Lead Planner, Manager Garett Brown, to hear about how the inaugural Your Tomorrow Live! went. “The event was great! It was very interactive, allowing for a lot of attendee participation with presenters both on stage and in the expo. Attendees got to see how the new digital tools actually work through live demonstrations and real life assurance examples.” Lead Planner for the Dallas FS meeting, Director Matthew Schwatz, agreed. “Your Tomorrow Live! was a great event. It was high energy and very interactive. Seeing live demonstrations of some of the new tools and technology that we’ll be implementing should have everyone in Assurance excited for what the future has in store.” Their advice on why you should attend? “It’s an immersive experience you don’t ordinarily get to share with your colleagues. You get to watch our strategy come to life in a fun way.” And the proof is in the photos. Your Tomorrow Live! is rolling out to core assurance and process assurance teams in markets nationwide over ten weeks, from June through early August.

Are you ready? Phoenix goes live in just 3 days. Are you ready? Assurance Aug. 9, 2019 Next week brings a new opportunity to standardize and simplify the way you work. On Monday, August 12, engagement teams can work even smarter and more efficiently with Phoenix, PwC’s workflow platform. Phoenix replaces Envoy and enhances the way we engage with our Acceleration Centers (ACs) and Centers of Excellence (COEs). It’s just one of the ways we're digitizing our business to enhance quality and increase productivity as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy in Assurance. Now, here’s what you should do to make sure your team is prepared to begin using this new platform. Link your active and archived prior year Aura databases to your Phoenix profile. This linkage is critical for the automated process of granting AC and CoE staff assigned to your engagements access to your Aura databases. Add your AC (formerly, GDM) and COE WBS codes to your Phoenix profile. Important reminder: You will no longer be able to initiate requests in Envoy effective August 12*. All reservations and requests with due dates on or after September 1 have been moved to Phoenix**. Your requests with due dates on or prior to August 31 will still be delivered in Envoy. If the reservations or requests did not move over to Phoenix as you expected, first contact your AC team members. If they are unable to resolve your questions, you can contact ac.delivery.operations@us.pwc.com. *Exceptions to the August deployment include Risk Assurance service categories relating to the RA Tech tool support services and the DRS - Journal Entry analysis for audit support. These service offerings will be available in Phoenix subsequent to the September release. **You may begin to receive auto-generated notifications from Phoenix for reservations and requests moved to Phoenix on your behalf; there is no action required by you in response to these notifications. Still have questions? You can refer to Phoenix Guidance and find more information on the Phoenix Spark page. Technical questions should be directed to PwC Help. As we continue to reimagine the possible and explore new ways to tech-enable the audit, look for new enhancements to the tool throughout the course of the next year.

I’m truly honored to succeed Maria in the role of Assurance leader and to have the opportunity to work with you all. Thanks to your hard work, we’ve made a lot of progress, and you should all be very proud. We have expanded our use of technology and our digital skills, while growing our business through our focus on providing quality audits. I’m excited to build on this momentum in FY20, and I plan to spend time in these early months listening and connecting with our teams and clients. I know PwC, and yet I am coming in fresh to this role. Here’s a little about me: I’m a PwC boomerang, a dad of three, and a native of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. A former PwC Assurance partner, I served as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chief Accountant beginning in 2016. This is a great firm and a first-rate practice, and I’m thrilled to be back! I believe passionately in the role we play as a purpose-driven organization in the capital markets, adding trust in the financial reporting system and contributing to the strength of organizations and our economies. My goal is to help us maintain our positive momentum, and to keep our Assurance practice strong and relevant. I look forward to working together to execute our firmwide strategy, and I’ll be in touch soon!

That’s why we’re always upgrading our tools, to further enhance quality and help you work smarter as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy in Assurance. Here are the latest tool enhancements along with what’s coming next month. -------------------------- Aura Platinum is here and we have received valuable feedback and questions around the tool. Check out these tips based on trending questions we’ve heard so far: Trying to search the view? A new search function is coming later this summer - stay tuned! Looking for Engagement Checks in Aura Platinum? These will be available later in 2019, along with the Ready for Archive flag, and gmail import. Watch for these coming soon. Setting up the mapping of Connect requests to EGAs? This can be done using the “Manage Dependencies” feature in Workflow view. Check out these resources for further assistance or leverage the Acceleration Center. Link Connect to your Aura engagement and link Connect requests to your EGAs.

The App Jumper also provides access to EMW, A&amp;C, the TEA Tool Finder and more! We appreciate your feedback and ideas. Continue to use the Aura Feedback button in the tool to leave your comments and questions. -------------------------- Phoenix launches across Assurance on August 12. The new workflow platform will replace Envoy and allows teams to request, receive and manage resources from our Acceleration Centers. Read more about what your team should do now to prepare to transition to Phoenix. -------------------------- Revenue Insights allows eligible engagement teams transform data into interactive dashboards designed to help audit teams better understand, evaluate, and risk assess the processes and controls in the revenue cycle. We've recently released several enhancements that expand what the tool has to offer - and we've got many more on the way later this summer. Check out the TEA Tool Finder to see if Revenue Insights is right for you. -------------------------- Enhanced Central Entity Service (CES) and Authorization for Service (AFS) — our tools to manage restricted clients and authorize services we provide them — launch later this summer.

To reflect these changes, our SDCs will now be called Acceleration Centers (AC) as previously announced. The goal: to further enhance quality through standardization, drive consistency in execution, and enable a more tech-enabled experience for our teams and clients. It’s a key part of how we’re accelerating our future in Assurance. Here are 3 ways this change can help your teams: AC resources will now be eligible to mark EGAs as prepared and reviewed in certain situations. Final review remains with the engagement team or CoE. Certain activities the AC resources can perform to support substantive testing have been enhanced to reflect tasks requiring no more than a limited level of professional judgment. Certain operational protocols for use of the ACs have been simplified. For more information and to start accelerating our future, watch this brief video, consult Audit Advisor 19/13, and read the Acceleration Center guide for engagement teams and CoEs available on the Acceleration Center Strategy US Assurance Spark page. Note: There is no change to the Remote Team Member (RTM) model for certain PCS and ECS engagements.

Knowing audit tools and innovations inside and out helps you and your team further enhance our audit quality and deliver value through insights — all part of our Your Tomorrow strategy in Assurance. If you’re performing multilocation audit scoping on your engagement, don’t snooze on Halo for MLA Scoping. This tool allows you to automate the preparation of your multilocation scoping quantitative analysis. Read more from Maggie Allin -- she says this tool is a “must-have” for the Cigna team. “Halo for MLA Scoping is incredibly useful, especially its ability to quickly change our audit scoping and see the impact on our untested balance in real-time. This is particularly helpful for our team since we have over 70 components on our engagement. Additionally, we use the visual aids within the tool to help us explore different scenarios and drive discussion about the quantitative and qualitative considerations.” Maggie Allin Manager Citizen innovators are helping teams get even more out of this tool. Learn about the “Audit Committee Report Scoping Summary Bot” available on Digital Lab to help multilocation Engagement Teams who have used Halo for MLA scoping during audit planning to prepare their Audit Committee Communications.

Engagement teams will use Phoenix to request, receive and manage resources and services from our Acceleration Centers (ACs), which can now help your teams in 3 new ways. Phoenix replaces Envoy, which we’ll sunset later this year. This tool represents just one more way we’re tech-enabling the audit and digitizing our business as part of our Your Tomorrow strategy. Important: Take action to prepare to transition to Phoenix Until July 26, continue to use GEM to create new engagement profiles and complete your AC Checklist. GEM is integrated with Phoenix so all engagement profiles created in GEM will be accessible in Phoenix. Starting right away, once your engagement profile is visible in Phoenix, link your active and archived prior year Aura databases to the Phoenix profile. Here is how. This linkage is critical for the process of granting AC and COE users access to the databases. Between August 5-12, all in-process requests and reservations entered into Envoy will be transferred to Phoenix for you. If you won’t need support of the ACs prior to August 12, we recommend waiting until Phoenix goes live to make new reservations. Visit our Phoenix site for a wealth of support tools, training and resources, including detailed instructions for getting started.

landing page for multi column component dfds fsdfsd dfsdafsdfsd Another multi column with header Every day, we spend hours looking at our laptops, reading from our tablets and gazing at our phones. The fatigue this places on our eyes, coupled with the fact that our eyes are always changing, makes regular vision exams an essential component of our personal well-being. PwC’s EyeMed vision care plan and the new Know Before You Go cost transparency tool can help us stay healthy and manage our personal healthcare spending. Know Before You Go If you’re enrolled in PwC’s vision care plan, consider scheduling an eye exam – you’re eligible for one each year. The plan also includes a Video Display Terminal benefit for partners and staff (not available to covered dependents), which covers a screening, completed along with your regular exam, and lenses specifically designed to address eye strain and fatigue associated with computer use. While you’re considering making an appointment, think about how you can minimize your personal expenses. Search for an eye doctor with the location and hours that work for you. You’ll experience the greatest cost savings when you use EyeMed in-network providers. Your cost is also affected by whether you need contact lenses or glasses, and any special coatings or add-ons. Plus, while you’re logged into the EyeMed site, you can find additional savings opportunities by clicking on “Special Offers” at the top of the page. To get a feel for the expenses you might incur before your appointment, log into the Know Before you Go tool and get an estimate. Log into your EyeMed account and click “Know Before You Go” in the top dropdown menu. Choose from exams and a variety of lens types, options and add-ons. Plus, get detailed descriptions of each product so you feel confident in your choices. View a range of costs based on your choices and vision benefits. If you’re not currently enrolled in vision care, you’ll have an opportunity to elect coverage during the Annual Enrollment period in May, for coverage effective July 1. Bonus: You can earn Well-Being Rewards points The Well-Being Rewards Program provides an added incentive of 300 points per year for having your routine eye exam. Remember, you’ll need to enter your exam details in the Virgin Pulse desktop site in order to claim your points. Questions For more information about how the plan works: Call an EyeMed representative at (877) PwC-1863 (877-792-1863). Visit the EyeMed website at eyemedvisioncare.com/pwc.

Top News Right rail muli column Every day, we spend hours looking at our laptops, reading from our tablets and gazing at our phones. The fatigue this places on our eyes, coupled with the fact that our eyes are always changing, makes regular vision exams an essential component of our personal well-being. PwC’s EyeMed vision care plan and the new Know Before You Go cost transparency tool can help us stay healthy and manage our personal healthcare spending. Know Before You Go If you’re enrolled in PwC’s vision care plan, consider scheduling an eye exam – you’re eligible for one each year. The plan also includes a Video Display Terminal benefit for partners and staff (not available to covered dependents), which covers a screening, completed along with your regular exam, and lenses specifically designed to address eye strain and fatigue associated with computer use. While you’re considering making an appointment, think about how you can minimize your personal expenses. Search for an eye doctor with the location and hours that work for you. You’ll experience the greatest cost savings when you use EyeMed in-network providers. Your cost is also affected by whether you need contact lenses or glasses, and any special coatings or add-ons. Plus, while you’re logged into the EyeMed site, you can find additional savings opportunities by clicking on “Special Offers” at the top of the page. To get a feel for the expenses you might incur before your appointment, log into the Know Before you Go tool and get an estimate. Log into your EyeMed account and click “Know Before You Go” in the top dropdown menu. Choose from exams and a variety of lens types, options and add-ons. Plus, get detailed descriptions of each product so you feel confident in your choices. View a range of costs based on your choices and vision benefits. If you’re not currently enrolled in vision care, you’ll have an opportunity to elect coverage during the Annual Enrollment period in May, for coverage effective July 1. Bonus: You can earn Well-Being Rewards points The Well-Being Rewards Program provides an added incentive of 300 points per year for having your routine eye exam. Remember, you’ll need to enter your exam details in the Virgin Pulse desktop site in order to claim your points. Questions For more information about how the plan works: Call an EyeMed representative at (877) PwC-1863 (877-792-1863). Visit the EyeMed website at eyemedvisioncare.com/pwc.

Do yourself a favor by verifying (and updating, if necessary) your personal information — but act now! Any changes must be completed no later than Friday, Dec. 13 by 11:59 p.m. ET to avoid tax-time corrections, which have to be handled on your own as part of your personal tax return. Here’s how to verify your W-2 withholdings, multi-state allocations and other personal information: Visit Workday to verify your mailing and home address(es). (While you’re at it, make sure all personal information, including your emergency contact info, is current.) Keep in mind, your “home” address determines your resident state and local tax withholding status. If you have changed residency during the year and your home address is not correct, update it now so all future paychecks will be taxed appropriately. Visit the ADP Payroll Services Portal to verify federal, state and local wages are being reported on your pay statements, including multi-state allocations. Visit myMetrics for a snapshot view of your time reported working in other states. From myMetrics, select Employee 360 &gt; Time &amp; Expense &gt; Time Detail &gt; Charged Tax Areas. If you find you need to change any time allocations, you can correct those up to four periods back in Mobile Time. What else? The IRS’ new Tax Withholding Estimator is now more accurate and realigned with payroll withholding tables. It’s a helpful tool to review regularly and see if you need to update your withholding for your remaining 2019 pay, or when planning ahead for 2020 to align your withholding with your personal tax liability. Want to switch from receiving paper to electronic W-2 forms for your taxes? ADP Payroll Services lets you opt out of printed W-2 forms (Pay &amp; Taxes &gt; Go Paperless). Choose this option before Dec. 30 to receive paperless forms for 2019. Download the ADP Mobile Solutions app from PwC’s App Store to easily view pay statements and more. Next year, don’t wait! Make it a habit to check and update your personal information in Workday regularly, or any time you have a change. Questions?

A look at today’s landscape and the potential impact on the firm and our clients. Central banks have cited geopolitical uncertainty as a critical risk to the US and global economies, including uncertainty due to unresolved trade disputes and perceived instability in the Middle East, Iran, Hong Kong, China and North Korea. Both in the US and abroad, analysts continue to highlight that many businesses will slow investing due to ongoing uncertainty with respect to China trade policy. Moreover, the negative economic consequences of tariffs to US businesses and consumers will continue to unfold. Yet the US economy is undergoing the longest economic expansion in the post World War II era, and many economic indicators, such as unemployment, labor force participation rates and wages, are at historic levels (or at least seeing major improvements over the recent past).

The Human Resources Shared Services Center’s (HR SSC) new Deployment Enablement Team (DET) now has responsibility for specific deployment activities, in collaboration with the LoS deployment teams. What does this mean for me? The DET supports our LoS deployment teams to schedule staff for projects, in line with our utilization and revenue goals. Your TalentLink and T&amp;E schedules (personal and for your engagements) are key to making this work, so it’s important to keep them up-to-date. The DET, which will work as an extension of the LoS deployment teams you work with today, will reach out directly to you for time that was not captured in GFS, variances between TalentLink and GFS, and staffing confirmations. What you need to do: Respond to these requests as needed. The DET will also approve/update your TalentLink booking requests. What you need to do: Continue to use the appropriate tools for requesting updates to your TalentLink schedule (see details in LoS sections below); you may risk rejection if your schedule isn't current. The DET will process all requests within 24 hours and work closely with LoS Deployment Consultants on required actions. (Note: Delays may occur during the first few weeks of transition.) As part of our overall simplification efforts, we have greatly reduced our list of non-chargeable TalentLink Job Names xLoS. What you need to do (Assr &amp; Tax only): Immediately begin using this new list of non-chargeable job names. Note: This file has been updated; please review for the most up-to-date listings and guidance. Each LoS team is in a different place in this optimization journey; please click here for LoS details. This is an important step in our One Firm journey and providing opportunities and streamlined scheduling for you.

PwC Technology March 24, 2018 Google has updated the look and features of Google Calendar, and US IT is making the transition as easy as possible for the US firm. Check out the new features and highlights of the new Google Calendar -- plus all the resources available to help you make the most of technology. Easier access: Click once on an event to see details at a glance. Plus, launching calls, meetings or video calls is just a click away. Rich formatting: Add formatted text and hyperlinks to your Calendar invites. Link to relevant Drive files and open them directly from the new “Event Detail” view. This helps you create more detailed agendas and make sure all materials are in one place. Manage multiple calendars side-by-side: View and manage colleagues’ calendars in separate columns. This makes it easier for those who manage multiple calendars to schedule meetings on behalf of their teams. In “Day” view, click “Add a coworker’s calendar” to select the calendars you want to compare. Enhanced invitation status: Events look different depending on your response status: solid colors = attending; diagonal lines = maybe; outlined = not replied; outlined and crossed out = declined. When exploring the new calendar features, remember this tip for sending Google Calendar invitations: Be sure to copy call details into the description box. If a recipient views it on an iPhone or iPad, they may not see all information. We’re working with Apple and Google to change the way this works. Have you tried the Calendar Event Assistant? Need an easy way to add WebEx, AT&amp;T and other call information to Google Calendar invites?

Only you can affix your electronic signature. You may not give your electronic signature to anyone else. 2. Only sign final documents - do not put your electronic signature on draft documents. 3. When using your ePen you must "flatten" and secure your electronic signature after you affix it to a document to prevent anyone else from being able to easily copy it. The Tax Policy: Signatures and Alternative Signature Methods specifies that electronic signatures can be used, however signers must personally affix their signature. Signers using alternative signature methods remain responsible for the quality and correctness of the document being signed. The policy also provides that you must follow the prescribed processes for preventing the electronic signature from being altered, copied, or edited. This means when using your ePen you must "flatten" and secure the document. The instructions are in the Quick Reference Guide: ePen for Tax - Adobe Acrobat XI Professional. Finally, if you encounter an electronic signature that is not flattened, then (a) delete it, and/or (b) send it to signer for inspection, based upon what makes sense under the circumstances. Contact any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions.

Mapper leverages machine learning to map the client’s trial balance data to PwC standard taxonomies. What can take weeks in Excel takes a matter of minutes in Mapper. Mapper leverages the Account Description, Account Type and Natural Balance from the Client’s chart of accounts to present a suggestion on the PwC standard taxonomy that best matches the account. If you previously mapped your client’s accounts to tax forms, Mapper includes a utility you can use to convert those mappings to the PwC standard taxonomy. What is Tax Adjustments? Tax Adjustments is an application that significantly streamlines the calculation of 80+ common book/tax adjustments by seamlessly integrating the exported data from Mapper. In a matter of minutes, each entity whose data is imported from Mapper will have an initial calculation of taxable income and what the tax return will look like. Users can then apply manual updates to refine taxable income as well as review and sign off on each workpaper. Tax Adjustments includes reports that allow users to review a “walk across” presentation from book balances all the way to tax form amounts. These are available for form 1120 page 1, cost of goods sold, schedule L, schedule M-1, schedule M-3 and Form 8916-A. All of these can be reviewed prior to exporting the data to your preferred tax software. If you have questions or would like more information, please contact Daniel Mason or Nicholas Dolecki.

It is a general principle that taxpayers have a right to manage their tax affairs provided they act within the law. Equally they should also be able to access independent advice on their tax position. However, the global nature of the business world together with the complexity and competing priorities of national laws, including tax competition amongst nations, is such that it is not always clear where lines should be drawn. The Global Tax Code of Conduct covers the conduct of the member firms, who they should act for, and how they should act. Read the Global Tax Code of Conduct at this link.

With Critical Audit Matter reporting on the horizon, the timing for this refresh couldn’t be better. Click here to watch a short video on the new audit committee report templates. This roll-out, part of our efforts to simplify and standardize our work and digitize our client communications, will take place in three phases: After reviewing audit committee reports across several of our PCAOB clients and talking to GEPs across all sectors, in Phase 1 we have rebranded our templates for audits conducted under PCAOB standards, expanded content to include our commitment to provide insights from the audit and trending topics, and created a best practice example for audit plan communications. The new templates include a presentation style executive summary along with summarized trending topics covering accounting and regulatory topics, corporate governance insights and select sectors. They are now available in U.S. Template Manager. We strongly encourage teams to use the new templates. Phase 2 will include rebranded templates for audits conducted under AICPA standards with best practice examples. In addition, best practice examples for quarterly reviews, interim results and completion reports for audits conducted under PCAOB standards will be available in early spring. Phase 3 will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2018 and will include tech-enabled report creation. In addition, the library of trending topics will include all sectors and LOS, consistent with our One Firm strategy. The tool will also facilitate rollforward of reports in subsequent years. We strongly encourage the use of these new templates. The feedback has been extremely positive. Some of the benefits include: Facilitate the focus by the audit committees on the most important aspects of our audit and the value we bring Easier delivery of the presentation at the audit committee meeting More consistent experience across our client base, with a branded modern look and feel Supports creation of the documents quickly and efficiently To access the new templates directly, refer to U.S. Template Manager here.

Accessing map via a browser (Chrome, Internet Explorer) is a great way to create a more seamless experience between map and other working environments including Google Apps and SharePoint. Here are some simple solutions that can help you get the most out of your map experience when working in your Internet browser. I’d like to... Solution in place Open a map file in a browser The quickest way to open map files in your browser is to open map Portfolio in your browser (pro tip: bookmark it!) and then open your map file. If you are viewing your map file in Lotus Notes, you can open the file in a browser by clicking on “Open in a Browser” under the “Information” tab. Copy emails from my PwC Google Mail account into my map file Install and use the “Gmail - Copy to map File” app from the PwC Chrome Store, which is accessible by selecting the PwC icon in the top right of your Chrome browser. You may also click on this link to launch the app directly. Copy a Google Doc/Sheet/Slide from Google Drive to my map file Open your Google Drive, then right click on the document that you would like to copy into your map file. Hover over the “Open with” and select “Copy to map file” then choose your map file. Additional tips and tricks: Deploy a map file: Click here to launch a short video on how to deploy a map file. Note: Be sure to deploy your map file from the appropriate map Portfolio: Advisory, Transaction Services, Risk Assurance, Public Sector. You should fully open the map file via a browser or Lotus Notes upon receipt of the confirmation email from TeamFind. Change your map file information: You can make updates to the file name and engagement team members under the “Activities” drop down menu on the top right corner of any map file. For other administrative updates, such as adding or changing WBS codes, click on “Open TeamFind Profile” also under “Activities.” Avoid the use of special characters in document, attachment or folder names: Issues with opening attachments or finding documents in map files have been linked to the use of special characters, such as +, %, #, and @. Using map Explorer: map Explorer lets you add, open, save and edit documents directly in your map files without needing to navigate to the specific map file first – in the same way that you would use Windows Explorer to navigate your laptop hard drives. Look for the icon below on your desktop. Note: In order to effectively use map Explorer, you need to ensure that your Lotus Notes password settings are configured correctly or you will be prompted to enter your password. Visit the Advisory R&amp;Q Roadmap: Working with a map file page for additional guidance. Wrapping up a map file: Be sure to wrap up and close your map file no later than 90 days after you complete your engagement. To wrap up the file, click on the "Wrap-up File" link in the “Activities” menu. A map wizard will launch to guide you through the process. Deleting a map file: You may need to delete a map file if your engagement never started, you accidentally created duplicate map files or you launched a map file from the wrong portfolio. To delete the map file, click "Access/File Management" and then click "Delete Database." Deletions are subject to approval by Line of Service (LOS) R&amp;Q. Note: If your engagement started but did not complete, you should wrap up the file using the “Abandoned” option for file status. Questions or more information For more detailed descriptions of these solutions, visit the map Spark page, contact your LOS R&amp;Q team or open map Help (by clicking on “Help &amp; Links” at the top right of your file page).

How do you want your new iPhone -- fancy or fancy-schmancy? PwC Technology Oct. 12, 2017 By now, you’ve probably heard all about Apple’s annual keynote and the dramatic unveiling of not one, but two shiny new iPhone models: iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Pre-order for the iPhone 8 began Friday Oct 15, and the iPhone X begins Oct. 27. If you’re going to devote your heart (and cash) to a new device, you need the facts. We hosted a Webex to answer as many questions as we could -- you can view the recording here. We’re still sorting out some complicated questions, but here’s what we know now. When should I upgrade to iOS11? OK, this isn’t your top question -- but we need to get it out of the way: Even though iOS11 was released Sept. 19, we recommend you wait 2-3 weeks to upgrade. This allows developers (including PwC) to make updates so apps work well. Watch PwC Inside -- we’ll let you know when it’s OK to update. I’m eligible for a device upgrade. How much do the various new iPhones cost? Below are the costs for those eligible for an upgrade: iPhone Model Retail Price AT&amp;T Upgrade Verizon Upgrade T-Mobile Upgrade Sprint Upgrade iPhone 8 64 GB $699 $49.99 $49.99 $49.99 Free iPhone 8 256 GB $849 $199.99 $199.99 $199.99 $100.00 iPhone 8 Plus 64 GB $799 $149.99 $149.99 $149.99 $50.00 iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB $949 $299.99 $299.99 $299.99 $200.00 iPhone X 64 GB $999 $349.99 $349.99 $349.99 $250.00 iPhone X 256 GB $1,149 $499.99 $499.99 $499.99 $400.00 This is my first device with this carrier. Do I get a price break? If this is the first smartphone on a new contract through PwC, subsidized pricing is significantly reduced from full retail price: iPhone Model Retail Price New acct - AT&amp;T New acct - Verizon New acct - T-Mobile New acct - Sprint iPhone 8 64 GB $699 Free Free Free Free iPhone 8 256 GB $849 $99.99 $99.99 $99.99 $100.00 iPhone 8 Plus 64 GB $799 $49.99 $49.99 $49.99 $50.00 iPhone 8 Plus 256 GB $949 $199.99 $199.99 $199.99 $200.00 iPhone X 64 GB $999 $249.99 $249.99 $249.99 $250.00 iPhone X 256 GB $1,149 $399.99 $399.99 $399.99 $400.00 Prices are subject to change; the eMobility Portal always has the most current pricing. I’m ready to commit! How do I pre-order that sweet, sweet iPhone 8? Access the eMobility Portal and see the Assets box. In the Upgrade Eligible/Date column, you’ll see either “Upgrade now” or your future eligibility date. (Only smartphones are eligible.) If you’re eligible, select Upgrade Now and follow the prompts (more info here if you need it). How long will it take my iPhone to arrive? Pre-order for the iPhone 8 began on Sept. 15, shipping Sept. 22. Pre-order for the iPhone X begins Oct. 27, shipping Nov. 3. Orders are processed as of the pre-order date/time, and they’re fulfilled in the order received. However, popular devices like these can take 4-8 weeks to arrive. Even if you order immediately there could be shipping delays -- it all depends on your carrier’s inventory. Watch the eMobility portal for tracking info (IT won’t have further details). Pro tips: Any billing issues will delay your order. Your personal credit card will be charged once the device is ready to ship, so be sure to use a card that won’t expire in the next few months. Make sure your billing address matches your credit card address. Gift cards cannot be used for payment. If I upgraded within the last 20 months, can I buy an iPhone 8 for PwC’s subsidized price and pay the difference? No, you only receive subsidized pricing through PwC when you’re eligible for an upgrade. You can purchase a device prior to your upgrade date, but you’d pay full retail cost. Can I line up at the Apple store and buy one? Technically, you can purchase a phone at any time. But if you purchase from Apple or another retailer, you won’t receive PwC-subsidized pricing (even if you’re eligible). Can I add an Apple Watch to my PwC plan? We’re still assessing this. We suggest waiting for now -- please see these considerations before pre-ordering. Got another question? We have a thread going on Spark -- post it there, and we’ll reply ASAP.

Beginning Monday, Oct. 23, PVs will be integrated into the current automated system with features including: Mobile-friendly design: Access the system from any PwC-managed device.

This is when we look back at how far we’ve come this year and celebrate the accomplishments that brought us here. Because our business is strong, we have confirmed an overall 10% increase in the bonus pool. And, next week, you'll receive your $1,000 Be well bonus in your pay. The purpose of the bonus pool is to provide meaningful rewards that are aligned with business performance. The 10% uplift doesn’t mean individual bonuses will necessarily increase by 10%. Of course, the most important thing is what the uplift means for your personal situation. That’s not a question we can answer yet.Just as in past years, we make bonus decisions through the CRT process so we can look at each person’s performance and impact -- and set that against the bigger picture of how the business and their peer group performed. A lot of time and care goes into this process -- and you’ll hear the results in June when Career Outlook conversations take place between June 13 and July 12. In the meantime, I hope you'll enjoy your Be well bonus. Remember to share -- either on social media using #Bewellworkwell or via email -- how you plan to spend your bonus to boost one of the four dimensions of energy, so that it may inspire others. It’s been a lot of fun to hear your plans for the bonus. Whatever you choose, we hope you’ll invest in yourself, just as we are investing in you!

The IRS opened the preparer tax identification number (PTIN) system for 2019 renewals Monday, October 22nd. It is our understanding the IRS sent out renewal notices to all PTIN holders indicating that the 2019 PTIN renewal period is now underway. All tax professionals should have also received notification from the firm of a My Compliance Dashboard entry regarding their 2019 PTIN requirement on October 23, 2018. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN and updating your status in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database, you will be required to complete your My Compliance Dashboard PTIN requirement by the due date. As a reminder, the PTIN requirement is a three-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or approved exemption) in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database Complete your PTIN Confirmation requirement on your Compliance Dashboard The PTIN Requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2018 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2018 PTIN before you can renew for 2019. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2018 calendar year. The firm requires all personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must create an entry in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit. NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update your status in the database accordingly. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202)346-5219 or Mike McDermott at (949)437-5413.

What you should do Access to client and firm confidential information should be limited to only those individuals that have a "need to know". The risk to the firm and our people is real and we count on your vigilance to help mitigate those risks by: • Discussing individual data access needs and data collection procedures during engagement kickoff meetings or at the beginning of engagement performance. Grant access on a "need to know" basis only. • Specifying with the client the data elements needed for the work to be performed and collect only the minimum information necessary. • Establishing data collection procedures and agree on the encryption method to be used – be sensitive to data when it travels. • Reviewing the data when received and return or request the removal of extraneous data. • Securing information when not actively in use (i.e., at the end of the day or while in transit) – e.g., keep hard copies in locked cabinets or locked firm issued devices. Non-public information should not be shared Keep in mind that disclosing or discussing confidential client information or firm private matters with friends, family, or coworkers (without a need to know) whether in person or through forms such as blogs, discussion groups, external or instant messaging services or social media sites can provide clues to non-public information that may harm both the firm and you. Questions? Contact a member of the Tax Q&amp;RM team or visit the Q&amp;RM Home page on Tax Source for additional information on Tax Data Security, Confidentiality and Your Responsibility. If you become aware of or suspect a situation where information has or could become lost, please immediately report it to the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS).

Their advice was, “Make sure everyone knows why this matters to us and our careers.” The bottom line is our strategy and the strength of our business matter to all of us — from the opportunities we have, to our ability to reward you for your contributions. Our business is strong — and that’s a good place to be. That means we have the financial capacity to reward your good work and invest in our firm’s future through Your Tomorrow. We had a good year in FY18, and that trend continues in FY19. Firmwide revenues of $3.6 billion are slightly ahead of budget, and profitability is tracking well for the first quarter. We have a plan for FY19. This year we’re going to turn up the dial on Your Tomorrow and execute on our goal to make PwC a truly digital organization. We're changing our firm to serve our clients even better and to secure our future. Nearly every type of business is going digital. That means that as we lean in and learn how to use technology to work differently, we put ourselves in position to be in demand for the long term (just like our firm). Read my FY19 strategy letter. This is a look at our progress and what we want to accomplish — and why digitizing our business will help us provide an even better experience for our clients and all of you. Be part of our next firmwide Town Hall webcast, Oct. 30 at 4:30 p.m. ET. We’ll talk about what’s next for Your Tomorrow, and have some fun, too! (You’ll receive a calendar invite to hold the time on your schedule.) When our business does well, we have the ability to reward you. One of the outcomes of delivering Your Tomorrow — and continuing to focus on One Firm teamwork and running our business well — is we expect to have another strong year. The updates today from Maria, Roy, Mohamedand Jim include Q1 business results and the bonus ranges for our FY19 performance bonus plan. We’re in this together, so we all need to know the plan.

The Q&amp;RM self-study series is required for Associates, Senior Associates and Managers and should be completed the earlier of 12 months of the courses being posted to your Vantage Need to Do Tile or promotion to the next staff class. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the Q&amp;RM expectation is for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility. Completion requirements: Q&amp;RM series training should be completed within the timeframe specified. Promotions to the next staff level carry a Q&amp;RM training completion requirement in FY18, similar to the annual CPE requirement. The required courses for your staff level can be accessed in Vantage: Manager Courses: 1 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 1 - Targeting a Client. 2 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 2 - Engaging the Client. 3 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 3 - Analyzing Independence. 4 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 4 - Negotiating the Contract. 5 - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Manager 5 - Performing the Engagement. * - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Documentation Training * - US Tax Q&amp;RM: Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR).

Flight delayed? Use the time to earn CPEs Meeting canceled? Flight delayed? Use the time to earn CPEs Ethics &amp; Compliance Oct. 18, 2018 When you unexpectedly find time in your day, take the opportunity to learn something new and earn CPE credits. The deadline to meet firm CPE requirements is June 30, and taking advantage of downtime now will help you avoid the last-minute rush to be in compliance with this critical professional requirement. You’ll also be able to put what you learned into practice sooner with your clients and make an even greater impact. Here are some tips: Check credits needed: Access your Learner Compliance Summary in Vantage. Where your report shows “PwC US Firm CPE Policy,” click “View compliance report” and check the “Credits Needed” column to see how many CPEs you need to earn. This Quick Reference Card explains how. Make a plan: Use the LoS learning resources in Vantage to map out your plan for earning CPEs. Click on the “Need CPE” tile to search for content that makes the most sense for your development. And now your search is even easier -- just sort and filter. Add to calendar: To stay on track, add one or more of these reminders to your Google calendar for the last week of March, April and May. (For Lotus Notes, manually copy and paste this information into your calendar.) Submit external courses for credit: You may want to see if you can get CPE credit for external courses or conferences you’ve attended. Here’s how. Are you exempt? CPE requirements apply to almost all partners and client service staff -- both CPAs and non-CPAs. But if you believe you should be exempt from the firm’s CPE requirements, reach out now to the CPE Compliance team. Need help? Follow CPE Compliance on Spark to learn more about your CPE requirements, including how the 120-hour rolling requirement works and how we determine if you are subject to the audit/attest CPE policy. If you have any questions about your CPE responsibilities, please email us at CPE.Compliance@us.pwc.com.

Phishing, cyberthreats and malicious links, oh my! Network Information Security Oct. 31, 2017 October is just about over, and we’ve been talking a lot about continuous improvement in keeping PwC’s information safe. So what’s next? How can you continue to boost your security awareness so you can help protect the firm, our clients, and your own personal data? First, let’s recap the key security tips we’ve explored this month -- and how you can make a difference: Make sure the websites you visit are secure and legitimate (full article). Don’t click on suspicious links or attachments, and report them right away to us.phish.reporting@pwc.com (full article). Use the Information Protection Principles and Engagement Lifecycle Checklist to help strengthen your digital acumen and guide you when collecting, transferring or exchanging data (full article). Follow the Secure Workspace Policy so you can protect confidential firm and client information wherever you work -- in the office or remotely (full article). Our phishing IQ doubled! We run continuous tests to help the firm improve on our ability to recognize phishing emails -- the No. 1 way cybercriminals try to infiltrate organizations like PwC. Our latest phishing simulation was an email about an invoice ready for signature. Remember that one? Only 15% of you clicked on the “malicious” link in the email, compared to over 30% in the last phishing simulation of a similar nature. That’s a 50% drop! On top of that, more than 4,000 staff reported the email to us.phish.reporting@pwc.com for a chance to win our Phish Reporting Challenge. Great job. Even with the most sophisticated spam filters, real phishing attacks still get through to employee inboxes. It just takes one person clicking on a malicious link or file attachment in an email to spread malware -- such as ransomware or spyware -- across the entire network! To learn more, watch these quick videos on how phishing works and how it can affect the firm. How can you learn more?

In a recent phishing drill, fewer than 1% of PwCers clicked on a suspicious link in an “Account security alert” email. And only a fraction shared credentials on the linked webpage. So hats off to you! But we still need to keep our guard up. That’s why we run periodic phishing simulations -- to foster a security-conscious culture and raise awareness of real phishing schemes. Report that phish! Spotting a phish is important, but it’s imperative that you also report potential attacks. Based on our tests, only 1 in 10 partners and staff report potential phishing attacks. When you report a suspicious email to GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com, our team can investigate right away and -- if it’s a real attack -- protect other inboxes across our network. Winner winner, phish dinner Remember: When you report a suspicious email, you’re automatically entered into our Phish Reporting Challenge to win a $100 Amazon gift card. To report, simply email GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com (see contest rules). To see the common signs of phishing, check out this quick reference card.

For the fourth quarter, we’ll continue with our re-prioritized scheduled learning opportunities that support digital training through Your Tomorrow and supplement them with additional learning opportunities. Our main priorities are for remaining Advisory Staff to complete the Digital Academy training as soon as possible, for all staff to complete the four Digital Quests and encourage those that can to attend BXT training. Here are more details for all partners and staff: Digital Academy If you are below partner and have not yet attended, sign up for the Digital Academy! Our goal in Advisory was to have everyone below partner level attend a session by March 31. We made great progress and now want the rest of Advisory staff to get this completed as soon as possible. Remember that if you’re unable to attend the Digital Academy in your home market due to business travel, you can sign up for a session in your client location. It is extremely important to complete the pre-work PRIOR to attending your Digital Academy session. Plan for 45 minutes to install software and download data sets. (See your pre-work email for more information.) Digital Quests Complete the four Digital Quests, our industry-based online learning simulations designed to check your digital awareness. Remember, we must all complete the four Digital Quests before June 30 to earn a Digital Acumen knowledge badge. And remember, for our firm-wide Learn2earn challenge, those who complete the four Digital Quests and earn a minimum of 150 points in Digital Lab by April 30 will have the chance to earn $1,000 in Real-time recognition — one in seven will win! You can access the Digital Quests in the Digital Hub — available on PC or mobile via the Digital Hub app in PwC’s App Store. BXT Training We are encouraging everyone who is able to attend BXT Immersion or Incubator sessions during the fourth quarter. If you are interested in attending a BXT training, and you have not received an invite for a session in your market (these are sent about a month in advance of the session), please contactBXT.team@pwc.com. Here is the current schedule: BXT Immersions BXT Incubators Want to change the way we work with clients? Bring your ideas and use BXT to test and prototype over the course of 6 hours. March 29 - NYC Half day session to apply BXT to client opportunities and engagement in your home and client market April 5 - SF / Bay area April 12 - Boston May 3 - Chicago April 12 - Minneapolis April 19 - Detroit June 14 - Wash DC April 26 - Philadelphia July 12 - NYC May 17 - Boston June 7 - Chicago Integrated Solutions: What do you know about our Integrated Solutions? All Advisory partners and staff should complete the overview self-study, “Integrated Solutions: Working Together to Sell Bigger, Deliver Better.” Check out the Integrated Solutions Learning Hub where you can discover more! Also: See the list of upcoming Advisory learning opportunities for April through mid-May. Associates and managers: Take a look at our recently-added x-Advisory Development Hub for Associates and x-Advisory Development Hub for Managers. The manager hub was developed to help structure and guide current managers’ professional development activities while preparing them to become stronger candidates for director. It’s especially helpful for experienced hires who recently joined PwC. Additional hubs for senior associates and directors will launch later this year. Don’t miss out on enrollment for in-person courses. Take note of the start date. Consider ways to Reinvest in the firm. For example, participate as an instructor in future courses. For more information, see the L&amp;D for Advisory Reinvest Self-Nomination tool. Explore Vantage to identify and register for other development opportunities. You can also use Vantage to find short, informative content to get quick knowledge on topics important to clients.

You want to be able to read things quickly while you’re on the go, and access the details later if you need more information. In the spirit of the 25% Challenge, we can all do less and accomplish more with a few rules of the road for communicating within PwC: Aim to keep email text to 1,000 characters or fewer, and include a link to access all the gory details (e.g., link to a Google doc or Spark page). Don’t bury the lead. Within 30 seconds of reading, the reader should know why you’ve emailed. No “me too” emails repeating what someone else already has communicated to the same group of people. (As a reader, pay attention and don’t expect to receive multiple reminders, as you have in the past.) Think twice before you “reply to all” -- does everyone really need to receive your email? Respectfully challenge one another when receiving communications that don’t seem consistent with our guidelines. Click here for more guidance. By sticking to even these few rules of the road, together we can make a difference for one another! Questions or comments?

Desktop. App. Three words: Chat. Desktop. App. PwC Technology Nov. 5, 2018 The Google Chat desktop app is ready for action (we can hear your squeals of excitement)! It will be pushed to your PC on Friday. At the same time, we’ll delete classic Hangouts from your PC. Still want classic Hangouts? Visit chrome://extensions to download it again -- but remember, you won’t see group conversations between platforms. Chances are, classic Hangouts may go away someday soon, so why not make the switch? Not just for desktop -- PwC’s App Store has the Chat mobile app The Hangouts Chat mobile app has more to offer than the classic Hangouts app. Download Hangouts Chat from PwC’s App Store today and start taking advantage of its superior mobile experience, such as mobile access to Chat Rooms. Speaking of which … Tidy up your “Room” with Google Chat threads A key feature of Google Chat Rooms is the six-month chat history — your team can track important conversations and decisions. But a clean room takes a bit of organization, as discussions move from one topic to another (and then another, and then back to the first). ' However, Chat has a solution! Conversation threads help you ... Track dialogue surrounding decisions and updates. Find what you’re looking for (without all the digging). Get up to speed without being distracted by side conversations. To create a new thread, click the + in the bottom of the Room, and then choose a title. Pro tip: Create subject headers for threads by adding asterisks around the subject line — example: *Agenda for Wednesday call*. You can even use emoji to differentiate your Rooms. Respond by clicking Reply at the end of the thread. To unfollow a thread, click the bell icon in the upper-right corner. Here’s what it looks like in action. Chrome extensions: So long to eight of ’em Chrome extensions take up space and resources on your PC, so we periodically simplify. We’ll remove the following outdated extensions on Nov. 9 (if needed, reinstall from chrome://extensions): Mail Checker and Calendar Checker Keep (removing icon in button bar only) Google Tasks (removing icon in button bar only) Gmail Offline (now built into Mail) Drive (removing icon in button bar only) Restore Deleted Invites Tool WarnSharableLink Want more tips and IT news?

Engagement teams should normally begin the client acceptance process well before the first engagement is won for a prospective client. Not only will this allow for the completion of the client acceptance process before an engagement acceptance decision is required, but completing the process early in the pursuit process will avoid an investment of time in a prospective client that does not meet our client acceptance standards. In certain limited circumstances, engagement teams may need to begin work on an engagement before the client acceptance process is fully completed. In such situations, it may be appropriate for the engagement team to request an accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance exception via the GFS Risk Management Exception process (“conditional request”). Once obtained, an approved conditional request enables the engagement team to issue an engagement letter and obtain a charge code prior to the completion of full client acceptance. An approved conditional request does not replace or serve as a substitute for the firm's full client acceptance process. Accordingly, the conditional request process is used only in specific, limited circumstances. Moreover, even where conditional request is provided, the engagement team must complete the full client acceptance process immediately following receipt of a conditional request. &gt;&gt;&gt; The current client acceptance process, in which Salesforce is the system of record for client acceptance status rather than the A&amp;C system, can take as little as three days when no adverse data is found. Teams should submit an ADS request as soon as a prospective client is created in Salesforce. In most cases, the prospective client will be accepted in Salesforce by the time the entity is validated and added to the A&amp;C system. &lt;&lt;&lt; An accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance can be obtained by submitting a conditional request for a "New Client Entity" (not a "New Engagement/WBS Code") through the GFS Risk Management Exception Code Release Database (click here). A link to the database can also be found in the Quick Links on the Acceptance and Continuance Homepage. Conditional requests will be considered only when the following criteria are met: · The engagement team establishes that it needs to start work immediately due to a time-sensitive opportunity (i.e., the engagement team has won the work and confirmed the deliverable deadline, which does not allow sufficient time for the completion of the standard client acceptance process); · As a result of due diligence conducted by the engagement team, the engagement partner is confident that the results of the ADS performed under the full client acceptance process will not raise any reputational, financial or other concerns that would cause us to decline working for the prospective client; and · The engagement team created the Client and submitted an opportunity in Salesforce and submitted an ADS request. The ADS request should include the appropriate members of prospective client’s management, board members and/or investors/shareholders (e.g., CEO, President, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, VP of Tax/ Director, Chairman of the Board, Audit Committee Chair and/or key investors/shareholders). It is important that the engagement partner be involved in the entire client acceptance process, including the conditional request process. The firm's client acceptance process is a fundamental firm policy and risk management control. The engagement partner is responsible for the proper consideration of all risk management policies and procedures on their engagements. The GFS Exception does not replace the Adverse Data Search and A&amp;C client acceptance assessment process, if required. In general, client acceptance in A&amp;C is required for new, non-audit clients of the US/Mexico firm (generally at the Ultimate Domestic Parent entity level) when: · Adverse data has been identified by the ADS team and you have been instructed to complete a client acceptance assessment in A&amp;C · The prospective client is a foreign entity with no US or Mexico operations (regardless of ADS finding · Your team feels that input from Risk Management or Business Leadership is required to evaluate this new client (regardless of ADS findings) Full client acceptance must be complete in accordance with the instructions provided by the ADS team as soon as possible, and in no event, later than within six weeks of obtaining an approved conditional request. Teams need to perform due diligence and submit supplemental information along with a conditional request to facilitate the expedited, conditional client acceptance evaluation process, which includes responding to the questions listed below. When gathering supplemental information, do not solely rely on the prospective client’s website but rather perform due diligence using resources such as Factiva Google, Google News, Bloomberg, and other reputable tools and share the sources used. The supplemental information includes the following: · Identify the prospective client and briefly describe the related ownership/organizational structure and its business. · Describe the nature and scope of the services to be performed. · Briefly describe PwC's relationships (e.g., lead tax partners, other relevant relationships) with the potential new client, if any. · If the client is referred to us from another PwC member firm, obtain a copy of that member firm's client acceptance or similar information that would be helpful in making the US firm's assessment (e.g., is the prospective client an accepted Assurance, Tax and/or Advisory client of the member firm, how recent was the client acceptance completed by the member firm). · In the event our relationship with the prospective client is limited, perform due diligence on the company, its executives/significant shareholders, directors or the individual client, as appropriate, and provide a copy of the information obtained and the sources from which it was obtained. · Provide list of client’s board members/senior management and link to relevant information regarding such persons. · Identify potential risk factors/basis for your assessment of potential risk factors (e.g., litigation with other service providers, vendors/clients, employees/board members, financing concerns). · Identify potential conflicts of interest. · Document the engagement partner's conclusion as to whether the client should be conditionally accepted as a client, and why. · Identify any reasons to question the integrity of the prospective client, subsidiaries, management team, and shareholders/owners and/or partners. · Provide potential client website link. · Confirm that an ADS has been requested. Important reminders: An approved conditional request DOES NOT replace a Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment requirement. A Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment must be completed in the A&amp;C system for each and every engagement. Resource: Click here to see the "New Client Acceptance Reference Guide - Salesforce".

Certain Google Drive files will be deleted on April 8 — rev Important! Certain Google Drive files will be deleted on April 8 — review now PwC Technology April 4, 2019 As part of a targeted data cleanup effort related to sensitive cybersecurity client projects, all Google Drive files that were shared with you and owned by a specific subset of certain former partners and staff will be deleted after Monday, April 8, 2019. You may unknowingly need files owned by one of these former partners and staff members, and we’ve provided a way for you to review and save those files from deletion. Please note that once the Google Drive files are deleted, there will be no way to recover them. To determine if you or your team need any files that are part of this Google Drive cleanup: Open these specially configured links: My Drive and Shared with me. If, like the vast majority of our partners and staff, you don’t see any files, no further action is required. You are done. If you see one or more files listed but you don’t need them, no action is required. You are done. If you see a file you need and it relates to a cybersecurity engagement that was in process at any time during the period of March 1, 2013 through Feb, 29, 2016, contact US_Cyber_EPD_Help@pwc.com for a consultation. No files subject to OGC Legal Hold are in-scope for deletion. If you see a file you need that doesn’t meet that criterion, make a copy to retain the file before the original is deleted on April 8. Follow these detailed steps for more guidance. You’ll also see a popup prior to the deadline to remind you to review files before they are deleted. If you have questions, contact US_Cyber_EPD_Help@pwc.com. Please do not contact PwC Help or IT Customer Support.

Starting this year, the minimum must be achieved for the performance year in order to be eligible to earn a Tier 1 or 2 annual performance bonus. The minimum will vary by Vertical based on the nature of the work and types of engagements we’re delivering and has been or will be communicated by your Vertical leadership. Your utilization is important because it’s directly correlated to the time you spend working with our clients, which drives your professional development and also has a direct impact on our profitability. During our last Advisory Q&amp;A Webcast, we heard your questions about how to do all the things you want to fit into the year, including Reinvesting in the firm and taking vacation, and still meet your Client Utilization minimum. Watch these two videos for a breakdown on how utilization is calculated and for advice on how to manage your time from the perspective of two of your colleagues! Associate and Senior Associates Watch Elizabeth Carlson, an HIA Senior Associate, speak about how to balance reinvesting in the firm with client time. She discusses the importance of setting performance and personal goals up front and following through with them.

Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. Q&amp;RM’s Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a privacy notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period provides any tax service to a person in a financial reporting oversight role at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a financial reporting oversight role (FROR) in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)). Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Section 7216 consent must be obtained for all tax compliance and consulting engagements for individuals due to the nature of our business operations (e.g., use of GDM resources, third party contractors, back office support, etc.) and if the client requests that we disclose the client's tax return information to their representatives or professional advisors (e.g., the client's legal counsel, secretary, head (or CFO) of family office, etc.). This consent must be obtained prior to disclosing information to third parties. The consent must be signed by the client. Please note that the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information must be obtained annually, including in the case of a multi-year contract. Privacy Policy Notice Tax LOS policy requires that privacy notices be sent to clients when providing individual tax (compliance and consulting) services. The GLBA Privacy Notice must be provided when the client relationship commences. For existing clients, an annual notice must be provided every calendar year. Engagement teams should be sure to use the most current engagement letter templates from the Engagement Letters Index.

Complying with these laws is important since we have and pursue state and local government contracts, and in certain situations, contributions can actually impact our ability to undertake these engagements. In some instances, the "pay-to-play" laws may restrict or prohibit political contributions from Partners to state and local candidates and political committees. In other instances, the "pay-to-play" laws allow contributions, but require the firm to disclose the amounts and recipients. Depending on the jurisdiction, these laws may also apply to a Partner’s spouse, domestic partner and any dependent children To assure our continued compliance with these “pay-to-play” laws, before you, your spouse/domestic partner or dependent children make a campaign contribution to a candidate for state or local office, or to the candidate's political campaign committee, please contact Carole Yanofsky, Government Ethics &amp; Compliance Leader, (see GOVEC Org Chart), or a member of the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) team responsible for Tax risk issues.

Flex + TalentLink automation is here…sweet! Advisory - test Feb. 5, 2019 As we know, FlexForecast (Flex) and TalentLink have been a thing for quite some time now. And as we approach Valentine’s Day, this pairing is better than ever! A few new enhancements are available to help us manage our engagement financials and resource planning with a little less legwork and a lot more automation. By building out your budgets in Flex early on in the process, the automated integration with TalentLink means: You can secure the appropriate available resources for your projects via a single point of entry in Flex - demand and supply are connected more via automation. Deployment has the necessary time to staff TBDs with the right competencies/skills without multiple emails/phone calls, which is all documented in Flex. You have the most accurate picture of your engagement’s economics. All of these things also mean that our partners and leadership can better connect demand with supply and have a more accurate forecast of our business. Sounds great, right? So, here are the enhancements to Flex that make this “thing” so powerful: Flex Enhancement Enhancement Description Enhanced TBD Fields Captures critical additional information about the staff you need, such as, role description, travel restrictions, skills needed, etc. Project/Resource Indicators Offers a direct link to resources’ TalentLink schedules Incorporates an over-capacity indicator to indicate if resources are over-scheduled Automation Automated overnight feed from Flex to TalentLink allows for next-day insight into resource data. So, what does this mean for how we work with deployment? Starting a New Budget in Flex Identify Need: Rather than contacting our deployers to initiate a new staffing need, enter resource needs directly in Flex, including TBD resources. Be sure to click “Send to Deployment” in Flex once a need is more than 80% likely to sell (i.e., do not wait until we receive a signed engagement letter). Confirm Resources: Our deployers will continue to work together with our engagement teams to facilitate TBD staffing options. After identifying resources, go back into Flex to update the budget from TBD to the staff name. Deployment will not make this update in Flex. In Progress Engagements Make Changes: For in-flight projects, engagement teams must update the Flex estimate-to-complete (ETC) with all schedule/booking updates, which will automatically notify deployers and update TalentLink. Therefore, it is important to actively monitor ETCs at least monthly. Staff Booking Updates: Going forward, please note the following procedure to update staff bookings a. Chargeable Updates: Notify deployer via a Flex ETC update b. Non-Chargeable Updates: Continue to send to deployers via the TalentLink Booking Request Google form If you’d like to access more Flex and TalentLink resources - including FAQs, quick reference cards and videos - please visit our Spark page. And remember, don’t hesitate to reach out to your vertical Finance team with any other Flex questions.

That sinking feeling when you see a typo a split-second after you click “Send.” But with Google Mail, you can retract that email for up to 30 seconds after sending. Save yourself the embarrassment of errors and accidents by enabling Undo Send. Turn on the Undo Send feature in Google Mail: In the upper-right corner of Google Mail, click and select Settings. In the "Undo Send" section, check the box next to Enable Undo Send. In the Send cancellation period section, set the window of time during which you can retract an email. Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes. Now each time you send an email, you'll see "Your message has been sent," plus options to Undo or View message. Click Undo, and you can edit and resend (or delete) your message. That’s it! If only all mistakes were this easy to undo. Want more tips and IT news?

Players from all levels and lines of service participated in the annual competition in which friends, teammates, colleagues and alumni displayed the firm’s value of working together as they compete for the first place trophies. This year, the Tampa team won the Men’s Division, while the DC Metro team, a combination of Tampa and DC colleagues, won its third Women’s Division title in a row. Carlo Bruno, a director and Tampa shortstop, commented on what the tournament meant to him and his team: “We were all excited and honored to represent the Southeast Market with a win in the 33rd annual tournament. After a wild week leading up to the tournament -- with the hurricane and all that came with it -- the tournament was a great way to connect and have a lot of fun with old and new teammates, colleagues, alumni and friends." Jennifer Blevins, a Tampa manager who plays first base for the DC Metro team, said, “We look forward to playing in this tournament every year. Our team has developed some amazing friendships from participating in this event. It gives us the opportunity to reconnect and have a lot of fun away from the office. We were so excited to win another championship, and we look forward to defending it next year!" Want to join in the fun? The annual tournament is held the third weekend of September.

Starting today, you can see for yourself. Here’s what you need to know: Connect Audit Manager and companion tools Starting today, you can manage many aspects of your multi-location audit workflow in one place - limiting the volume of email exchanges. Our new global collaboration tool for group and component teams, including shared service and statutory teams, simplifies and streamlines interoffice coordination and communications by enhancing workflow management, streamlining real-time communication, and providing enhanced status tracking and monitoring of deliverables. Here’s how to get started: Gain an understanding of the following companion tools, which are also now live: Client Base - provides a central place for entering data points for a new Connect Audit Manager site. If you haven’t already, set up your Client Base template (and remember that the SDC can assist with the set-up and administration of Client Base and Connect Audit Manager). Client Base is required to be set up before using Connect Audit Manager. Connect Instructions Tool - assists in creating group instructions for PwC component teams through the completion of a series of questions and prompts. Your responses drive the creation of interoffice instructions and appendices that are in accordance with the applicable auditing standards (ISA, PCAOB and AICPA) and PwC audit policies (Global and US). Be sure to contact your component teams if you plan to use Connect Audit Manager in 2018. Reference materials are available on the Spark site to start this conversation. Refer to Alert 18/34 for instructions on updating certain multi-location EGAs when the use of Connect Audit Manager and/or the Connect Instructions Tool is planned. Learn more and access the tool at the Connect Audit Manager Spark site. For questions regarding Connect Audit Manager and companion tools, contact your US Connect Audit Manager team. Connect v3 The new version of Connect includes faster document upload and download speeds, greater visibility across your portfolio with a new cross-site dashboard and on-time statistics, and Aura integration. Here’s what you should consider as you plan to use Connect v3: Connect v3 is a separate website from the current version of Connect (v2.7). Existing Connect sites will not be automatically upgraded to Connect v3. You can use your existing Connect site until you and your client are ready to use Connect v3. We recommend you transition to Connect v3 as soon as practicable. For calendar year public engagements, this will likely be either before or after the Q2 review is completed. All calendar year-end audits are encouraged to use Connect v3 for year-end requests. To transition to Connect v3, leverage the materials available on Spark, including the information on how the SDC can assist, how to explain the change to your client, and how to use the new features. Refer to Alert 18/34 for instructions on updating relevant Aura EGAs in your engagement files. For questions regarding Connect, contact your US Connect team.

The IRS will open the preparer tax identification number (PTIN) system for 2019 renewals Monday, Oct. 22. It is our understanding the IRS will be sending out renewal notices to all PTIN holders within the next week or so indicating that the 2019 PTIN renewal period is now underway. All tax professionals will also be receiving notification from the firm of a My Compliance Dashboard entry regarding their 2019 PTIN requirement on Oct. 23, 2018. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN and updating your status in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database, you will be required to complete your My Compliance Dashboard PTIN requirement by the due date. As a reminder, the PTIN requirement is a three-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or approved exemption) in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database Complete your PTIN Confirmation requirement on your Compliance Dashboard The PTIN Requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2018 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2018 PTIN before you can renew for 2019. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2018 calendar year. The firm requires all personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must create an entry in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit (link). NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption in the Tax LOS PTIN Reporting database. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update your status in the database accordingly. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202)346-5219 or Mike McDermott at (949)437-5413.

A few caveats. Please don’t photograph anything confidential or containing client or firm information (whiteboards with client names, laptop screens, client locations).

Such engagements include the following: Tax provision preparation or review Accounting for uncertain tax positions Tax accounting performance improvement GHRS Pension/OPEB valuation, stock-based compensation accounting or deferred tax related services (ASC 712, 715, 718 and/or 740). Because of the risk profile of such engagements, tax engagement teams should be aware of the risk management protocols available to help teams mitigate the risks on these engagements. One such protocol requires that all tax accounting service engagements for non-audit clients be approved by a TAS Market Leader or a GHRS Accounting Services Leader. In addition, tax accounting service engagements that have been designated as high risk require Tax Q&amp;RM approval and the approval and active involvement of a Concurring Partner (“CP”) with tax accounting experience. All approvals should be obtained during the engagement acceptance process and prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. Engagement teams should select the characteristics that apply to the engagement when completing the A&amp;C engagement acceptance assessment to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained during the Engagement Acceptance process. When providing tax accounting services for non-audit clients, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check CES restriction to determine if client is a non-audit client If a non-audit client, initiate the engagement acceptance assessment Obtain TAS/GHRS leader approval and, if applicable, Tax Q&amp;RM and CP approvals Execute engagement contract Begin work For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that a different approval process applies to engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients.

Are you on the path to promotion this year? HQ News March 2, 2017 Team, We care deeply about being a firm where the most talented people of all backgrounds come to reach for their potential. This is not new for us, but we’re always looking for ways to get better. Preparing you to lead at the next level Earlier this year we introduced Blindspots training, based on leading research by Dr. Mahzarin Banaji of Harvard University. This training is about understanding unconscious assumptions that can potentially shape our perceptions, decisions and behavior – and our ability to be effective leaders. As a result, we’re now making our Blindspots training curriculum part of the path to promotion. This means that everyone who is promoted going forward will be required to demonstrate that they have viewed the 4REAL video series as a condition of promotion. We’re not just asking everyone to watch the videos but to make the insights part of our everyday behavior and how we lead. As we advance in our careers and lead and coach others, it becomes even more important to raise our awareness level. Being an effective leader and building strong client relationships starts with earning the trust of those around you. In fact, we’re so serious about developing inclusive leaders that we’ll be requiring all our new hires to take this training, and we’re developing a version of the training to share with students on campus and others. We don’t know of any other organization taking these steps and it’s something we can be proud to share with others. Opening up opportunities for yourself and others Team, we’re a diverse group of professionals who are connected by a shared set of values. I hope everyone will take the training – even if this isn’t a promotion year for you – because our individual actions add up to a stronger culture of inclusion. Offering this training to everyone is another way we make it clear that we are committed to cultivating an inclusive environment. At the end of the day, what most of us want is the chance to be part of great teams and to do work that matters. That starts with knowing yourself and being the best leader you can be.

The wait for Team Drive is over. And it's a game changer High five! The wait for Team Drive is over. And it's a game changer PwC Technology March 24, 2018 Start collaborating in all new ways with Google Team Drives. These shared drives let your team store stuff in a central location -- where all members have access to all of the files, all of the time. When collaborating with Team Drives, teammates can be up-to-date and share a consistent view of content. But wait, there’s more: Onboard new teammates with ease. Every person (and Google Group!) added to a Team Drive gets instant access to all team documents. Cut back on granting file access. All members within Team Drives automatically see the same files regardless of who adds or reorganizes them. Forget about hunting for documents. With team ownership, individual members can’t accidentally remove or delete files that others need. And if a team member leaves the project (or the firm), files remain in the Team Drive. Manage permissions in a snap. Team Drives allow you to specialize permissions based on who needs to edit, comment, organize or delete certain files. Learn more with FAQs Get started To create a Team Drive, complete this form. Your Team Drive will be created automatically, and you’ll receive a link via email. Requestors will have full access to add additional members and Google groups. The fine print Global Business Rules: Be sure to follow these rules before setting up your Team Drives. File transfers: If you are the owner of a file in your personal Google Drive (“My Drive”), you can move it to a Team Drive. But if you want to move an entire folder from Google Drive to a Team Drive, you’ll need to contact US IT Customer Support. Aura: To transfer Google files from a Team Drive to the Aura Document Library, first move the file(s) to your personal Drive.

In order to comply with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) issued by the European Parliament and Council, all lines of service are modifying their respective A&amp;C assessment to include a new set of questions related to GDPR. In the Tax A&amp;C, these questions will be found in Section 8 of the assessment. Each assessment will begin with 3 questions that deal with collection of personal data (how and from whom). Certain answers will trigger additional questions, and certain engagements will require a consultation with the Privacy Office. In addition to the GDPR questions, the A&amp;C questions for PwC Mexico Tax will now be incorporated directly into the assessment. With the exception of anti-money laundering questions, all PwC Mexico Tax questions will be included in Section 1 of the assessment. Also, to provide consistency within the Firm, the assessment for PwC Mexico Tax will now only be available in English. Questions? If you have questions specific to the Tax A&amp;C assessment, please reach out to Adam Noia. If you have questions specific to the new data protection section, reach out to Wendy Samuels or email the Privacy Office (privacy.office@us.pwc.com) for a consultation.

Advisory - test May 18, 2017 New deployment types are being launched on June 2 in the US Advisory (non-PS) and Cyber map Portfolios. Make sure to choose the correct type when deploying your next map file: US-led engagement: use this deployment type for Advisory engagements (other than Public Sector or Fit for Growth) led by a US Engagement Leader MX-led engagement: use this deployment type for Advisory engagements led by a Mexico Engagement Leader US Fit For Growth engagements: All US Fit For Growth engagements must select this map deployment type. This should only be used for US FFG engagements. Cyber Security Services map Environment map files for all new engagements where we will be providing Cyber Security services should be launched within the dedicated Cyber Services map environment. If you are unsure whether or not your engagement or a piece of your engagement falls into this category, please refer to the FY17 Cybersecurity, Privacy &amp; Risk Product Code Guide. To launch map files within this dedicated environment, you will need to access the CYBER map Portfolio tool in Lotus Notes. A link is also available on the Advisory R&amp;Q microsite. A Few map File Leading Practices Leverage the Gmail and Google Drive Integration Apps. The 'Gmail-Copy to map file' tool, located in your Chrome PwC Actions menu, allows you to copy Google emails to your map file (just as you can do in Notes). The Google Drive 'Copy to map file' tool allows you to copy your Google Drive files into your map file. Read more about these tools. Periodically confirm who has access to your map File. Consistent with firm policy, access to map files must be restricted to appropriate users who have an active role in the engagement and / or have a legitimate business need to know. Access to map files should be regularly reviewed and users who no longer meet these criteria should be promptly removed from the access list. Wrap up map Files for completed engagements. As per Risk Management Policy, map files must be closed no later than 90 days after you complete your engagement. To close the file, click on the "Wrap-up File" link in the “Activities” menu. A map wizard will launch to guide you through the process. Want more map Tips and Tricks?

Your 401(k) contribution rate will apply to both your bonus payment and semi-monthly pay at the end of September. If you're eligible for a bonus, note the following deadlines. Sept. 15 - If you want to increase or decrease your 401(k) Savings Plan contribution percentage rate, make an election at Benefits Express prior to 4 p.m. ET on Sept. 15. Any changes made by that time will affect your Sept. 28 payroll deduction (which includes your bonus payment). Sept. 30 - If you make a change in light of the bonus payment but want to resume your original contribution rate for your Oct. 15 pay, you must make another contribution rate change at Benefits Express between Sept. 16 and Sept. 30 at 4 p.m. ET. If you don’t make a change by Sept. 15 at 4 p.m. ET, your current contribution election will apply to any Sept. bonus payment as well as all semi-monthly paychecks until you change your election in the future. 401(k) Savings Plan contribution limits The IRS limits 401(k) plan pre-tax contributions to $18,500 in 2018 ($24,500 if you will be age 50 by Dec. 31). You can find out how much you’ve contributed to the 401(k) Savings Plan this year by accessing the Financial Well-Being module on myKcurve or reviewing your pay advice. You can also view your calendar year-to-date 401(k) Savings Plan contributions as well as update your contribution election from your iPhone or iPad using the Me@PwC app, which you can find in PwC’s App Store. Note: The Me@PwC app is for US staff only. This app is not available to partners and US staff on international assignment. Don’t lose out on firm-matching contributions Remember, the firm matches 25% of the first 6% of pay you contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan each pay period on either a pre-tax or post-tax basis. Depending on your earnings, contribution rate and the amount of your bonus, the September bonus may result in you "maxing out" your pre-tax contribution early, thereby resulting in a loss of firm matching contributions for the remainder of the year -- unless you elect to contribute on a post-tax basis once you meet the pre-tax limit. To continue contributing to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a post-tax basis if you reach the pre-tax annual contribution limit, go to the Change Contribution Rates page at Benefits Express and select "Continue" in the box below your contribution rate (see below). Here’s an example of an election rate: Questions If you have any questions about your 401(k) elections, please contact Benefits Express at (877) PwC-BenX (792-2369). * If you were informed during your Career Outlook discussion that you will receive an Annual Performance Bonus, it will be deposited into your account at your designated financial institution on Friday, Sept. 28, less applicable taxes and your 401(k) contribution election.
