Make sure you’ve initiated, completed and acknowledged all Snapshots, including your self-Snapshot, which is now available. FYI Action The optional self-Snapshot is your opportunity to share your perspective on your progression and impact, including Digital Upskilling. Complete your self-Snapshot using this guide for examples of what to include. ICYMI: See this article for more on sharing your digital impact and highlighting your contributions to tech-enabling PwC. Snapshots are key data points in Career Roundtables along with your LoS Performance metrics (client service). Initiate, complete and acknowledge all Snapshots as soon as possible. All snapshots must be acknowledged in the system by April 30 with at least 80% of your total hours worked covered. Have questions? Reach out to your Talent Consultant, career coach or relationship leader. Advisory note: Snapshots for Advisory staff should include contributions to Digital Upskilling and to the development and adoption of our Integrated Solutions. Here is additional guidance on how to capture these important activities. Assurance note: Assurance staff who do not have 80% of total hours worked covered in Snapshots by 4/30 must follow the FY19 &lt;80% Hours Guidance. As a best practice, we suggest you initiate a practice contribution Snapshot to your Relationship Leader or Career Coach to assist you in reaching 80% of hours covered. Tax note: Snapshots for Tax staff should include contributions to Project 5 Million. Please see the Tax — Digital Impact through CRT slide for additional information on how to capture your P5M and digitization impact.

In January, Tim Ryan previewed changes including a simplified market and sector structure, and the redesign of our IFS functions. The changes to our market and sector structure go live on Monday. These changes are one of many ways our firm is changing and simplifying, so we can be more agile and responsive to our clients as their businesses change rapidly. By simplifying our market and sector structure, we’re also freeing up the time of some of our most experienced client service partners to focus on our clients. Our IFS functions are also moving forward with refreshed organizations and new ways of doing things. Here’s a reminder of what’s changing. Markets We’ve reduced the number of markets. Over time we expect these changes will make it easier to work together -- providing new career opportunities for our people and enhancing the quality and value we bring to our clients. As of Monday, your office won’t change, but the market you belong to will change for many. Click here for additional details on our updated markets leaders Sectors Industry developments have reshaped how our clients define themselves. Our new structure positions us to continue to deliver deep and relevant knowledge from across our sectors as our clients drive and adapt to change. Click here for additional details on our updated sectors structure and leaders Lines of service Our clients want and expect us to bring them the line of service capabilities, sector insight and market relationships that they value. To accomplish this, we work closely together across our firm. As we’ve restructured the markets and sectors, we’ve made corresponding changes to some line of service roles. You can find the updated line of service leadership teams through the links below. Assurance leadership Tax leadership Advisory leadership IFS redesign As we reimagine our business for the future, we’ve looked holistically across our IFS functions and service delivery model to make sure we have the right structure, programs, technology and processes in place to support our next phase of growth.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between October 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) in Q&amp;RM immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with National Q&amp;RM immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

Are you ready to PowerUp! your Digital Upskilling experience? HQ News Sept. 21, 2018 Last week, Tim Ryan announced our new firmwide LIVE trivia game, PowerUp!, which makes its debut today at 2 p.m. ET. PowerUp! Is just one of the ways we’ll all be getting Digitally Upskilled together this year. In the coming weeks, we’ll be introducing many other elements to our Digital Upskilling strategy, which you'll read more about below. In fact, today we’re excited to also introduce the home of all of our Digital Upskilling tools and resources, the Digital Hub. Read on to learn more. Are you ready to PowerUp!? -- make sure you’ve completed these three steps! You’ve downloaded the app, you’ve registered and you’ve even picked an awesome team name. You’re ready to play PowerUp! to win cash while boosting your digital skills and knowledge of our FY19 strategy. Our live, firmwide trivia game starts today. Didn’t get a chance to get the app yet? Don’t worry, you still have time to download, register and play. The PowerUp! app (available for both iOS and Android devices) is available via PwC’s App Store. IMPORTANT: Download the PowerUp! app from PwC’s App Store. Register NOW. If you wait until the last minute, you run the risk of missing questions, which will cost you (and your team if you choose to play as part of one). If you created a team, keep in mind that you MUST have at least two players, and no more than eight, for team play. If your team has only one player, you will not appear on the team leaderboard and will only be eligible to win as an individual. Any member can invite others to join, but to join a team, you must accept in the “Invitations” section of the app. If you’ve created a team, check your team NOW to make sure those you’ve invited have accepted their invitations to join so that you are eligible for team play! Introducing the Digital Hub PowerUp! is the first of our Digital Upskilling resources to launch in FY19, but there’s much more on the way! Coming soon, you’ll be able to find everything related to your Digital Upskilling journey on the Digital Hub.

The wait is over ... get ready to PowerUp! HQ News Oct. 29, 2018 Team, Get ready -- because we’re making a very big investment in you and our future. We’re going to make Your Tomorrow a reality for us and our clients with more learning, more technology so we can transform our engagements for even greater quality and value and more Be well, work well. This is a big journey that we’re on -- we don’t know of any other organization doing this kind of digital transformation at the scale and intensity that we’re doing it. But that doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun along the way. Today I want to introduce you to PowerUp! This is a live trivia game app that we built just for the people of PwC. When PowerUp! launches Sept. 21, we’ll have friendly competition, fun and prizes. For the first six weeks of PowerUp! we’ll compete on what we know about our strategy, about Your Tomorrow and about the emerging technologies that are driving change for our clients and our firm. You can find all the details and FAQs here -- but what is most important to know and do is to download the PowerUp! App (iOS or android) so you’re ready to play. You can play on your own, but the fun and knowledge will be multiplied by playing with your team. From Sept. 21 until our firmwide Town Hall on Oct. 30, we’ll have two live games per week -- on Tuesdays and Fridays at 2 p.m. ET -- and you’ll be playing for $35,000 in prize money each week. (Partners can play along and be part of the fun but aren’t eligible to win.) After these first six weeks, we will continue games on Tuesdays, mainly focused on digital upskilling. This will be exciting and very different. And we’ll also be building the knowledge we need to bring our strategy to life, develop the skills we need to be successful now and in the future. That’s what I call fun with a purpose -- and our purpose is to secure the future for us and the PwCers who come after us. Have fun, and let’s PowerUp! to win together!! -------------------------- Here’s how it works: First, you’ll need to download the PowerUp! App (available for both iOS and Android devices) from PwC’s App Store. Due to the live nature of the game, it’s critically important that you do this as soon as possible so that when the game begins you’re ready to go! Follow the process in-app to register and set up your profile. Here are some additional tips for the best experience: (1) Allow notifications from the PowerUp! App via your phone settings (2) Use the best connection possible (e.g., Wifi or 4G mobile data) (3) Use portrait mode (4) Turn up the volume on phone (please use headphones in open spaces so as not to disturb others) During the challenge period, the game will be played every Tuesday and Friday at 2 p.m. ET. You’ll receive an invitation pushed directly to your calendar to hold the time. You can play as an individual player OR create a team or join an existing one! Note: You can only be on one team at a time. You’ll need to decide prior to playing the game if you want to play on a team. You can join an existing team or create one of your own; anyone can form a team of between 2-8 players, and invite others to join. You will have to accept an invite to join a team. On a team, you will have the chance to win as an individual and with your team since your individual score will still be counted. Teams can change each game and can be defined any way you choose (e.g., engagement team, Development Team, or just a group of colleagues you’d like to play the game with). Points are assessed both as individuals and, for those on teams, each individual’s score will be averaged together with their fellow team members to form a team score (NOTE: Team members must answer the first question to have their score averaged in with their team members to form the team score). While you may switch teams, any previous points that were averaged into a prior team’s score will remain part of that team’s score. At 2 p.m. ET, open the app and you’ll see a countdown until the game begins, then be joined by a live host. Once the game starts, you’ll answer around 10 multiple choice questions. You must read and answer each question in 15 seconds or less to receive points for a correct answer. If you get a question wrong, no worries -- you are not eliminated, you just won’t receive any points. At the end of the game, the individuals and teams who score the highest number of points across the firm (total for individuals and averages among teams) will see immediately in the app if they’ve won, and how much of the $17,500 per game (for a total of $35,000 per week) prize they will receive. The prize money won is proportional to the number of individuals and teams who win each game. In order to cash out, you’ll need to win at least $15 -- depending on the number of individuals playing, you could reach that amount immediately, or it may take multiple wins to be able to cash out. You can also choose to hold off on cashing out until your reach a higher award amount. Note: The cashout feature will not be available until after Oct. 1. Prior to then, you will just accumulate winnings in your player bank in the app. Once you cash out, you’ll receive an AMEX gift cheque or payroll reimbursement in the amount of your winnings. At the end of the 6-week challenge, we’ll also be announcing grand prize winners, or teams that, over the course of the challenge, played an above-average number of games and got the highest average points, at the firmwide Town Hall, where they’ll receive a fabulous prize live on air from Tim Ryan! A full set of contest rules is available here.

Take the Energy Audit, and learn more about managi What's your score? Take the Energy Audit, and learn more about managing your energy … one habit at a time Human Capital Oct. 17, 2017 At last week’s Town Hall, Tim Ryan talked about Your Tomorrow and what it means for our people. A key component of this strategy is helping you manage your well-being -- and given the pace and complexity of change we are all experiencing, we know well-being matters. Be well, work well is all about the firm putting the power of its resources behind you and supporting your journey to greater well-being. See where you stand: Take the Energy Audit by Nov. 1. Being well isn’t about being better at managing your time, which is a finite resource. It’s about learning how to better manage your energy, which is a renewable resource you can systematically increase and regularly renew. And that doesn’t mean squeezing more out of you; it’s the firm’s way of helping you remain energized -- both at work as well as when you leave work, so you can accomplish more, in less time, in a more sustainable manner. To operate at our best, both personally and professionally, we need very different sources of energy: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. These represent our four dimensions of energy and none is sufficient on its own. Thousands of our people have already adopted habits that have improved their lives, based on training in Discover, IFS New Manager or other programs. Now, we will change our culture as we make well being a core part of experience. We know many of our clients are interested in this work as well, and it’s an opportunity to share what we are also learning. Well-being is also aligned with the PwC Professional framework expectation of managing self and team energy. How can you start your journey toward improved well-being? Use the firm resources by visiting Be well, work well on Spark. Watch the overview video. Download the Habit Bank app from PwC's App Store. Read the blogs and listen to podcasts from partners and staff. Identify at least one well-being habit(s) that is useful to you, and discuss your plan with your career coach and teammates. Ask your relationship partner what habit she/he is working on and share your goal. Discuss your results in your team, share goals and how you can help each other with a team plan. See team plan templates here. Coming soon: Team Habit Challenge Some ideas ... Find a new habit to keep you and your team energized. For example, at your next team meeting, optimize your time together. Have a device-free meeting or take 10 minutes and go for a walk. Share your Be well, work well habits during your team meetings, and encourage each other to stay on track. What else do I need to know and do?

Including the following steps in the engagement signoff process may save you time, as well as reduce the firm's risk of data loss: 1- Review any legal, regulatory or contractual requirements associated with your specific engagement (including any OGC Preservation Notices). Check the Retention Type for your engagement and ensure it correctly indicates the type of engagement. If you have any questions, review the Firm's record-retention policy (U.S. Records management and document retention policy). Review the Tax line of service documentation policies (Tax Documentation policy). 2- Place any electronic information that must be retained in relevant Document Repositories (e.g., DMS, AURA and Map). Remove any electronic information for the engagement from other places it may be stored including email, laptop, shared drives, Google Drive, Team Drive, etc. 3- Review the access to DMS and consider whether some staff access should be removed as they no longer need on-going access. PwC Tax policy on Confidentiality and DMS Access. 4- If there are hard copy work papers that cannot be scanned, promptly file in the Records Center. 5- Properly secure information saved in electronic format and retained with physical work papers (e.g., encrypt or password protect electronic files saved on CD or disk and stored with physical work papers, storing passwords in a separate email or file section). 6- Any excess information that does not need to be kept for documentation purposes must be returned to the entity or individual from whom the information was collected. Alternatively, if the information does not need to be retained or returned, destroy any hard copy information and delete any electronic information from all storage devices. 7- Redact or remove pieces of information that identify clients, companies or individuals, where applicable, from sample proposals and deliverables before posting information to resources such as knowledge repositories and websites (e.g., remove personal information or client names before posting information on internal knowledge sharing websites). Visit Tax Source for additional information on Tax Data Security, Confidentiality and Your Responsibility, and E&amp;C’s Information Protection Principles document for definitions of the above terms. If you become aware of or suspect a situation where information has or could become lost, please immediately report it to the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS).

If completed after Sept. 23 points will be credited after Oct. 1. Check out the How to Earn section in the app or desktop for more details on how you can earn points. Remember: The more you do, the more you earn. Visit the Well-Being Rewards site or access the app each day to view daily cards, track your progress, participate in challenges and more to maximize your rewards! How do the points and rewards work? You can earn up to $500 in rewards each plan year (July 1-June 30) through the Well-Being Rewards Program. When you accumulate enough points to reach each level during the quarter, you earn the PulseCash associated with that level. For example, once you earn 2,000 points, you earn $10 PulseCash for achieving level one. Then, when you earn 3,000 more points (for a total of 5,000 points during the quarter), you earn the PulseCash associated with level two ($20 PulseCash). This also applies to levels three and four. Once the quarter is over, your points will reset to zero and you’ll start fresh in the new quarter earning points toward levels and PulseCash rewards; you’ll keep whatever PulseCash you may have earned during the quarter. In addition, you can receive up to an additional $100 per year when you complete additional activities under the program -- for example, $50 for undergoing a routine preventive exam. PulseCash is considered taxable income at the time it is earned and posted in your Well-Being Rewards account. PulseCash can be redeemed for gift cards, merchandise, donated to charity, or the cash can be deposited to your bank account (via desktop only). Not registered for Well-Being Rewards yet?

The Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge has been no exception. In an effort to bring the entire firm along on our digital journey and collectively focus on how we can all be our best with our Be well, work well initiative, we put forth a challenge. This week we made it super-clear with 5 Ways, 5 Days. While the deadline is still a few weeks away on May 15, we also know you want to start making your plans for the July 4th holiday. So … here’s the deal. While we can’t declare victory just yet, we have been making excellent progress and I do want to say go ahead and make your plans because YOU’RE GETTING THE JULY 4th WEEK OFF! BUT nothing in life is free, and here’s the catch. We still need you to complete the challenge. I know we’re a deadline-driven culture, and many of us wait til the last minute. My ask is simple. Please take the time -- now or next week -- but do it before the May 15 deadline. And if you’ve already met the challenge, help someone else get over the finish line. Your Tomorrow is important not just for us as a firm, but for you and your career. We’re getting time off -- and we’re also building skills that will help us be successful at work and in life! And that’s a journey that never ends. I look forward to seeing how you use your #PwCTakesABreak time -- share your pics and stories on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram!

We've got some exciting announcements that Got a case of the Mondays? We've got some exciting announcements that are sure to cure what ails you! HQ News April 2, 2018 Tim Ryan: Wherever I travel, I spend time meeting with PwC people -- and with partners who are passionate about the experience our people have at PwC. What I hear is you want to be your best at work and in life. You want to be able to care for yourself and those around you. You want to do work that matters and be recognized and rewarded for doing a great job. And you want to charge up your careers through opportunities like our Digital Accelerator program (as a reminder, Digital Accelerator self nominations close on April 13, so be sure to submit yours soon). We hear you -- and as we enter the final quarter of a very strong year, this seems like the perfect time to say "thank you" in a few different ways. First, as you may have heard from our partners, we're giving a Be well bonus to the people of PwC. The ask is that you use this to invest in yourself (and share your story to inspire others, if you are comfortable doing so). Second, if results continue as we expect, we will be increasing our annual performance bonus pool. Finally, we’re excited to share some meaningful enhancements to our benefits that are designed to support you in caring for your family. So, keep reading to learn more … and don’t worry, this is not a belated April Fool’s Day joke! It’s just our way of saying “thank you” for all you do for our clients, partners, people and firm, each day. A special thanks for the thousand things you do Our business is strong, thanks to your hard work and dedication to delivering quality service to our clients, working together as One Firm and living our purpose and values in all you do. That’s why, on behalf of the partners of PwC, we’re thrilled to announce that a special, one-time $1,000 Be well bonus will be paid next month! Why is this called a “Be well” bonus? It’s simple: Be well, work well -- part of our Your Tomorrow strategy -- is all about everyday behaviors and habits focused on fueling the four dimensions of energy: mental, spiritual, physical and emotional. These dimensions have been proven to help us become and sustain our best selves, both personally and professionally. However you choose to use this bonus, we hope you invest in something that boosts your energy in one of these areas, in a way that is most meaningful to you. Our ask of you -- if you feel comfortable doing so -- is that you share how you plan to spend your bonus to boost one of the four dimensions of energy, so that it may inspire others. You can do so either on social media using the hashtag #bewellworkwell or via email. We’ll feature a selection of the stories we receive on PwC Inside, via our social media pages and in other communications. *The fine print: All US staff in Assurance, Tax, Advisory and IFS are eligible to receive this payment, including those on reduced-hour schedules. Individuals must be hired and working on or before April 15 and on the US headcount as of the payment date (May 15, 2018) in order to receive this one-time payment, which aligns with our annual bonus payment criteria. For further details, read our Be well bonus FAQs. Recognizing exceptional performance: Announcing a potential increase in our bonus pool As with all of our Total Rewards, our goal is to provide meaningful rewards that are market competitive and aligned to our business performance. That’s why, assuming our results stay on track (and we believe they will), we’ll increase our incentive bonus pool up to an additional 10%! To be clear, this doesn’t mean that bonuses will necessarily increase by 10% -- it simply means that our leaders will potentially have a larger pool of resources to recognize differentiated performance through the bonus pool, if we continue to experience strong business performance throughout the rest of the fiscal year. We’ll keep you updated as we get closer to year-end. The fine print: Bonus pools are discretionary and may vary from year-to-year, and by line of service or staff level. If uplifted, each LoS will allocate this year’s uplift to the bonus pool in a way that meets the needs of their business. For example, these funds could be allocated by market, business unit, practice and/or impact. To learn more about bonus compensation, as well as all of our Total Rewards, visit our Rewards Strategy Spark site. You can also read more about the potential bonus pool increase in these FAQs. Supporting families through enhanced benefits From expanding your family through adoption, birth or surrogacy, to caring for a parent or loved one, we take pride in investing in programs and policies that support a broad range of family needs. We also continuously evaluate the competitiveness of our benefits in the market, and make adjustments as needed so you can be your best at work and in life. That’s why we’re pleased to announce several enhancements to our time-off policies related to family leave, including an additional two weeks of paid parental leave and four weeks of paid family care leave. We are also offering improvements to other family benefits including adoption and surrogacy, as well as membership to sittercity.com and eldercare consultation services. The fine print: These enhancements to our family benefits will be effective July 1, 2018. To learn more about these changes, read the Family Benefits FAQs.

If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between January 1, 2018, and March 31, 2018, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) in Q&amp;RM immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with National Q&amp;RM immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

Perform some formatting magic A little formatting magic lets mobile attendees join with just a tap, without struggling with the code. To accommodate all devices, include both of these formats in your invites: iPhone users: 888-555-1212,,,8675309# Android users: 888-555-1212 Access Code: 8675309# Never put words directly in front of the phone number without a space (Dial-in, Conf call, etc.). If you do, the dialing function may not work. 2. Not the location you’re looking for When Google says “location,” they mean it — a literal address. If you put anything else in this field, the calendar interprets it as a place and things can get messy. Put dial-in info in the “Add description” field. If your meeting has both a room number and a dial-in, list them separately to help apps like Dial My Meeting discern the appropriate code. 3. Meet and exceed expectations Skip all the special fields and formats by using Google Meet, our best platform for calls and virtual meetings. By simply selecting the “Add conferencing” option, your meeting invite will automatically include a Google Meet link and phone dial-in. To join the meeting via mobile phone, simply tap the phone number. If you have trouble finding the dial-in on the iOS native calendar, tap “Show All Notes” at the bottom of the invite, then tap the phone number. After the call connects, enter the code by tapping “Dial…” (next to the red button). For even faster dialing, connect through the Google Calendar app available in PwC’s App Store.

It enhances your ability to plan and track your engagements and better enables our teams to manage engagement economics. With Tax already using this tool, we customized FlexForecast to use in Advisory with our One Firm strategy in mind. Wait ... eFIT and APT are going away? As you heard in a recent email from your Vertical Operations Leader, we will retire eFIT and APT Lite on November 30 (Deals and Public Sector will continue to use their current pricing tools). Shortly thereafter, the Flex ID that is assigned when you create a new budget in FlexForecast, will be required to open a WBS code for any engagement. Where do I learn more about FlexForecast? Start with this 90-second video. If you haven’t already, register for one of the training sessions that your Vertical is running. It is expected that all partners and staff attend one of these sessions and registration and attendance will be tracked. If you’ve registered, but didn’t yet add the session to your calendar, you can do that here. You can also check out the FY18 Advisory Profitability App for easy access to guidance and resources that will enable you to get the greatest value out of FlexForecast. When can I start using FlexForecast? It’s live and ready to be used. Access FlexForecast today and attend one of the upcoming training sessions. The sooner we start using it, the sooner we’ll have the ability to price and budget more accurately and use the estimate to complete to track against actuals for greater insight into our engagement economics.

Pay pre-tax for parking and public transportation -- with n Commuters! Pay pre-tax for parking and public transportation -- with new higher limits starting New Year's Day National Benefits Dec. 7, 2017 If you take public transportation to work or pay for parking -- even if you only commute a few days a week -- you may want to consider how the Commuter Benefits Program can make a valuable difference. PwC cares: Lower costs for your commute or parking by paying with pre-tax money The Commuter Benefits Program allows you to set aside pre-tax earnings each pay period in a WageWorks account. In turn, you use these pre-tax dollars to pay for work-related transit and/or parking expenses. In fact, using pre-tax dollars for expenses you’re already paying for can save you up to 30% of your commuting costs because you save on federal taxes, state taxes (in most states) and FICA. New 2018 monthly contribution limits The IRS governs pre-tax commuter benefits and recently announced new pre-tax contribution limits effective Jan. 1, 2018. 2017 Limit 2018 Limit Transit $255 $260 Parking $255 $260 You can start, increase, decrease or stop your contribution amount at any time throughout the year at wageworks.com. Maximum parking/transit account balance Starting on Jan. 1, 2018, parking and transit account balances at WageWorks will be limited to a maximum of $1,500. If you have both types of accounts, you may have $1,500 in each. Monthly payroll deductions will be stopped if your account balance(s) exceed the $1,500 maximum. You will then need to enroll in payroll deductions again, once your balance(s) are spent down. Learn more For more information about enrollment and eligible expenses, or to elect or change a contribution amount: Visit wageworks.com. Call WageWorks at 877-WageWorks (877-924-3967). Representatives are available Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. Review the Commuter Benefits Program Description. If you are logged into myKcurve, click here. The Commuter Benefits Program is available to active US staff receiving US pay only. The following are not eligible to enroll in the Commuter Benefits Program: - Interns and temporary employees - Partners and principals - Staff of the Puerto Rico and Mexico offices We strongly encourage Flexibility2TM Talent Network staff not to elect participation because of the timing of benefits. If elected, reimbursement generally can only be made for eligible expenses while employed with the firm. Any remaining funds are forfeited.

The new policies take effect Jan. 1, 2018, barring any changes resulting from tax reform. (Please note: These changes apply to US partners and staff; guidance for Mexico and non-US SDCs will come separately.) The changes start with what many of you asked for: clearer guidance on reasonable spending. We’ve clarified expense policies and added dollar spend limits where it makes sense. Here are the highlights: More flexibility to manage meal expenses when you travel, in the way that’s right for you. Daily limits for out-of-town individual travel meals (including lunch and snacks!) $100 USD per day in high-dollar locations (locations to be announced in December) $75 USD per day in all other locations Travel policies are largely the same, and booking is even easier We’ve simplified the travel booking process, so only in-policy options are now displayed. You’ll still have abundant choices for flights, hotels and car rentals. Be sure to always use the firm-approved Concur Travel/Voyager tool -- using the tool means Security and Travel teams can support you in case of emergency. We’re also working on a new, easy-to-use expense system to be launched in spring/summer 2018. The system will be automated and mobile-friendly -- and best of all, compliance is built into the front end, to help you prevent issues before they happen. Continue using the Mobile Expense system and stay tuned to PwC Inside for launch details next year. Questions?

The only DMS sign-off required will be at the DMS Job/Project folder levels (see Section 6 in the TFS Process policy for guidance on finalizing the engagement file). Note that the DMS document sign-off functionality will still be available if engagement teams would like to continue signing off on documents (e.g., for tracking purposes and/or contemporaneous evidence of four-eyes review and partner sign-off). (However, evidence of four-eye review and partner sign-off can also be documented via a memo to the file, completed and signed Tax Engagement Checklist, completed and signed CP/SMS Review Form, emails indicating review, etc.) For additional assistance on documentation and Tax File Standard rules, please refer to the Documentation Toolkit which includes various resources relating to documentation, including firm policies and procedures, checklist templates and tools, etc. In addition, please access the Tax Project Folder listing in each DMS Administrative folder to understand what type of documentation should be included in DMS. Contact any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions. _______________________________________________________________ *Note that this change does not currently apply to IAS DMS version as document sign-off is used as a control for publishing documents to Tiger.

The timing of engagement teams obtaining an approved AFS as part of the engagement set-up process matters in terms of complying with our independence policy. As illustrated below, an AFS form must be approved by the Responsible Partner listed in CES prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. (Note, when providing certain services, you may need to obtain AFS approval from a Secondary Independence Reviewer by adding “AFS SoSRteam” as an Approver on the AFS – see link.) When providing non-audit services to a restricted entity and/or their affiliates, the engagement set-up sequence is important... 1. Check CES; If restricted initiate AFS &amp; engagement assessment process 2. Receive AFS approval from Responsible Partner in CES 3. Complete engagement acceptance assessment 4. Execute engagement contract 5. Begin work The foregoing "sequence" is an essential part of maintaining our independence with respect to non-audit services (a professional responsibility for each of us to manage on our engagements). Best practices to keep in mind: · An AFS is required for all non-audit services provided to restricted entities and/or their affiliates and global priority accounts listed in the Central Entity Service (CES) system and/or in the Global Priority Account (GPA) list included on the Global Client Portal (most easily accessed from the Engagement Acceptance Assessment). Note, a restriction designation is more than an entity being an audit client of the firm. An AFS is required for all restricted entities and/or their affiliates as designated in CES. · An approved AFS must be obtained prior to executing an engagement contract with a restricted client and/or their affiliates. · An approved AFS must be obtained prior to starting work on the engagement – Tax Time Charging Policy. · If the nature of the services changes from what was included in the original and approved AFS, a new AFS and updated contract may be required. Engagement teams should consult with the Responsible Partner in CES to determine if a new AFS is required. If required, a new AFS must be submitted and approved prior to the execution of the amended/revised engagement contract and the commencement of work. If the Responsible Partner determines that a new AFS is not required, the engagement team should document the conclusion in the DMS Administrative folder. · If the CES database indicates that an AFS is required, and you believe the CES database does not contain the correct information regarding the restriction status of a client, submit an AFS and consult with the Responsible Partner listed in CES. If an AFS is not required according to the Responsible Partner, the engagement team should document the conclusion and file it in the DMS Administrative folder. · Engagement teams should prepare an AFS for each year/12 month period of a multi-year contract. It is important that all engagement team members be aware of and comply with our non-audit service independence policies, by understanding the rules and the procedures to be followed to facilitate overall team compliance. For additional information regarding the AFS process -- including assessing permissibility of services, the AFS Process Sequence, protocols regarding Charging Time, and Scope Creep -- see the Tax Independence – AFS Quick Reference.

Some of these devices may be recording or monitoring your activities, even when not in active use. Perhaps you saw the reports of personal conversations being recorded and shared with complete strangers — the danger is real. Your personal, family or firm information could end up somewhere you don’t want it. Yikes! To help protect yourself, we recommend these guidelines: Don’t use smart speakers or other internet-connected devices for firm business. Additionally, turn off the device or move out of range during confidential discussions. Keep your devices secure by using complex passwords. For more, see PwC’s password guidance. Keep work and personal passwords different, and don’t share passwords across devices. Enable two-factor authentication whenever available. This provides an extra layer of security against unauthorized access.

Two exciting updates What's next for Your Tomorrow? Two exciting updates HQ News Dec. 19, 2017 Team, When I think about where we’ll be one year from now, here’s what I see: Our firm will be more digital, and we’ll all have raised our digital IQ so we can deliver the tech-enabled experience that the market is demanding. Our culture of One Firm teaming will be even stronger, which means we’ll be delivering even greater quality and value. And -- team by team -- we’ll be supporting each other in being our best selves at work and in our lives. It’s going to take all of us, working together, to reach our goals. I’m confident we can get there, and have some fun along the way, and I have two exciting updates that I want to tell you about today. Meet the challenge -- get an extra-long July 4 break We’ve listened to your feedback, and what you’ve told us is that our firmwide shutdowns are something you truly value. When we take time off together, we can really unplug and get away. With that in mind, we’ve created a special firmwide challenge. If, as of May 15, 2018, we achieve the following goals around Your Tomorrow, we will shut down the firm for the entire week of July 4! To make this happen, we’ll each get the July 4 holiday, plus three additional days off. Then, similar to our December holiday break, we’ll each give one vacation day to round out the week. Here are the goals we want to meet so we accelerate our progress on Your Tomorrow. This is a real win-win -- we not only build skills that will help us be successful at work and in life -- we have the potential for more summer fun, too. Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off Salesforce Digital Fitness Be well, work well The goal: 90% of us with a Salesforce license have signed into Salesforce and have achieved a Client IQ score of 150 or higher. How to get started: Salesforce is live! If you are a Salesforce user, get in and try it out. But even if you are not, you can support the use of Salesforce by asking partners and managers to share dashboards during meetings, and checking with them to be sure opportunities are captured. The goal: 90% of us take the Digital Fitness assessment and complete two or more quizzes. How to get started: If you haven’t already, be sure todownload the Digital Fitness app from PwC’s App Store or access the web version of the tool and take the assessment, then share your results with your team. The goal: 90% of us take the energy audit, visit the Habit Bank and are part of at least one Be well, work well team plan. How to get started: To date, nearly 20,000 PwCers have taken the Energy Audit. And you and your team can take it to the next level by committing totwo new daily habits through our team challenge -- The habit -- and integrating them into your routine. Coming in January -- another opportunity to help accelerate our digital agenda One important reason for the Your Tomorrow, Our Time Off challenge is that we want to build the digital skills of every person in the firm. By the end of FY19, we are working on getting to ‘Digital Basic’ -- that means each of us will have the baseline level of digital skills we need to be part of our digitally-enabled firm. We’ll all drive our own learning using the Digital Fitness assessment and personalized learning paths. After we come back from the holiday break, we’ll give you the opportunity to nominate yourself to be part of the first wave of Technology Accelerators at PwC. We’ll be selecting several hundred people from across our business to go through specialized training this year -- well beyond Digital Basic -- and then work with teams across our firm to accelerate adoption and impact of new technology tools.

Engagement teams should normally begin the client acceptance process well before the first engagement is won for a prospective client. Not only will this allow for the completion of the client acceptance process before an engagement acceptance decision is required, but completing the process early in the pursuit process will avoid an investment of time in a prospective client that does not meet our client acceptance standards. In certain limited circumstances, engagement teams may need to begin work on an engagement before the client acceptance process is fully completed. In such situations, it may be appropriate for the engagement team to request an accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance exception via the GFS Risk Management Exception process (“conditional request”). Once obtained, an approved conditional request enables the engagement team to issue an engagement letter and obtain a charge code prior to the completion of full client acceptance. An approved conditional request does not replace or serve as a substitute for the firm's full client acceptance process. Accordingly, the conditional request process is used only in specific, limited circumstances. Moreover, even where conditional request is provided, the engagement team must complete the full client acceptance process immediately following receipt of a conditional request. &gt;&gt;&gt; The current client acceptance process, in which Salesforce is the system of record for client acceptance status rather than the A&amp;C system, can take as little as three days when no adverse data is found. Teams should submit an ADS request as soon as a prospective client is created in Salesforce. In most cases, the prospective client will be accepted in Salesforce by the time the entity is validated and added to the A&amp;C system. &lt;&lt;&lt; An accelerated, but conditional, client acceptance can be obtained by submitting a conditional request for a "New Client Entity" (not a "New Engagement/WBS Code") through the GFS Risk Management Exception Code Release Database (click here). A link to the database can also be found in the Quick Links on the Acceptance and Continuance Homepage. Conditional requests will be considered only when the following criteria are met: · The engagement team establishes that it needs to start work immediately due to a time-sensitive opportunity (i.e., the engagement team has won the work and confirmed the deliverable deadline, which does not allow sufficient time for the completion of the standard client acceptance process); · As a result of due diligence conducted by the engagement team, the engagement partner is confident that the results of the ADS performed under the full client acceptance process will not raise any reputational, financial or other concerns that would cause us to decline working for the prospective client; and · The engagement team created the Client and submitted an opportunity in Salesforce and submitted an ADS request. The ADS request should include the appropriate members of prospective client’s management, board members and/or investors/shareholders (e.g., CEO, President, CFO, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, VP of Tax/ Director, Chairman of the Board, Audit Committee Chair and/or key investors/shareholders). It is important that the engagement partner be involved in the entire client acceptance process, including the conditional request process. The firm's client acceptance process is a fundamental firm policy and risk management control. The engagement partner is responsible for the proper consideration of all risk management policies and procedures on their engagements. The GFS Exception does not replace the Adverse Data Search and A&amp;C client acceptance assessment process, if required. In general, client acceptance in A&amp;C is required for new, non-audit clients of the US/Mexico firm (generally at the Ultimate Domestic Parent entity level) when: · Adverse data has been identified by the ADS team and you have been instructed to complete a client acceptance assessment in A&amp;C · The prospective client is a foreign entity with no US or Mexico operations (regardless of ADS finding · Your team feels that input from Risk Management or Business Leadership is required to evaluate this new client (regardless of ADS findings) Full client acceptance must be complete in accordance with the instructions provided by the ADS team as soon as possible, and in no event, later than within six weeks of obtaining an approved conditional request. Teams need to perform due diligence and submit supplemental information along with a conditional request to facilitate the expedited, conditional client acceptance evaluation process, which includes responding to the questions listed below. When gathering supplemental information, do not solely rely on the prospective client’s website but rather perform due diligence using resources such as Factiva Google, Google News, Bloomberg, and other reputable tools and share the sources used. The supplemental information includes the following: · Identify the prospective client and briefly describe the related ownership/organizational structure and its business. · Describe the nature and scope of the services to be performed. · Briefly describe PwC's relationships (e.g., lead tax partners, other relevant relationships) with the potential new client, if any. · If the client is referred to us from another PwC member firm, obtain a copy of that member firm's client acceptance or similar information that would be helpful in making the US firm's assessment (e.g., is the prospective client an accepted Assurance, Tax and/or Advisory client of the member firm, how recent was the client acceptance completed by the member firm). · In the event our relationship with the prospective client is limited, perform due diligence on the company, its executives/significant shareholders, directors or the individual client, as appropriate, and provide a copy of the information obtained and the sources from which it was obtained. · Provide list of client’s board members/senior management and link to relevant information regarding such persons. · Identify potential risk factors/basis for your assessment of potential risk factors (e.g., litigation with other service providers, vendors/clients, employees/board members, financing concerns). · Identify potential conflicts of interest. · Document the engagement partner's conclusion as to whether the client should be conditionally accepted as a client, and why. · Identify any reasons to question the integrity of the prospective client, subsidiaries, management team, and shareholders/owners and/or partners. · Provide potential client website link. · Confirm that an ADS has been requested. Important reminders: An approved conditional request DOES NOT replace a Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment requirement. A Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment must be completed in the A&amp;C system for each and every engagement. Resource: Click here to see the "New Client Acceptance Reference Guide - Salesforce".

It is also important that we collaborate with our clients regarding the importance of obtaining timely extensions and filing their tax returns on time. This communication is being issued as part of an ongoing effort to remind engagement teams of the revised due dates for certain tax returns, now entering into the second filing season for which such due dates are applicable, and the steps you can take with clients to reduce the instances of penalties for late-filed returns, missed extension requests, etc. Certain clients may not be aware of the penalties for failure to file timely returns, or understand the time involved or the challenges associated with obtaining timely extensions. Based on recent experience, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain abatement of penalties. To avoid the unpleasant, and potentially costly, surprise of a penalty notice, engagement teams should make a concerted effort to discuss with clients the importance of establishing clear responsibilities for obtaining timely extensions and, if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions, ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting the responsibilities with your clients before extensions are due is an important part of managing this important aspect of engagement execution. For additional information regarding changes in due dates, click here. PwC’s Tax Controversy and Regulatory Services (TCRS) group and Tax Q&amp;RM have published the guidance below regarding the importance of extensions and related best practices. Please read the guidance and continue to collaborate with your clients around this important aspect of our client service. If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact a member of TCRS or Tax Q&amp;RM. Thank you for your efforts in serving clients and representing the firm. * * * * * * Tax Q&amp;RM and PwC’s TCRS group continues to assist engagement teams with requests for abatement of penalties assessed on late-filed returns. While most extensions are timely e-filed or paper-filed, TCRS is seeing penalties assessed in part because: · When preparing to e-file an extension, the person responsible for making certain the extension is accepted by the IRS believes the extension has been e-filed when, in fact, the final act of “sending” or “transmitting” the extension never took place (i.e., “pushing the button” did not take place) or the IRS did not accept the extension. · PwC e-files some extensions and prepares a paper copy of other extensions for filing by the client. The client believes PwC has e-filed an extension when, in fact, PwC has sent a paper extension to the client to mail to the taxing authority. · When filing a paper extension by mail, the person submitting the extension believes that it is timely mailed by generating a mailing label using “SimpleCertifiedMail” or by merely dropping it off in the mail room when, extra steps should be taken to ensure it is processed timely to the U.S. Post Office so there is no risk that the extension would not be considered timely. · For both new and existing clients, the party responsible for e-filing or paper filing the extension is not clearly identified before the due date for filing the extension. · Lack of awareness regarding new due dates for certain tax returns. Recommendations Engagement teams should collaborate with our clients regarding extensions. Engagement teams should discuss with clients the importance of obtaining timely extensions and ensure that we are appropriately compensated for our services if we are engaged to prepare and file the extensions. In some instances, our clients will prefer to prepare and file extensions themselves. Documenting in writing the responsibilities with your clients before the due date for filing the extension is an important aspect of such client collaboration. To avoid the unpleasant surprise of an IRS penalty notice, clients and PwC engagement teams should make a concerted effort to discuss the following before the due date for filing the extension: · Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for preparing the extension (does the engagement letter with the client discuss responsibility for preparing and submitting the extension?); · Who at the client or at PwC has responsibility for e-filing or paper filing the extension; · Who at the client or at PwC will obtain proof of timely filing of the extension (e.g., an electronic confirmation from the IRS that the extension was received; a copy of the U.S. Certified Mail – return receipt form; or a tracking number from one of the private delivery services listed in IRS Notice 2016-30); and · Who at the client or at PwC should provide proof to the other party of timely filing of the extension prior to the original due date? This step of providing proof of the filing of the various extensions prior to the original due date can be an essential step in helping to ensure that all extensions have been properly filed – like other aspects of engagement execution this process should have four-eyes review and appropriate partner involvement. No extension request should be considered as having been filed until proof of filing is obtained. The reviewer on the engagement should ensure that proof of filing on, or preferably before, the statutory deadline for timely filing an extension request (i.e., original due date of return) has been saved in the DMS tax file. Best Practice Suggestions · Review the revised statutory due dates for certain tax returns. In light of changes to the due dates for certain tax returns, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015, familiarize yourself with the new due dates as they will impact the time period for requesting extensions. For additional information on the new due dates, click here. To the extent you have any questions about the new dates, please consult with a member of the TCRS group (for federal tax matters) or a SALT SMS (for state and local tax matters). · Review the e-Filing Procedures With Your Team. We have heard from a number of engagement teams that, after receiving the extension communication in prior years, team members met to review the steps required for e-filing extension requests, and the procedures for confirming that the taxing authority accepts extension requests. We encourage you to consider discussing extensions and e-file procedures with your team members in an effort to mitigate the risk of missed extensions. · Review the Extension Form. Review the extension form to ensure that all required information is included in the extension and that questions and boxes have been appropriately addressed. · Proof That an Extension Has Been Successfully e-Filed. After electronically transmitting the extension to the IRS or state tax agency, you should receive an acknowledgement showing the status of the extension. Typically, the software used to e-file an extension generates an “acceptance” receipt from the IRS. A receipt that contains the status as “Accepted” is proof that the IRS accepted the form. If the receipt contains the status as “Acknowledged,” it is not proof that the IRS accepted the form. Please discuss with your compliance team the procedures to obtain verification that the electronic transmittal of the extension was “Accepted” and the timing for performance of these procedures. Please see the sample screenshot from OneSource or GoSystem at the bottom of this note, which shows what PwC users should be reviewing to confirm that the e-filed extension submitted thru OneSource or GoSystem has been accepted. There is a similar process with those state revenue departments that require or permit e-filing. · Proof That a Paper Extension Has Been Mailed Timely. In some cases, PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and is authorized by the client to mail the extension to the IRS or state tax agency on behalf of the client. Familiarize yourself with the mailroom’s delivery times. It is recommended that time sensitive filings be delivered directly to the U.S. Post Office main window and that proof of acceptance by the U.S. Post Office (e.g., Certified Mail receipt stamped by the U.S. Post Office) is obtained. If you are using SimpleCertifiedMail to create mailing labels, there is a risk that the non-USPS receipt may not be sufficient to establish timely filing. In order to avoid any risk, you should ensure that you have an acceptance scan from the U.S. Post Office on that same date. Although recent case law has allowed the use of a non-USPS receipt date to govern timely filing, there is still an added risk and the above guidelines should be followed. · File an Extension Even If No Tax Due for Year. A tax return that reports a net operating loss, or no tax liability, can still lead to significant penalties being assessed if the return is not timely filed (e.g., returns filed late with Forms 5471, 5472, 8865, etc. attached). File an extension even if the return is expected to report no tax liability for the year. · File Extensions Early. An extension can be filed any time after the end of the tax year and before the original due date of the return for that year. A calendar year taxpayer may file an extension as early as January 1 of the following year. An extension may be filed without a payment, so long as the tax liability for the year is stated on the extension correctly. A corporate taxpayer’s reasonably estimated tax liability, however, must be paid on or before the due date of the return, excluding extensions. · When in Doubt, Call the IRS. The IRS does not notify taxpayers that an extension request has not been filed. If you are unsure of whether an extension is on file with the IRS, you may contact the IRS practitioner priority line at (866) 860-4259. You must have a Form 2848, Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative, ready to fax to the IRS if your authorization is not already on file with the IRS. · Due Date Has Passed and No Extension Was Filed. If the due date for filing the extension has passed, please consult with TCRS immediately. In the event that an extension was missed, a return was filed late, or penalties were assessed for the late filing of a return, please consult with TCRS and a Regional Tax Q&amp;RM Partner in accordance with our policy on Troublesome Practice Matters. Additional Discussion In various situations, our clients believe they or PwC filed a timely: · Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns; · Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return; or · Form 8868, Application for Extension of Time to File an Exempt Organization Return. A client may have PwC assist with filing an extension in several ways, including: 1. PwC is engaged to e-file the extension with the IRS on behalf of the client; 2. PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension, and then mails the extension to the client for the client to file with the IRS; 3. PwC is engaged to prepare a paper extension and mails the extension to the IRS on behalf of the client. If the IRS determines that the return is untimely because there is no extension on file with the IRS, penalties may be assessed under IRC sections 6651(a)(1) and 6651(a)(2) for failure to file a timely return and failure to pay tax timely. However, the largest penalty assessments TCRS is seeing are for late international information returns. Under an automated program, the IRS assesses a $10,000 civil penalty for each late filed: · Form 5471, Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect To Certain Foreign Corporations; and · Form 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business. Upon examination, the IRS may also assert additional delinquency penalties associated with other international information returns (e.g., Forms 8865, 8858, 926) that are not filed timely. States may impose similar penalties. These penalties are assessed whether or not the taxpayer has an income tax liability associated with the tax return. A late-filed original return also may jeopardize the validity of a tax election that must be made on a timely filed original return. For additional e-filing resources and information, click here.

Scroll down to View options and select Show declined events. If you select “No, only show invitations to which I have responded,” you’ll only see events on your calendar if you've specifically accepted an invitation. Since many large group meetings don’t have email invitations, they won’t be visible to you.

Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. Q&amp;RM’s Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR position is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. The Engagement Letters Index contains templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a privacy notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit and engagement letter templates or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period provides any tax service to a person in a financial reporting oversight role at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a financial reporting oversight role (FROR) in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)). Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Section 7216 consent must be obtained for all tax compliance and consulting engagements for individuals due to the nature of our business operations (e.g., use of GDM resources, third party contractors, back office support, etc.) and if the client requests that we disclose the client's tax return information to their representatives or professional advisors (e.g., the client's legal counsel, secretary, head (or CFO) of family office, etc.). This consent must be obtained prior to disclosing information to third parties. The consent must be signed by the client. Please note that the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information must be obtained annually, including in the case of a multi-year contract. Privacy Policy Notice Tax LOS policy requires that privacy notices be sent to clients when providing individual tax (compliance and consulting) services. The GLBA Privacy Notice must be provided when the client relationship commences. For existing clients, an annual notice must be provided every calendar year. Engagement teams should be sure to use the most current engagement letter templates from the Engagement Letters Index.

Below are highlights of some enhancements which may affect you as your teams continue to work with GDM. The Phoenix Spark page has valuable QRCs for each step of the process from creating and submitting an Engagement to submitting a Request and the workflow process around the Requests. In addition, please join the Phoenix Forum and use this platform to share best practices with each other and quickly get answers to your questions not already answered in the QRCs. Engagement Numbers - To help with organization and referencing we have made the Engagement numbers visible in both the Engagement Details as well as in the Engagement Request Package area of each submitted Request. Request Dashboard Simplification - My Requests and My Team Request Widgets have been combined into one simplified Service Requests Widget. Submission from the Engagements Widget and simplified buttons - You can now submit Requests directly from the Engagement widget in addition to the New Request or Reservation &gt; Service Request button. Note: Resource Request is not applicable for Tax at this time. Task Identification &amp; Reassignment for Engagement Teams - Within the Service workflow, at the bottom, of a Request you can identify who on your team has the My Task for a given action. (e.g., Review Deliverable as seen below). In addition, once a Task is claimed, anyone listed as an Engagement Team member on the request can reassign the task to a specific team member to review what GDM has prepared or to facilitate the process should a member of your team be unavailable to action the task. SDC Performing Team Dashboard - A new dashboard has been added for the SDC Delivery teams. Engagement Team members will see this dashboard on the home page, however it will not reflect their performing requests as it is intended for SDC use only.

You’ll learn more over the next couple of months, but for now here’s what you need to know about how our pricing plan will work in FY18. New for FY18: We’ve heard your EMT feedback, and have enhanced the system to allow EMT Engagement Monitoring functionality to be available prior to Leadership IPR approval. This will allow teams to continue to edit resources and hours within the EMT, and to send updates to TalentLink real time. In addition, FY18 EMT IPR approval will be at the new Mega Market level, and SAL/IAL approval is no longer required. We’ve also simplified leader approval to only the FY18 goal. Details on the approval thresholds for FY18 EMT IPR can be found here. FY18 Pricing Overview &amp; Office Hours for support FY18 EMT approvals will be based off of the realization commitments in the 3 year plan. Beginning in July 2017, Engagement Margin (EM) will be an output that we will actively monitor via the EMT Monitoring process. Our EM training on April 4 provided more detailed information on the new metric and how we’ll use it going forward. If you missed the webcast, you can view the replay here. Click here for additional resources including the slides from the training and a helpful QRC. You’ll also notice below that office hours will be held over the late spring and summer to further assist you with Engagement Margin and EMTs.

The Engagement Letter and Document Application (ELD) is a new tool to automate the creation and execution of engagement letters, reducing the risk of non-standard or outdated engagement terms. The ELD is available for engagement teams to create, review and send engagement letters electronically to the PwC Partner or Principal and client for their electronic signatures. The ELD reduces the time engagement teams are spending on contracting and streamlines the review and signature processes. Engagement letters can be easily created and executed within hours of sending to the client. Engagement teams are able to track the status of their engagement letters in one convenient place. The ELD can be accessed via Engagement Center or the ELD stand alone application. Engagement letters created in Engagement Center will be automatically filed in the DMS project folder when fully executed letters are received back from clients. The most popular, general templates are now available for creation in ELD with more on the way for all the practice groups. The templates currently available for use are: · Tax Compliance – Corporate EL · Tax Compliance – Partnership EL · PFS Compliance EL · PTPA Compliance EL · Tax Consulting Services EL · Recurring Services EL with Statement of Work (SOW) · Statement of Work under Recurring Services · Master Limited Partnership EL (restricted to MLP practice) · Coming soon: Transfer Pricing, Corporate Executive Program and Specialized Tax Services (STS) letters The current version of the ELD handles letters where clients accept our standard terms. Upgrades for even more versatility are scheduled and suggestions are welcomed. To learn more, visit the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite on Tax Source for additional information and training videos on how to create engagement letters within Engagement Center and how to upload a custom Statement of Work (SOW) template in ELD. A shorter walk-through video on the review and signature processes is also available for PwC Partners and Principals on the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite.

The new policies take effect Jan. 1, 2018, barring any changes resulting from tax reform. (Please note: These changes apply to US partners and staff; guidance for Mexico and non-US SDCs will come separately.) Highlights include: You'll have more flexibility to manage meal expenses when you travel, with daily limits for out-of-town individual travel meals (including lunch and snacks). Travel policies are largely the same; we’ve simplified the travel booking process, so only in-policy options will be displayed in Concur Travel/Voyager (you’ll still have abundant choices for flights, hotels and car rentals). We’ll also launch a new, mobile-friendly expense system in spring/summer 2018. Compliance will be built into the front end, to help you prevent issues before they happen. Final travel and expense policies, including high-dollar locations where the $100 USD per day daily limit will apply, will be announced later this month and posted on the Finance Spark site. Watch PwC Inside for updates over the next few weeks. We’re also working through details for instances where client and hotel location differ, travel takes you through multiple cities on the same day, and how to handle group snacks. What do you need to do? Always use the firm-approved Concur Travel/Voyager tool -- it’s cost-effective, and our Security and Travel teams can support you in case of emergency. Continue using the Mobile Expense system to submit expenses until our new system launches in spring/summer 2018 (more details to come next year). Read up on the highlights of our new travel and expense reimbursement policies and watch for the actual policies later this month; they’ll be effective Jan. 1. Visit this Spark site for an overview and FAQs. Still have questions? Join us Friday, Dec. 15 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ET for our next Q&amp;A session, where representatives from Finance, Travel and Ethics &amp; Compliance will again be on hand to answer your questions right here on Spark. (Add a reminder to your Google Calendar - change your availability to “free” when you save.) Highlights from our Dec. 1 session are below. Highlights from Dec. 1 Q&amp;A session on Spark Thank you to everyone who joined our live chat last week. We had some great questions and dialogue. Here are a few highlights. Read the overview and FAQ documents on our Spark site for more details. Group meals when one person pays the tab: What happens when a team goes out together, and one person puts the tab on their corporate card? Travelers need to stay within their daily meal cost limit ($100 USD per person in high dollar locations / $75 USD per person in all other locations), and their share of the group meal counts toward that limit, so please exercise care and judgment in this area. The new expense system will tie the names of attendees to the group meal. While the system will not automatically subtract group meal allocations from individuals' available daily maximums, overages will be monitored. How to handle my advance grocery run, for when I’m traveling for the week: Often I'll go to a grocery store and get items for breakfast and lunch for the week. How would the new system handle this? This practice is acceptable, but daily limits apply each day and cannot be averaged over the course of your trip. Careful thought was put into establishing the daily maximum amount, which should be reasonable and sensible in most circumstances (even if breakfast/lunch is purchased at a grocery store for a few days). Will fully-refundable options still be available for flights? We do expect, unless there is a high probability of a trip change or cancellation before departure, that a non-refundable ticket be purchased. Fully refundable tickets will continue to be an option in Voyager/Concur Travel and partners and staff are expected to exercise reasonable judgment to determine whether a refundable airfare is more cost effective. Booking business or first class travel: Will upgrading to business/first class still be allowed, or is economy going to be the only option? Business class fares purchased on flights longer than 3 hours are allowed for partners, managing directors and eligible participants in PwC’s Frequent Traveler 75K program. Partners/staff not eligible for above coach seating may use frequent-flyer miles to upgrade, but only the coach ticket is reimbursable for North America (request the upgrade after purchase of the coach ticket). How will the new expense reporting system handle out-of-policy expenses? And what about receipts? We’ll share the full details when the new expense reporting system goes live in spring/summer 2018. But expenses that are not within policy will prompt one of the following responses based on how severely the expense is outside of policy: 1) a front-end alert visible to the expense submitter, 2) an approval request routed to the expense submitter’s leader, or 3) partial expense submission rejection (for the significantly out-of-policy portion of the expense). The new policies and system will have the same receipt requirements as before, but will save you time by allowing mobile uploads (once the new system is implemented in spring/summer 2018). Still have questions? For additional details on the expense policy changes, check out the overview and FAQ docs on the Finance Spark site.

Google uses machine learning to generate remarkably accurate, real-time captions — sometimes even self-correcting as it gathers additional context from the speaker. Impressive! Google Meet’s live captioning is a significant enhancement for professionals with hearing disabilities and non-native English speakers. It’s also helpful if you’re struggling to hear in a noisy environment (airports, anyone?). Or maybe you just forgot your earbuds and don’t want to disturb your colleagues. Live captions are not recorded or stored for future reference — they’re only available in the moment. I’m sold! How do I turn on live captions? Each participant controls captions on their own screen, and they’re only visible to that individual. Here’s how to turn on live captions on your PC: In Meet, select the triple-dot menu at the bottom-right. Select “Turn on captions.” Live captions are also available on Chromebox for meetings (using a remote) and Chromebase for meetings (using a touchscreen device). Learn more on Google Help Center.

Is it me you're looking for? Hello. Is it me you're looking for? PwC Technology July 26, 2018 Windows Hello is a new way to sign in to your PC with just a look or a touch. Your PC will recognize you using a fingerprint or face recognition, eliminating the need for a password. It’s secure, logs you in quickly, and you can always use your GUID password as backup. Your fingerprint or face never changes, meaning you’ll never be locked out of your laptop. Windows Hello works with any PwC laptop that has a fingerprint reader, and with laptops that have an infrared camera for facial recognition. Either way, Windows Hello recognizes you instantly. It’s a new way to use technology to simplify your workday. How do I get started? Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options Select the fingerprint and/or the face recognition option. A “Welcome to Windows Hello” box will pop up. Select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions. You’re not required to remember the PIN. It can be used once to register your fingerprint/face and then forgotten. If you’re ever prompted for your PIN, you can manually select to use your GUID password instead of the PIN. Your PIN must be at least 12 characters long It must include at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter It must include at least one number and one special character What options does your PC offer? Nearly all PwC PCs -- 92% -- are equipped to recognize your unique biometric login. Here’s an overview of their capabilities. Laptop model HP EliteBook x360 1030 G2 Dell XPS 13 (9365) HP EliteBook 840 G3 Dell Latitude E7470 Dell Latitude 7480 Dell Latitude 5285 Dell 5510/5520 Capability Camera/Fingerprint Camera/Fingerprint Fingerprint Fingerprint Fingerprint Unavailable Unavailable Concerned about privacy? Don’t worry -- the info that identifies you never leaves your PC. During setup, the camera or fingerprint reader creates a “data representation” similar to a graph, encrypts it and stores it on your PC. Actual images of your face or fingerprint are never captured on your device or elsewhere. Find out more about privacy. Want more tips and IT news?

It's another way we're modernizing and simplifying the way we work. We learned a lot from our successful Dallas pilot — and Mobile Only is coming to your office in 2019! So what’s it like to make the jump to our new way of working? We call it “Mobile Only” because you’ll only have a mobile phone number. However, that doesn’t mean you won’t have other communication options. Enclosed offices and conference rooms will have landline speakerphones with fixed local numbers, which can be used for incoming, outgoing and international calls. Open workstations will not have desk phones. You’ll be notified when it’s time for your assigned office to transition. Here’s what to expect: Your office landline phone number will be retired. You’ll have just one phone number and voicemail box. Simple. We’ll use mobile phones, Google Meet and WebEx. We’ll no longer use Jabber Softphone. Reception will connect callers with mobile phones (they will not give out numbers). Executive assistants will no longer answer partner phones. Your office’s main phone numbers and group numbers (like service centers) will remain unchanged. This is how we do it: Four ways to make calls when you’re in a Mobile Only office Don’t let the name Mobile Only fool you — you’ll still have lots of options to place calls. You can use … Your mobile phone. Spotty cell signal? Wi-Fi calling can help (more below) Google Meet for laptop, mobile app — or via phone (more below) WebEx (laptop or mobile app), which includes a dial-in option A landline speakerphone, available in any enclosed office or meeting space The ins and outs of dialing from Google Meet Dialing goes both ways in Google Meet: You can dial into a scheduled call using the phone number in the calendar invite, or dial out to add participants from the US and Canada. This means you can place a call from your PC any time, similar to softphone. Simply launch Meet and click “Meeting details” in the lower-left corner of your screen. You’ll see “Add someone by phone” — enter their number and press the call button. Can’t see the dial-in number in your smartphone’s native calendar? You’ll have a better experience with the Google Calendar app, available from PwC’s App Store. Help! My cell signal is less than ideal Before each office goes Mobile Only, we assess cellular coverage and upgrade our office networks to support increased reliance on mobile and Wi-Fi technology. But if you hit a dead spot and need a boost, Wi-Fi calling lets you talk and text over Wi-Fi. In a pinch, use one of the other options covered above. What happens when people call my old number? Callers will reach a new automated greeting that includes your mobile number (like this sample greeting). If you opt out, a generic PwC greeting will allow callers to reach reception (your mobile number will not be disclosed). Greetings will remain active through May 2020. Stop by our Mobile Only site for FAQs and a short guide to our modern way of working — or ask a question here. Have general feedback about Mobile Only?

(Photo courtesy of Fortune) Last year Tim Ryan made a commitment that our firm would do more to take on issues of race and inclusion in the workplace -- both inside PwC and in society more broadly. Since then, whether Tim is welcoming new interns, or meeting with CEOs, the topic of diversity is part of the conversation. It's not what he expected when he took on the role of senior partner on July 1, but it's something he's come to believe is critically important. This week Fortune magazine profiles Tim's efforts. He shares the events -- both personal and professional -- that have inspired him to talk openly about race in the workplace and to make this a priority for PwC. Tim says, "The question I keep asking myself is, are we doing all we can do? The actions we’ve taken within our firm are very important, including the new requirement that everyone who is promoted complete our Blindspots training." “That’s a great start, but as I’ve talked to other business leaders, I’ve found that many share the same concerns as we do at PwC. They are concerned that employees feel unable to talk about these important issues at work.” No single organization can solve these issues alone In response, Tim is bringing diversity into his discussions with business leaders across many industries. Last week he discussed race and inclusion at Davos. This week he joined more than 100 business leaders for a conversation on diversity hosted by the New Jersey Business Partners Roundtable. Tim says, “I’m talking with other business leaders because no single organization can solve these issues alone. In the near future I’ll be updating you on our plans to join with others in the business community for greater impact on issues of diversity and inclusion.” Check out Tim's profile, and share it, too.

We can’t emphasize this enough: When the new system goes live (July 17), don’t go it alone! We’ll all have a learning curve and you’ll save yourself valuable time by investing 30 minutes up front. The training is live today -- feel free to dive right in! More to know Clearing your AmEx buffer: On July 9, new AmEx charges shifted to SAP Concur Expense. Any expenses that hit your AmEx buffer after July 9 will be waiting for you in the new system. This may also include charges from the days leading up to July 9, depending on the timing of when vendors submit their charges to AmEx. Important! By July 16, your legacy Mobile Expense buffer must be empty and all expenses submitted. Anything that remains July 17 will be marked as personal. You’ll have to pay AmEx directly and submit as an out-of-pocket expense if a valid firm expense gets marked as personal. (Add a calendar reminder for July 16 to double-check your legacy Mobile Expense.) If you need help with an AmEx reconciliation for charges incurred prior to July 9, submit this form for support. Please note: AmEx reconciliations will not be provided for SAP Concur data. As we move to the new system, we’ll each be responsible for reviewing our own AmEx statements and reconciling payments. Downloading the mobile app: If you previously downloaded the SAP Concur mobile app for travel use, the app will automatically push out an update with all the new expense benefits. Policy compliance: Remember: The new system will put compliance up front to help us all do the right things and protect the firm and our brand.

Here's what you need to do. You must complete a "notification" AFS for C2 GPA clients in the same manner as you would for a restricted entity. This means the "notification" AFS must be completed, and submitted to the Global Relationship Partner ("GRP") listed in CES before you execute the engagement contract and before you begin work ("engaging" with the client). A "notification" AFS is required for all related entities of C2 GPA clients. You will need to search for your client in CES. If your client is not designated as restricted or as a C2 GPA client in CES, you must also be sure to check the GPA list included on the Global Client Portal. Note: You should also check the status of the client’s domestic and global ultimate parent. If the parent is a C2 GPA, you will need to prepare a "notification" AFS for any work performed for it and its subsidiaries and related entities. Although C2 GPA clients are not audit clients, a "notification" AFS is still a control for the Firm so that the GRP listed in CES for C2 GPA clients and related entities is notified of new services (accordingly, the AFS does not need an "approval confirmation" from the GRP listed in CES). Identifying and submitting the appropriate notifications for C2 GPA clients and their related entities requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. Additional information is available in the Channel 2 Guide: Preparing a Channel 2 AFS Request found under the AFS Help - Policy Guidance section in the AFS system. For further information contact any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions.

This simplified way of working will reduce the number of steps and make it faster to file your documents. Ready to get started? Here’s what you need to do: Click here to install the Chrome Extension. Accept and allow all prompts. If you do not see the orange “File to DMS” button after installing the extension, hit F5 or Fn+F5 to refresh the entire Chrome browser tab. Wait for the blue circle to stop spinning, then select an email again and the orange “File to DMS” button should appear. In your PwC Gmail, select one or more emails. Click the orange “File to DMS” button and go straight to the redesigned “File to DMS” window. Once the filing information is filled out and the “Import” button is clicked, the email and/or attachments go immediately into DMS. Have questions or issues?

Below is just a sampling of the new apps PwC’s App Store offers to help you get where you’re going with minimal fuss, muss, wear and/or tear. Don’t forget, we’re looking for the best App4That -- for travel, for work, for productivity, for getting stuff done and making life simpler. It’s all about continuous improvement for Your Tomorrow. Recommend the apps you use, and you could win a new iPhone X. Get ready with Packing Pro If you always forget your charger -- or leave for vacation while your swimsuit stays home -- Packing Pro is for you. It features customizable packing lists for different types of trips, which can be synced and shared with others. With a huge catalog of lists and built-in assistance, you can pack based on your trip’s purpose, length, weather, travel partners, etc. And when you head home, you can make sure all your stuff goes with you! It’s the No. 1 travel app in the US and one of Apple’s "10 Essentials" -- so we purchased Packing Pro to help you travel efficiently. Get to your gate with airline apps and FlightAware For times when you can’t believe your flight’s gate changed again, we bring you FlightAware, an innovative live flight tracker. PwC’s App Store offers Concur, TripIt and apps from every major airline -- but FlightAware can track the real-time status of any commercial flight worldwide. Data includes complete flight details and live maps with NEXRAD radar overlay. You can also enable notifications for departure/arrival info, cancellations, gate changes, delays and diversions. Another gate change? You’re on top of it. Get around with Curb, Lyft, Uber and Waze Curb is the top taxi app in the US, connecting you with 50,000+ drivers in 65 US cities. What makes it special? You can request immediate pickup or schedule up to 24 hours in advance. You can pay with cash or through the app. You can even use the app to pay for rides you hail on the street in some cities. PwC’s App Store also offers Uber and Lyft, oh-so-handy when traveling where taxis are scarce. (Enter your corporate AmEx for easy expensing during work trips.) And if you’re not using Waze to beat the traffic and navigate new cities, you should really get on that. Game-changer. Get a free iPhone X (... maybe!) Submit your favorite app, and you could win an iPhone X or another cool prize. PwC’s App Store is bringing you a better digital experience, while helping you serve clients more effectively.

Don't miss the Reportable Transact Jan. 31 is right around the corner. Don't miss the Reportable Transactions deadline One Firm Risk Organization Jan. 10, 2019 The next material advisor registration deadline is January 31, 2019. If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between October 1, 2018, and December 31, 2018, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including Section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include Section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Generally, the threshold amount for a Section 165 loss is $10 million in a single year for corporations and partnerships with only corporate partners and $2 million for all other partnerships, S corporations, and individuals. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual including via a partnership or S corporations) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

Maria Moats: Q1 update &amp; news you can use -- plus bonus plan details. Oct. 12, 2018 Focusing on the quality of our execution Team, I’m excited about the progress we’ve made in FY19 Q1 and where we’re heading as a practice. We’re clear on our strategy, and we’re moving forward from a position of strength. As we prepare for busy season, let’s continue to focus on driving audit quality and consistent execution. I also wanted to provide an update on our FY19 Performance bonus plan -- how we share the firm’s success and reward your personal impact. Here are some details to know: Your Total Rewards Summary in the Me@PwC app provides target bonus ranges and impact tier distribution, as well as insight into the earnings potential across levels. You will note that the tier distribution helps differentiate bonus decisions, so that people with greater impact receive a higher reward. Note: The Me@PwC app is for US staff only; this app is not available to US partners or interns, residents of Puerto Rico and Mexico, or US staff on international assignment. Funding of the FY19 bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Paying at, above, or below the target bonus ranges will be determined by whether we meet, exceed, or fall short of our goals. Stay focused on your individual goals, which should be aligned to those outlined in the Assurance FY19 Expectations Placemat -- and, remember to go to Employee360 in myMetrics during the year to view your progress toward achieving those goals. The financial reporting profession is important, as Tim Ryan notes in his blog. Below, you’ll find other important updates and news to help us focus on consistent execution. Please take the time to be up to date. As always, I want to hear from you, so if you have feedback, please share it by sending to us_assurance-feedback@pwc.com. Thanks for all you do!

As we move into the second quarter, please focus on timely billing and cash collections, and monitoring WIPs/ETCs on a timely basis. Our One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) is here to help. Here’s what the changes mean for Assurance: Create will be used to generate all engagement letters. Contracting Risk Management Partners (CRMPs) must be consulted for certain proposed modifications to all engagement letters (click here for more information) Specialists are available to assist you on engagement-related questions pertaining to contracting, independence, quality, regulatory compliance, and risk management. Assurance Risk Management changed its name to Assurance Quality Management. There are no new or additional consultation requirements for engagement teams as a result of the creation of OFRO.

As you review the following principles, consider their application in light of the type of tax services you provide and engagements you work on. Proper application of the data security principles will not only reduce the firm's risk of data loss but may also reduce hours in the engagement and hours in your workday. Collect and use only the minimum amount of information necessary for your work If you don't need it, don’t collect it. If the client provides information outside the parameters of your request, return it to the client in a secure manner. Do not add hours to your day and the engagement maintaining data you do not need. Share information with others only as needed Apply the concept of "need to know" and manage access to electronic information (e.g., DMS) in the same manner. Not everyone on the engagement team needs the same level of access. Encrypt all confidential information in external emails and on data storage devices Determine the most secure method to exchange confidential information between PwC and external parties. Encrypt documents sent via email, on USB flash drives, CDs or other data storage devices. Secure information and devices when not in use Protect client information whether in hard copy, or on laptops, mobile devices (i.e., iPhones, iPads, or other cellular devices) or data storage devices. Lock up confidential information and devices when not in active use. Do not leave your computer unattended and in standby mode. Report stolen laptops or mobile devices immediately to US IT. Use only firm managed equipment and email accounts for work related matters Only use personal devices with the firm’s approved secure connectivity software installed to access client and non-public firm information. Do not use home PCs, personal email or instant message accounts, or other nonapproved technologies to access client and non-public firm information. Be aware of how your physical surroundings can put information at risk Secure confidential information by locking file cabinets, promptly picking up printouts or faxes, and by not discussing confidential matters in open spaces. Do not let individuals without proper ID into PwC offices and work spaces. Securely destroy or return information that is no longer needed Do not retain unnecessary information –electronically or in hard copy. Promptly return hard copy files to the Records Center when no longer needed. Return or properly destroy what is not part of your work papers. Retain all information in accordance with firm policies and other requirements. For more information please visit Tax's site Tax Data Security and Confidentiality or contact a member of the Tax team. If you become aware of or suspect a situation where information has or could become lost, please immediately report it to the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS).

This new screen allows BMs to sign-off and process a PV directly to myEngage. EM% toggle: Teams now have the option to calculate the engagement fees based on their desired EM%. Live bookings in TalentLink: All hours sent from EMT to TL are now sent as live bookings overnight, reducing the wait time to get them approved and see them reflected in TL. New TalentLink Upload screen: Users should navigate here in order to submit delta changes from EMT to TL and run reports to review their changes for TL. You now have the ability to upload for multiple Job Names with one click as well as review the changes being sent prior to sending them. View All DT View: On both Budgeting and Monitoring DTs, users have the option to view hours in total for all resources budgeted across DT tabs within a Detail File. They can also drill down each resource to see the breakdown of hours in each DT tab. IMPORTANT: In April we will have additional changes to the Billing and Collections process, including enhancements to the Bill Plan screen. Please refrain from setting up your bill plan in both EMT and myEngage until training is held in early April. In the interim, you should send individual bills through myEngage.

New features released and future roa Using Mapper and Tax Adjustments? New features released and future roadmap! Tax Sept. 28, 2018 You now know the basics of Mapper and Tax Adjustments.These tools aimed at helping you meet your Project 5 Million goals are always evolving. Check out the new features and what's to come for each application. Top Features Released for Mapper Import Wizards for Client Accounts and Trial Balance - You can import using non-standard templates and have the ability to solve for typical formatting issues such as Account Numbers and Descriptions being in the same cell and handling data where reporting units are in columns vs a stacked format. These capabilities should save you additional time and reduce the need to create Alteryx workflows to reformat your data prior to import. Trial Balance Metrics Report - This report allows you to confirm you have the correct starting point (e.g., total current assets, total non-current assets, etc.) within Mapper rather than waiting to review in a downstream application. 1065 Book Return Report - Teams can now view their client information in the form of a 1065 book return. 1120S Book Return Report - Teams can now view their client information in the form of a 1120S book return. Break Even Report - This report shows which reporting units are driving book income vs. book loss. Check out the Mapper Release Notes for more features! What’s next for Mapper? In the spirit of continuous improvement, below are the major features on the Mapper Roadmap: Updated User Interface (UI) - Mapper will have a new UI experience to make it more intuitive to use. While the functionality will remain the same, the look and feel will be updated. Rollover - Mapper will have a rollover experience that allows you to prepare for the next filing season. Mapper to Tax Adjustments Direct Integration - With the push of a button Mapper will be able to send data to Tax Adjustments and also receive mapping changes made in Tax Adjustments. Document Connect - Mapper will be able to interact with DMS allowing users to pull in trial balances from DMS and save Mapped Trial Balances to DMS more efficiently. Top Features Released for Tax Adjustments Book To Tax Workpaper - In addition to the Schedule M-1 report, each pro forma workpaper sets now has a standard book to tax reconciliation workpaper. You are also able to drop in the differences calculated as part of the tax provision and the workpaper will compute the difference between provision and return amounts. Page Level Review Sign Off - You are now able to signoff by role (preparer, 1st Reviewer, 2nd Reviewer, 3rd Reviewer) or indicate it is still “open”(needs review or re-review after changes) on each of the tabs. The tab color changes based on the highest signoff. An “open” status always overrides all review signoffs. Central “Other Section” Data Entry - You can now add or edit data you want in the “Other” section of some or all adjustment workpapers within a workpaper set on one tab (e.g., all 2 ½ month cash payments, tax depreciation, etc). This saves you the time of navigating to each workpaper in a workpaper set, scrolling down to the “other” section and entering the data. Tax Adjustments to OIT Integration - You are now able to utilize a bot to transfer data from the tax adjustment application to Onesource Income Tax. Consolidation Reports - You can create one or more consolidation structures (including sub-consolidations and divisional consolidations). The structures are used to combine the applicable pro forma and eliminations data to generate consolidated review workpapers (1120 Page 1, Sch L, M-1, M-3, 1125-A). Check out the Tax Adjustments Release Notes for more features! What's next for Tax Adjustments? Audit Ready Workpapers - You will be able to export a clean and audit ready report for each workpaper set in PDF as support documentation which can be saved in DMS. Rollover - Tax Adjustments will have a rollover experience that allows teams to prepare for the next filing season. Direct Mapper Integration - You will no longer have to import an excel file from Mapper. You will be able to directly push data from Mapper to Tax Adjustments. You will be able to send Mapping changes from Tax Adjustments back to Mapper. Blank Workpaper Sets - You will be able to create blank workpapers sets and manually drop in financial statement amounts. This feature will be helpful for entities where you do not receive trial balance from clients. 1065 Workpaper sets - Similar to 1120, Tax Adjustments will support 1065 workpaper sets. Mapper &amp; Tax Adjustment Support Resources Support for the application is available through the following channels: Check out the Mapper Forum and Tax Adjustments Forum for FAQs and recent release info. Users can post non-urgent questions in these forums and other users can respond. Make sure to join the group to get all the latest discussions and announcements. Go to the Tax Source pages for Mapper and Tax Adjustments for information on getting started, using the applications, and process improvement guidelines. For immediate assistance, call the Helpdesk at 877-PwC Help. There are dedicated Mapper and Tax Adjustment support agents ready to help. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is Mapper? Mapper leverages Machine Learning to map the Client’s Trial Balance Data to PwC standard taxonomies. What can take weeks in Excel, takes a matter of minutes in Mapper. Using previously supplied and verified training data, Mapper leverages the Account Description, Account Type and Natural Balance from the Client’s Chart of Accounts to present a suggestion on the PwC Standard Taxonomy that best matches the account. If you previously mapped your client’s accounts to tax forms, Mapper includes a utility you can use to convert those mappings to the PwC standard taxonomy. What is Tax Adjustments? Tax Adjustments is an application that significantly streamlines the calculation of 80+ common book/tax adjustments by seamlessly integrating the exported data from Mapper. In a matter of minutes, each entity whose data is imported from Mapper will have an initial calculation of taxable income and what the tax return will look like. Users can then apply manual updates to refine taxable income as well as review and sign off on each workpaper. Tax Adjustments includes reports that allow users to review a “walk across” presentation from book balances all the way to tax form amounts. These are available for form 1120 page 1, cost of goods sold, schedule L, schedule M-1, schedule M-3 and Form 8916-A. All of these can be reviewed prior to exporting the data to your preferred tax software. If you have questions or would like more information, please contact Daniel Mason or Nicholas Dolecki.

Don't miss the Reportable Transac April 30 is right around the corner. Don't miss the Reportable Transactions deadline. One Firm Risk Organization April 4, 2019 The next material advisor registration deadline is April 30, 2019. If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between January 1, 2019 and March 31, 2019, or any previous quarter, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (202-346-5232) or Karen Jones (202-346-5123) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection (including contingent fee engagements), Section 165 loss transactions (including Section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include Section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Generally, the threshold amount for a Section 165 loss is $10 million in a single year for corporations and partnerships with only corporate partners and $2 million for all other partnerships, S corporations, and individuals. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual including via a partnership or S corporations) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transactions Toolkit or contact a Tax Controversy and Reporting Services (TCRS) specialist, such as Ruth Perez (202-346-5181) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions. For any questions please contact a member of the OFRO Tax team. Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/12771.html</url><pwc_title>You Asked...We Answered.

Thank you for all you’re doing to prepare the firm, practice and most importantly yourselves for the future. We’re well into the transformation, our strategy is clear and not changing, and we’re already moving the needle on the way we work. Remember, under Your Tomorrow, P5M, we are leveraging technology to remove hours and create capacity to address the tremendous growth opportunities that exist in the market, and for you personally. Your role is to use that capacity to bring our Cx strategy to life by engaging with clients, to invest in developing your own tax technical and digital skills, and to make time for our Be well, work well habits. Embedding this strategy requires applying a digital element to each engagement and deliverable. Our One Firm strategy is only as effective as the actions we take to bring it to life. Each of you is behind the energy and drive in Tax for P5M. For example, as Digital Lab prepares to go One Firm, we have contributed well over 350 approved automations, a great example of our citizen-led innovation. If you have questions, Project 5 Million on Tax Source is our new home for all content and resources on P5M. The site includes guidance on how to record hours that you have saved through digitization and how to charge time spent on innovation efforts. In other news, read about the Tax partners that have taken on new roles to help our teams execute on our strategy. I’m excited about the possibilities ahead of us -- and hope you are, too. Keep up the good work. Regards, Tax reform Click the roadmap below to learn more about the conversation starters. Check out the latest edition of Inside Tax Policy -- an interview with Roy on questions and challenges surrounding Tax Reform. Update on annual performance bonus program Refer to your Total Rewards Summary in the Me@PwC app, which provides the target bonus ranges and impact tier distribution, as well as insight into the individual earnings potential across staff levels for your specific role. You will note that the tier distribution helps differentiate bonus decisions, so that people with greater impact receive a higher reward. Note: The Me@PwC app is for US staff only; this app is not available to US partners or interns, residents of Puerto Rico and Mexico, or US staff on international assignment. Funding of the bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Our bonus targets assume that Tax meets its financial goals, specifically, achievement of US Revenue Budget of $4.202B and US Contribution Margin Budget of $1.533B. Paying at, above, or below the bonus targets will be determined by whether we meet, exceed, or fall short of our financial goals. Remain focused on achieving your individual goals as outlined in the Goal Setting Placemat. Your differentiators in your Snapshots, combined with your performance metrics compared to your peers, will continue to be the key drivers in determining your impact in CRT. Demonstrating your digitization impact As illustrated in the goal setting placemats, we expect everyone to demonstrate his/her digitization impact and this will be one of the key elements in the Career Roundtable process. Digitization impact can take many forms -- including using a BOT/Alteryx workflow/Tableau visualization or enterprise wide technology, supporting your team in digitizing a process, creating your own automation, or monetizing new digital solutions for clients. Inputs to CRT discussions and decisions will include metrics on the usage of these tools along with the hours saved tracker, as well as your performance differentiators in Snapshots, to assess your digitization impact. So be sure to use the tools, capture your digitization impact story throughout the year (in Snapshots and through the hours-saved tracker), and encourage your team to do the same. Running our business We closed out Q1 on budget with 4% growth over prior year, and we expect to see even higher levels of growth in the second half of FY19 as we continue on our digitization journey. Your focus on our clients and the market is paying off, and your hard work is appreciated. A few things we should all be sure we are focusing on: Billings: We missed our billing goals every month in Q1. We know there are a lot of things you are asked to focus on each and every day -- but, bottom line, if we aren’t getting paid for our hard work, we aren’t running our business successfully. Please renew your commitment to ensuring we get invoices to our clients on a timely basis. Collections is another area where we need to improve. Often, all that’s needed is a simple reminder. A quick call to our client contact to confirm invoice payment is on track is a best practice. Daily Time Compliance: This is an easy area for us all to improve -- right now only 64% of Tax staff are compliant with daily time. Please ensure that you and your teams are in the habit of entering time on a daily basis. Need help? Engagement Margin: Our engagement margin is about 2 ½ points lower than this time last year. As we are removing hours, we should be reducing our cost of delivery and increasing margin. We need to concentrate on the basics around margin; managing our engagements and ensuring we are compensated for the entire value of our effort. Project 5 Million: Curious about our technology resources? Want to find everything you need to know about Project 5 Million? Visit our Project 5 Million Tax Source page. Hours Saved Tracker: Want to get recognized and rewarded for your efforts to digitize engagements? Track any and all time that you have digitized through our Project 5 Million Hours Saved Tracker.

Digital Lab: Digital Lab is going One Firm and will allow everyone to reimagine the possible. Individuals will be able to contribute, consume and co-create automations to make an impact on the firm and digitally upskill others. More to come... Digital Quests: Launching in November, completing these four real-life client scenarios will earn you the Digital Acumen knowledge badge, part of our new Digital Badging program. Our new tech-enabled Real-time recognition tool now has a social recognition activity feed, a mobile app for on-the-go recognition and redemption, enhanced dashboards and analytics for relationship leaders and the ability to provide monetary and non-monetary recognition. Remember, for those of you that have recognition budgets, we are loading budgets twice per year, so additional funds will be available in January. Read more in PwC Inside. Salesforce Since launch, Salesforce has created more visibility into client activity, driven better collaboration and increased our One Firm teaming. In this quarter alone, Tax has created approximately $4.2B new opportunities -- that’s 2% above the average number of opportunities created in the same time period last year!

Helping you report time accurately each day BOT to the rescue! Helping you report time accurately each day Tax Aug. 6, 2018 In the spirit of continuous improvement and simplification, there’s now an easier way to record your daily time. It’s our responsibility as PwC professionals. So, if you are routinely charging large chunks of time to an admin code and then correcting it later in the month, we have a solution that helps you and the firm. It only takes a few minutes and will make a huge difference in our profitability and financial management. Why does it matter? Clients expect that we are recording our time accurately and in a timely fashion. One hour of misplaced or forgotten time might not seem like a big deal, but when thousands of us are off by a few hours, we can lose millions of revenue dollars and the resulting margin. This missing time also negatively affects our ability to manage our engagements and perform real-time forecasting. As a business, we make investment decisions every day based on the data and trends we see. We want the best possible data to make the right choices for our Firm. The exciting news is that we have a BOT to help you!

In a recent article, we encouraged you to continue having meaningful discussions with your clients about seven strategic business issues, including global trade implications. Trade is in the news every day as issues such as the following appear in the headlines: the newly reached United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal (revised NAFTA); the US trade war with China; negotiations with our EU partners; US sanctions related to Iran, Russia and North Korea; and US export controls violations. Not only is trade likely to be the next big disruptive issue, but it is also a huge opportunity for us to bring more value to our clients, who are trying to make sense of the many changes in North American trade policy and the impacts on their business. Many of our clients are pausing on large-scale changes. Even as they are still evaluating the gains from US tax reform, tariffs and trade wars are affecting their cost structures. This is why we should be talking to our clients about both tradeand US tax reform--recognizing this is a different conversation for our audit and non-audit clients. This is a prime opportunity for us to demonstrate our leadership and bring One Firm resources to help our clients understand and address the implications and opportunities. What you can do now We all need to educate ourselves about what this means for our clients. Here are a few things you should do to stay in the know: Invite your clients and attend our US-Mexico-Canada global trade webcast on USMCA (new NAFTA) on Nov. 1 -- and keep an eye out for the next webcast in the Global Trade series. Get to know the Global Trade Services team and learn how to start a discussion about global trade implications.

Connect your activity tracker to get credit for your steps, active minutes and sleep. Set your interests to get personalized daily tips to help you eat healthy, get active, reduce stress, increase focus, be more mindful, sleep well, and more. Program highlights As announced in April, this program will help us focus on well-being and supporting each other in making meaningful changes — and digitizing our firm — all in alignment with Be well, work well. Here are some of the features you’ll find with the new Well-Being Rewards Program along with some more detailed resources. We’re all in this together. Partners can join the program along with staff, so we can support each other and leverage team challenges to make it fun. Increased rewards. You can earn up to $500 in rewards each plan year (July 1-June 30). Lots more ways to earn rewards. Many new activities and behaviors related to sleep, mindfulness, team challenges, financial wellness, personal challenges and more will be eligible for reward points.

The new Well-Being Rewards Program brings a personalized, digital framework to encourage us to sustain healthy behaviors.

The more you do, the more you’ll earn. You’ll maximize the points you can earn by visiting the site each day. Each quarter, you have the opportunity to earn points toward achieving up to four levels and earning rewards. After the quarter is over, your points will reset to zero and you’ll start fresh in the new quarter earning points toward levels and rewards; you’ll keep whatever PulseCash you may have earned during the quarter. Review the program information sheet and FAQs to learn when and how you can earn points. New options for rewards. Similar to the current program, you’ll be able to redeem your points for gift cards or donate them to charity. You’ll also be able to redeem your points for merchandise or even deposit the cash directly into your bank account. Rewards earned under this program are taxable. You’ll receive an activation invitation from Virgin Pulse each Friday over the next month, if you have not activated your account. Well-Being Rewards for activities under the FY18 program Any activities that occur on or before June 30, related to the FY18 Well-Being Rewards Program, will need to be entered and redeemed through the current platform by July 13. If you have a reward balance of $10 or more and do not redeem your rewards by July 13, you will automatically receive a Premier Choice Award via email from Hallmark on July 17. You can redeem it for the same selection of gift card and charity options. Please note, you must have your Premier Choice Award email in order to claim your rewards. The new program is designed to promote engagement so the rewards structure and value assigned to activities will be different. On July 13, the current Well-Being Rewards Program app in PwC’s App Store will be disabled. If you downloaded this app, uninstall it from your iPhone/iPad. How can I get help and support?

PwC’s standard contract provisions are incorporated in the engagement letter templates found on the Engagement Letters Index, which have been approved by Tax Q&amp;RM and OGC. Standard key contract provisions are regularly updated to comply with changes in Firm policy or changes in tax law, regulations and ethical or professional standards. Accordingly, it is important to retrieve the template from the Engagement Letter Index when drafting the engagement contract to ensure you are engaging your client under the most recent terms and conditions. Any modifications to the standard terms and conditions in the engagement letter, including changes to the terms and conditions in a MSA, will require the approval of Q&amp;RM as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process. To obtain Q&amp;RM approval, mark “Yes” to question 2.1 of the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment and answer the questions that follow appropriately, providing commentary and documentation as necessary. Question 2.1 Terms &amp; Conditions Changes · Are you using a previously negotiated Engagement Letter or MSA that contains nonstandard terms (other than for terms expressly allowed at the engagement partner's discretion pursuant to Contract Guidance for Engagement Teams)? · OR Has the Client requested changes to standard Terms &amp; Conditions? · OR Does the client have a separate Confidentiality Agreement that does not conform to PwC Policy? ü Yes o No Each Engagement Letter or SOW issued under a MSA that contains nonstandard and/or changes to terms and conditions will require Q&amp;RM approval on the Tax Engagement Acceptance Assessment as part of the engagement set-up process. Certain provisions in our engagement letters (e.g., Scope of Our Services, Client Responsibilities, etc.) may be modified by engagement teams based on the specific client circumstances without further consultation or Q&amp;RM approval. A good reference for Tax engagement teams is the Engagement Letters: Contract Guidance, which provides guidance for evaluating proposed revisions or exceptions to our standard terms and conditions. It includes guidelines regarding what may be changed, what approvals are required, and provides suggested responses to frequently asked questions. For additional information regarding modifications to engagement letter templates and standard terms and conditions, see the Engagement Terms: Requests for Modifications policy. Contact any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions.

The Engagement Letter and Document Application Tax Q&amp;RM: Check it out! The Engagement Letter and Document Application (ELD) Tax Jan. 12, 2018 Creating an engagement letter is about to get simpler. The Engagement Letter and Document Application (ELD) is a new tool to automate the creation and execution of engagement letters, reducing the risk of non-standard or outdated engagement terms. The ELD is available for engagement teams to create, review and send engagement letters electronically to the PwC Partner or Principal and client for their electronic signatures. The ELD reduces the time engagement teams are spending on contracting and streamlines the review and signature processes. Engagement letters can be easily created and executed within hours of sending to the client. Engagement teams are able to track the status of their engagement letters in one convenient place. The ELD can be accessed via Engagement Center or the ELD stand alone application. Engagement letters created in Engagement Center will be automatically filed in the DMS project folder when fully executed letters are received back from clients. The most popular, general templates are now available for creation in ELD with more on the way for all the practice groups. The templates currently available for use are: · Tax Compliance – Corporate EL · Tax Compliance – Partnership EL · PFS Compliance EL · PTPA Compliance EL · Tax Consulting Services EL · Recurring Services EL with Statement of Work (SOW) · Statement of Work under Recurring Services · Master Limited Partnership EL (restricted to MLP practice) · Coming soon: Transfer Pricing, Corporate Executive Program and Specialized Tax Services (STS) letters The current version of the ELD handles letters where clients accept our standard terms. Upgrades for even more versatility are scheduled and suggestions are welcomed. To learn more, visit the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite on Tax Source for additional information and training videos on how to create engagement letters within Engagement Center and how to upload a custom Statement of Work (SOW) template in ELD. A shorter walk-through video on the review and signature processes is also available for PwC Partners and Principals on the Tax Q&amp;RM Engagement Letters microsite. For further information contact Mike McDermott, or any member of the Tax Quality &amp; Risk Management team with questions.

In order to help engagement teams assess the permissibility of services, the Statements of Permitted Services ("SOPS") and US Independence Policy ("USIP") were drafted. The SOPS and USIP should be used to determine how to apply PwC’s Independence policies regarding non-audit services to be provided to restricted clients and related entities. In general, an Independence analysis utilizing the SOPS and USIP involves an evaluation of the Independence threats that may arise with respect to a particular service offering and related safeguards that, if implemented, may eliminate or reduce such threats to an acceptable level. All SOPS follow a standard format: · Section 1: What this SOPS Covers – describes the services or issues covered in the specific SOPS; · Section 2: Application of Global Independence Policy (“GIP”) – provides guidance on what is/is not permitted and/or what is permitted with safeguards for GIP restricted clients; · Section 3: Nature of the Independence Threat – provides an analysis of the main threats to PwC’s audit Independence that may arise from the services or issues covered by the SOPS; · Section 4: Safeguards – provides guidance as to safeguards that may be applied generally or in specific circumstances to mitigate identified risks to Independence; and · Section 5: Supplemental Guidance for SEC-Restricted Entities – provides guidance for SEC restricted clients that is additional to, or different from, the GIP requirements discussed in Section 2 and which must be followed when providing services to SEC restricted clients. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP provide guidance for SEC and AICPA restricted clients that is additional to, and occasionally different from, the guidance contained in the SOPS. Section 7200 and Section 7400 of USIP should be reviewed in connection with the SOPS and followed when providing services to SEC and/or AICPA restricted clients. The following steps provide high-level guidelines on how to use the SOPS and USIP to perform an Independence analysis: · Action 1: Confirm that you have identified the appropriate SOPS for the proposed services (a user-friendly SOPS chart has been created and can be used as a starting point in any Independence analysis). · Action 2: If providing services to a SEC restricted client, start with Section 5 of the SOPS and Section 7200 of USIP to establish whether the proposed services are permissible per SEC guidelines. If not permissible, you will need to reconsider/restructure the service offering as SEC Independence rules do not permit the implementation of safeguards to eliminate or reduce threats to an acceptable level when providing services to a SEC restricted client. · Action 3: If the services are permissible with respect to a SEC restricted client or if the client is AICPA and/or GIP restricted (only), you must verify that the services are permissible per Section 7400 of USIP (for AICPA restricted clients) and/or Section 2 of the SOPS (for GIP restricted clients). · Action 4: If the services are permissible, determine the nature of the Independence threats as described in Section 3 of the SOPS and the corresponding safeguards to be applied as described in Section 4 of the SOPS. · Action 5: Once the Independence analysis has been documented, engagement teams must include the analysis along with the "Threats and Safeguards Analysis Form" in the "Relevant Policy and Threats and Safeguards" section of the AFS for approval by the CES Responsible Partner (and the AFS SoSRteam, where required). For additional information regarding permissibility, please visit the Independence microsite or contact any member of the One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) team responsible for Tax risk issues with questions.

Not too long after the statement was uploaded, Experienced Tax Associate Travis Mercante took up the challenge. In less than two hours, Travis developed “The Scheduler” bot -- a solution that automates the steps required to draft or send multiple meeting invites at once by simply populating the required data fields in a spreadsheet. Once the information is entered, the bot takes care of the rest -- whether it’s meetings for a predefined time slot or based on the availability of the required attendees, or any other information that is required. With the scheduler bot, Kevin’s team was able to reinvest administrative time into focusing on our clients and driving even greater value -- plus the time savings resulted in higher engagement margin. For example, the team recognized a 1.7% improvement in margin on a fixed-fee $4.9M project for the multi-year Comcast NBCUniversal Sales &amp; Service Transformation from the hours saved. The Scheduler bot solution is currently being used by two teams and is in Digital Lab reviews so it can be scaled even more broadly with other teams soon.

In fact, the team recently had three of the top 10 contributors to Digital Lab —Ben Duva, Corey Merrill and Joe Sousa — and has scaled their learning by coaching other New York Metro-based teams about automated workflows. Applying what the team learned in the Digital Academy, the team also has made a significant impact on their engagements. They have developed automated solutions that have transformed the audit experience for the team and the client. Through collaboration across Core Assurance, Process Assurance and Digital Risk Solutions, they developed automated solutions that combine their knowledge of the client's business with the use of SQL and Python programming to test the interest expense and deposit balance rollforward for the full population of the client's US consumer deposit business, as well as to independently test the reconciliation logic for over 50 key reconciliations. The results are then automatically compared to client-generated results. These initiatives have resulted in over 200 hours of time savings for the team. In addition, the team is also using a workflow they developed to monitor staff availability and reallocate staff resources as needed. The workflow, TalentLink Workflow, takes a TalentLink export, filters for a specific list of jobs, determines the resources assigned to those jobs, summarizes the booked hours for each week and calculates the total available hours for each individual. It is usable on any job and has nearly 1,500 downloads from Digital Lab. “We have truly embedded technology enablement into our team culture,” says Joe Sousa. “Our approach has created efficiencies allowing us to spend more time engaging with the client on value-based insights and focusing on leveraging innovation to enable further audit efficiencies.” Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Malcolm Britton, Gavin Buckley, Spencer Crabtree, Ben Duva, Vinaykumar Jani, Corey Merrill, Brendan McGeown, Erica Silverman and Joe Sousa Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/21756.html</url><pwc_title>Your Tomorrow is here: Our top 7 Town Hall takeaways</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-07-13 20:30:49</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>newsType:Firmwide|source:HQ News</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2017-10-13 09:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>HQ News</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Your Tomorrow is here: Our top 7 Town Hall takeaways Your Tomorrow is here: Our top 7 Town Hall takeaways HQ News Oct. 13, 2017 Our world is evolving, and PwC is evolving with it. As Tim Ryan explained during the firmwide Town Hall, PwC is taking a bold step into the future and responding to what the market (and all of you) are saying. We’ll bring the best of the firm to our clients with more value and a more digital experience, and we’ll build the skills we need to lead and thrive as our world changes faster than ever. This vision for the future has something for everyone -- from artificial intelligence to helping you better manage your energy, to winning some exciting prizes (iPhone X, anyone?). Check out our top takeaways, and the rest of this special edition of PwC Inside, to learn more about the topics that were discussed during the Town Hall. And if you missed any of these exciting topics due to the technical issues we experienced, the replay is ready for viewing. A new day begins with Your Tomorrow. Fresh from the Fall Partner Meetings, Tim shared an update on our FY18 strategy and introduced Your Tomorrow, our bold new effort that will revolutionize the way we work through the use of cutting-edge technology, while giving all of us the opportunity to build the skills we need to move forward into the future. Your Tomorrow is all about our investment in you -- providing you with growth opportunities, developing your digital skills, giving you the tools to maximize your energy and supporting your efforts to make an impact on the world around us. To help tie it all together, beginning today you’ll see this graphic in many of our PwC Inside stories, with the relevant piece of our strategy highlighted. Technology is changing the way we serve our clients. Assurance leader Maria Moats and Tax leader Roy Weathers each provided a glimpse into how Your Tomorrow will accelerate digitization and evolve the client experience -- from crowdsourcing application development within engagement teams in Assurance, to leveraging artificial intelligence to reengineer the way our Tax professionals work. We’re launching tools and benefits designed to make your life easier. The newly launched PwC App Store is now live on the iOS devices (e.g., iPhones, iPads) of our US partners and staff -- and with productivity and convenience apps like ScanBizCards, Packing Pro, FlightAware and the Wall Street Journal, there’s a lot to get to know and love. Got an app we should add to the new store? Submit your suggestion and you could win an iPhone X and other prizes! We’re also introducing a new identity theft protection benefit to help make sure your personal data remains secure. The service is free to all benefits-eligible PwC staff in the US, effective Nov. 1. Well-being is a team sport. Assurance Manager Matt Boncelet shared his team’s experience during the pilot for Be well, work well, which has now been rolled out to the entire firm. Be well, work well provides strategies that boost our energy by fueling our core needs across four dimensions -- mental, emotional, physical and spiritual. Be sure to look for more information in PwC Inside next week on how you can take the Energy Audit to see how you are managing your energy across all four dimensions. You can also download the Habit Bank app through the PwC App Store to get practical tips on how to energize yourself and your teams today. More information will be coming soon on a firmwide challenge to maximize our energy, so stay tuned! Find out what your Digital IQ is (then improve it). Partner Tom Puthiyamadam introduced our new Digital Fitness app, which provides a point-in-time assessment of your Digital IQ, and a personalized development plan to help you increase your score. Advisory Director Joe Harrington talked about the value of technical skills in the market, and provided practical tips on how each of us can begin to enhance our own Digital IQ, which starts by taking the assessment in the Digital Fitness app to understand your areas for development. The app will be rolling out by line of service to the firm starting next week, so watch for more information in PwC Inside -- and remember, it’s available externally and is a great example of PwC’s innovation at work, so don’t forget to share it with your friends, family and clients! You can change the world and build your professional skills at the same time. Tim announced that under our new Skills for Society initiative, we’ll have an impact on the biggest issues of our time so that we can all make a difference, grow and develop, and position ourselves -- and the firm -- for the future. We’ll pilot Skills for Society in FY18, as well as help young people prepare for the jobs of the future through our Access Your Potential commitment. Watch for more information coming soon on how you can weigh in on the societal issues where PwC people can make the greatest impact. We care about each other. From the monster storms that hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, to the earthquake in Mexico and other natural disasters, it’s been an incredibly difficult period for many of our colleagues who are still dealing with the aftermath of these events. When things got tough, our PwC family came through with over $1 million in donations -- which were matched by the firm -- as well as other means of support.

Assurance June 25, 2018 As part of our Your Tomorrow strategy, we’re committed to digitizing and enhancing our tools for a more tech-enabled experience in Assurance -- all to help you work smarter and more efficiently.

Get up-to-date on our new travel and e Headed to a ‘high-dollar' city? Get up-to-date on our new travel and expense reimbursement policies US Finance Dec. 18, 2017 As we announced at last month’s firmwide webcast and in PwC Inside, we’re streamlining and simplifying our travel and expense reimbursement policies to protect the firm and our brand -- so it’s easier for all of us to do the right thing. The new policies take effect Jan. 1, 2018, barring any changes resulting from tax reform. (Please note: These changes apply to US partners and staff; guidance for Mexico and non-US SDCs will come separately.) What’s new since our last update? We’ve released the list of “high-dollar locations” that qualify for the $100 USD per day daily travel meal limit. Other highlights include: Meal expenses: You'll have more flexibility to manage meal expenses when you travel, with daily limits for out-of-town individual travel meals (including lunch and snacks). See below for details. Travel booking: We’ve simplified the travel booking process, so only in-policy options will be displayed in Concur Travel/Voyager (you’ll still have abundant choices for flights, hotels and car rentals). Mobile is coming: We’ll also launch a new, mobile-friendly expense system in spring/summer 2018. Compliance will be built into the front end, to help you prevent issues before they happen. FAQs: Our overview and FAQ documents on the Finance Spark site provide a quick way to get up to speed on the changes. Anything else? We’ve clarified and simplified our policies. Our refreshed documents provide specific guidance on topics such as what hotel expenses are reimbursable, travel for L&amp;D events, giving gifts to clients, and more. Read the policies here to learn more. What do you need to do? Always use the firm-approved Concur Travel/Voyager tool -- it’s cost-effective, and our Security and Travel teams can support you in case of emergency. Continue using the Mobile Expense system to submit expenses until our new system launches in spring/summer 2018 (more details to come next year). Get to know the new travel and expense reimbursement policies; they’ll be effective Jan. 1. Visit this Spark site for the detailed policies, plus an overview and FAQs. Still have questions? Join us Friday, Jan. 12 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ET for our next Q&amp;A session, where representatives from Finance, Travel and Ethics &amp; Compliance will again be on hand to answer your questions right here on Spark. Add a reminder to your Google Calendar (change your availability to “free” when you save).

A summer treat for your favorite cause: How about $10K? Responsible Business Leadership May 31, 2018 When PwCers are passionate about a cause, we go all out to make a difference. We see this every day on our crowdfunding platform, where our values come to life many ways. All year long, our people run fundraising campaigns for everything from child cancer research to veterans support services. Often, these causes are intensely personal, and, through the platform, friends and coworkers show up to support each other. The PwC Charitable Foundation is proud to encourage this dedication with the Flash Fund Fridays program. Since the first crowdfunding promotion in 2015, the Foundation has granted $320,000 to 42 charities supported by PwC people. Now, Flash Fund Fridays are back for the summer! From June 15 through the end of September, the Foundation will flash fund an eligible crowdfunder with a $10,000 grant every other Friday. Eligible crowdfunders will need to be active on the site during the campaign period and have a minimum of 15 PwC donors at the time of selection. If you have a cause or nonprofit you care about, this is a fantastic opportunity to take your support to the next level. Learn more about the promotion here and start yours today. Here’s what some of our past winners had to say about being a Flash Fund Fridays recipient: Shelley Townsend won a grant for Community Charter School Carolinas: “I love being able to help make the staff's lives easier so they can focus more on the children. The grant they received went to helping hire a new teacher assistant, as well as helping to pay for some of the general items that are needed on a daily basis.” Dennis Trunfio, a PwC partner sponsor of PwC's OPEN Circle Network, was excited to win a grant for The Trevor Project: “Abbe Land, executive director and CEO, was thrilled at the news of the grant, saying it ‘will make a difference in our ability to have LGBTQ youth reach out when they feel like no one else cares.’ Everyone at The Trevor Project was ‘speechless, but really happy’ and, in thanking every donor, said ‘know that we will be good stewards of your generosity and that your gifts really do make a difference.’” Wendy Campnell of Greater Chicago supported Okizu: “Okizu (a camp for families affected by pediatric cancer) relies on volunteers and donations to offer its services for free to everyone who attends camp. I am grateful to the PwC Foundation and my coworkers who generously donated money to help these kids and their parents find support and respite in the face of illness.” Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/28036.html</url><pwc_title>Tax training completion requirements in FY18 for associates, seniors &amp; managers</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-30 08:39:23</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>los:TaxTtes|source:Tax</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>Check your Vantage Need to Do Tile for required FY18 courses.

The self-study series is required for Associates, Senior Associates and Managers and should be completed the earlier of 12 months of the courses being posted to your Vantage Need to Do Tile or promotion to the next staff class. Why is this important? The manner in which we provide Tax services is important to our clients, various regulators as well as the market as a whole. In order to meet these commitments, PwC professionals need to have a thorough understanding of the firm’s risk management and quality assurance policies and principles. We also need to be clear on what the expectation is for each of us depending on our staff level. Finally, it is not just the partners’ responsibility to ensure that we deliver a quality work product to our clients and that we provide services in a manner that meets the expectations of our regulators, it is everyone’s responsibility. Completion requirements: The series training should be completed within the timeframe specified. Promotions to the next staff level carry a Q&amp;RM training completion requirement in FY18, similar to the annual CPE requirement. For potential promotes, the courses are due no later than June 30, 2018 – don’t wait, plan ahead to ensure you are compliant!

The scholarship recipients are among the highest-performing of all US high school students as assessed by the prestigious National Merit Scholarship Program. Important reminder for parents of students who took the PSAT in fall 2017 This month, the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) will be notifying high school seniors through their schools if they qualify as a National Merit Semifinalist based on their fall 2017 Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT). Semifinalists will receive an application for further consideration to advance to Finalist standing. If you have a child who is a semifinalist, to be eligible for the PwC Foundation scholarship, it's important they note that their parent/guardian works for PwC in the parental employment section on the application. Winners will be notified by NMSC in March 2019. Questions about this program? Contact us_foundation@pwc.com Meet this year's PwC Foundation National Merit Scholarship recipients Please join us in congratulating the 18 children of PwCers -- a record! -- who qualified for the PwC Foundation's National Merit Scholarship for the 2018/2019 school year. This year’s Foundation scholars reflect the rich diversity of PwC people and offer a view into tomorrow’s workforce as they describe career interests ranging from AI and machine learning to biomolecular engineering and dentistry. Take a look: Julia Guo is majoring in computer science at Columbia University, where she developed an interest in machine learning during a summer study program. “I utilized logistic regression modeling and the R programming language to improve New York City's government-led Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise program,” said Julia, daughter of New York Advisory Manager Yunwei Guo. She is grateful for the Foundation scholarship because it lowers the financial burden of college, “lifting a weight off my parents’ shoulders and consequently mine. As first-generation immigrants from China, my parents have had to make endless sacrifices to give me a comfortable life and allow me to pursue my hopes and dreams through attaining a quality education.” Amanda Denning (center) is majoring in chemical engineering at Northwestern University in Chicago. “The scholarship will be a huge help to me in financing my education and ultimately doing what I want to do in life: Make a positive impact in the world by curing diseases,” said Amanda, daughter of Advisory Partner Brad Denning in Philadelphia. “I have a lot of school in front of me, and this scholarship will help me on my journey.” Jingyi Dai plans to study international relations at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. “This scholarship has decreased my financial burden, allowing me to focus on my education rather than its cost," said Jingyi, daughter of Tax Manager Wenjun Dai in Stamford. "By dedicating my time to studies rather than worrying about money, I will have a strong start to my college experience.” Chelsea Carver is majoring in biology at University of Pittsburgh, where she’s also accepted into the Honors Program and the Guaranteed Admissions Program for the School of Dental Medicine. “I chose this career path after becoming fascinated with the various dental procedures I experienced in my childhood," said Chelsea, daughter of Advisory Partner Thomas Carver in Pittsburgh. "I learned firsthand how dentists help improve their patients’ lives and the communities they serve.” Anmol Parande will major in electrical engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley. For Anmol, son of Chicago Advisory Partner Rajendra Parande, the scholarship “inspires me to continue working hard to build greater initiatives in the future.” Akshaya Venkata (in cap and gown) will major in chemical and biomolecular engineering at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. “This financial recognition gives me the morale boost to pursue my dream of finding a cure for cell-based degenerative diseases,” said Akshaya, daughter of IFS Director Venkata Thiagarajan in Tampa.

One key piece that needs your help is Digital Fitness. As a reminder, our goals are: 90% of us take the Digital Fitness assessment and complete two or more 4 question quizzes. Currently, 57% of us have taken the Digital Fitness assessment and 18% have completed quizzes. So, what can you do to help? Follow these three steps: Download the Digital Fitness app from PwC’s App Store or access the web version of the tool and take the assessment, if you haven’t already. Log in with your PwC GUID and password and the pin DD 55 FF. Complete at least two of the learnings with quizzes in your recommended feed. Each learning asset has been designed to increase your Digital IQ, and each takes about 10-20 minutes with only 4 questions each. (Note: Not all assets have quizzes.) Not sure how to find them? See the screenshots below Spread the word! This is a One Firm challenge, so it’s not enough for each of us to complete our own challenge goals. We need to encourage our team members, friends and colleagues to do their part as well. Make it a point to ask team members if they’ve completed their Digital Fitness assessment, and suggest a course that includes a quiz to a colleague who may find it interesting.

Until a fix is identified, which may not be this filing year, we strongly recommend using a personal laptop to install TurboTax. If you must use your PwC laptop and have issues downloading and installing TurboTax, contact PwC Technology for IT Support (see Questions section for contact options). Note: If you use your PwC laptop, you will likely need to contact PwC IT Support each time there is an update to TurboTax to allow the update to process on your laptop. Watch PwC Inside for additional updates. To help you efficiently prepare your 2018 tax returns, PwC will again offer TurboTax software* at a lower cost compared to many retailers. * For US partners and staff only. Here’s how to get it: Use this special PwC URL to receive the discounted price: http://turbotax.intuit.com/employer/pwc Note: The home screen defaults to the online products. Choose Products &amp; Pricing &gt; CD/download to see options for download products. You have the flexibility to purchase any TurboTax product. Costs vary based on the TurboTax platform (Online vs. Download) and product (Deluxe, Premier, etc.). Once you purchase TurboTax Download software, use this special PwC URL https://tds.pwc.com/elke40/TurboTax/ and choose “States” to select the appropriate state files to download. Note: Due to tax reform, 2018 state files will be posted as TurboTax releases them -- so check back frequently. Bookmark the URLs noted above; you’ll likely need to access the website multiple times. Bonus: The site is available from your home computer as well as your PwC computer. Which version is right for you — Online or Download? The most significant value for those filing multiple federal or state returns is TurboTax Deluxe Download software. At $52.49**, it includes access to free state software. It includes the ability to e-file up to five federal returns (vs. only one federal and state with the Online version). Download is required for partners in order to utilize the K-1 import feature, which will be available by mid-March. Note: Additional fees apply for e-filing state returns ($19.99 per state) with the Download version. E-file fees do not apply to New York state returns, as e-filing is mandatory. However, you can print and mail all other state returns for free. TurboTax Online allows you to prepare and file using your internet browser, while the Download software (also called Desktop) requires that you download software to your computer or purchase the CD to prepare and file your returns. IMPORTANT: If you plan to use the free state software, you must purchase the Download version. What about the free version? If you are preparing one federal return and either no or only one state return, you can consider using the TurboTax Online Free Edition. To use TurboTax Online Free Edition, the following conditions apply: You file Form 1040 with no attached schedules You don't itemize your tax deductions (charitable, medical, taxes, interest, etc.) You have limited interest and dividend income reported on a 1099-INT or 1099-DIV You don't own a home or rental property You didn't sell investments/securities in 2018 You don't own a business or have 1099-MISC income Additionally, you have the option to choose TurboTax Live, which allows you to talk to a CPA in real time (additional fees apply for this service). ** Early discounted pricing subject to increase beginning March 1, 2019.

These entities are now required to file annual Forms 5472, Information Return of a 25% Foreign-Owned U.S. Corporation or a Foreign Corporation Engaged in a U.S. Trade or Business. For purpose of complying with this new obligation, U.S. disregarded entities will have the same taxable year as their sole foreign owner if their foreign owner has a U.S. income tax or information return filing obligation. If the foreign owner does not have a U.S. filing obligation, then the U.S. disregarded entity’s taxable year is the calendar year. Compliance teams may need to discuss this new filing obligation with their clients and assist such clients with this new obligation. Clients may need assistance with: (1) obtaining the required employer identification number ("EIN") necessary for filing the Form 5472; (2) filing a Form 7004 to extend the due date for the Form 5472; and (3) preparing the Form 5472 and a pro forma Form 1120. The IRS recently posted new guidance on its website with respect to filing the Form 7004 to extend the due date for these newly required Forms 5472. That guidance states: A foreign-owned U.S. disregarded entity ("DE") required to file Form 5472 can request an extension of time to file by filing Form 7004, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns. The DE must file Form 7004 by the regular due date of the return. Because the Form 5472 of a DE must be attached to a pro forma Form 1120, the code for Form 1120 should be entered on Form 7004, Part I, line 1. "Foreign-owned U.S. DE" should be written across the top of Form 7004. For further general information, see the Instructions for Form 7004. The DE should send Form 7004 to: Internal Revenue Service 201 West Rivercenter Blvd. PIN Unit, Stop 97 Covington, KY 41011 Or, the DE can fax the form to (855) 887-7737. Caution: For these entities, do not use the regular filing address listed in the Instructions for Form 7004. Failure to comply with these new filing obligations can subject clients to significant penalties. Companies required to file such reports are liable for penalties of at least $10,000 for each Form 5472 that is not timely filed or is filed inaccurately or for failure to maintain the required records. If you have questions regarding this new filing obligation or require assistance relating either to obtaining the EIN or the filing of the Form 7004, please reach out to Andrew Stroot (202) 312-7615 or any other member of the Tax Controversy and Regulatory Services group.

In January, Tim Ryan previewed changes including a simplified market and sector structure, and the redesign of our IFS functions. The changes to our market and sector structure go live on Monday. These changes are one of many ways our firm is changing and simplifying, so we can be more agile and responsive to our clients as their businesses change rapidly. By simplifying our market and sector structure, we’re also freeing up the time of some of our most experienced client service partners to focus on our clients. Our IFS functions are also moving forward with refreshed organizations and new ways of doing things. Here’s a reminder of what’s changing. Markets We’ve reduced the number of markets. Over time we expect these changes will make it easier to work together -- providing new career opportunities for our people and enhancing the quality and value we bring to our clients. As of Monday, your office won’t change, but the market you belong to will change for many. Click here for additional details on our updated markets leaders Sectors Industry developments have reshaped how our clients define themselves. Our new structure positions us to continue to deliver deep and relevant knowledge from across our sectors as our clients drive and adapt to change. Click here for additional details on our updated sectors structure and leaders Lines of service Our clients want and expect us to bring them the line of service capabilities, sector insight and market relationships that they value. To accomplish this, we work closely together across our firm. As we’ve restructured the markets and sectors, we’ve made corresponding changes to some line of service roles. You can find the updated line of service leadership teams through the links below. Assurance leadership Tax leadership Advisory leadership IFS redesign As we reimagine our business for the future, we’ve looked holistically across our IFS functions and service delivery model to make sure we have the right structure, programs, technology and processes in place to support our next phase of growth.

Mitzi Smith: In the words of Will Smith, “We’re going straight to the Wild Wild West.” My family will tour Tombstone, AZ, where we’ll visit historic sites, including the O.K. Corral, and watch entertaining reenactments. Geoffrey Bishop: Three of my colleagues (Munreet Nijjar, Irene Baba and Allison Samson) and I are traveling to the World Cup in Russia. We’re planning to use our Be well bonuses to buy additional swag and enjoy some nice meals while we are there! Lynn Marks: I’m having an eventful “staycation.” On July 4th, I’m running a 5k. Also planning to visit friends and start a major house renovation. Grateful to have the week off to unwind. Whether you’re taking an exotic trip, relaxing at home or giving back in your community, we want to see how you’re spending your break.

Monday is the start of a new chapter in how you access the news, data and resources you need. Introducing HQ and the new myMetrics: What to expect on June 10 When you open your myKcurve links, you will be redirected to the new HQ site. To offer the best experience, we will redirect any users visiting HQ in IE to Chrome. The new myMetrics is just one click away, in the top right corner of the HQ home page. The direct URL to myMetrics will remain the same. News will be regularly refreshed on HQ. You’ll now see personalized news for your LoS, Sector and Office/Location on the HQ home page. You’ll still receive the PwC Inside email on Tuesdays and Fridays. When you click into the new myMetrics, you’ll get high-level views into team performance, business metrics and pertinent job information, pulling data from more PwC systems and platforms than ever before. This is just the first release in an exciting roadmap of features and personalized content we’ll continue to roll out, so stay tuned for more information.

Test UAT R1.4 Tag Driven article - Advisory OR Technology Con Nicole's Test UAT R1.4 Tag Driven article - Advisory OR Technology Consulting (Source) HQ News July 23, 2019 by Nicole Doerrler Later this summer, we’re launching enhancements to the Central Entity Service (CES) and Authorisation for Services (AFS) — our tools to manage restricted clients and authorize services we provide them. Core to our Continuous Improvement efforts, we’re making these tools simpler and more intuitive. Plus, they’ll be mobile-enabled, so you can access them on the go. Before these tools go live, how can you prepare? From August 9 to August 18, there will be intermittent, short-term disruptions to the availability and functionality of AFS, CES, Rapid Engage, Astro and Independence Checkpoint. Explore our AFS/CES guidance for more information on what to do during this period, along with the resources available to you. We’re transitioning to the new systems now to minimize disruptions to you and your team, as August is the slowest time of year for these tools. We’ll share more in the coming weeks in PwC Inside and on HQ. Take the following actions by August 8: Initiate, submit and/or approve AFSs to avoid delays due to system disruptions. This will ensure your ability to serve clients is not impacted while the legacy systems are down to prepare for go-live of the new tools. Please note: If you have an urgent need during the shutdown of AFS, a workaround process will be available here. This process is intended to be accessed for exceptional cases only. Ensure your client hierarchies are up to date. CES will be read-only beginning August 9 through August 18. Pre-clear your personal investments in Independence Checkpoint if you’re planning to make changes to your or your immediate family members’ personal investments. Still have questions? You can refer to our AFS/CES guidance and find more information on the global Spark project page.

Firmwide and  PwC Technolo Nicole's Test UAT R1.4 Tag Driven article - Firmwide and PwC Technology(Source) Tags HQ News July 23, 2019 by Nicole Doerrler Later this summer, we’re launching enhancements to the Central Entity Service (CES) and Authorisation for Services (AFS) — our tools to manage restricted clients and authorize services we provide them. Core to our Continuous Improvement efforts, we’re making these tools simpler and more intuitive. Plus, they’ll be mobile-enabled, so you can access them on the go. Before these tools go live, how can you prepare? From August 9 to August 18, there will be intermittent, short-term disruptions to the availability and functionality of AFS, CES, Rapid Engage, Astro and Independence Checkpoint. Explore our AFS/CES guidance for more information on what to do during this period, along with the resources available to you. We’re transitioning to the new systems now to minimize disruptions to you and your team, as August is the slowest time of year for these tools. We’ll share more in the coming weeks in PwC Inside and on HQ. Take the following actions by August 8: Initiate, submit and/or approve AFSs to avoid delays due to system disruptions. This will ensure your ability to serve clients is not impacted while the legacy systems are down to prepare for go-live of the new tools. Please note: If you have an urgent need during the shutdown of AFS, a workaround process will be available here. This process is intended to be accessed for exceptional cases only. Ensure your client hierarchies are up to date. CES will be read-only beginning August 9 through August 18. Pre-clear your personal investments in Independence Checkpoint if you’re planning to make changes to your or your immediate family members’ personal investments. Still have questions? You can refer to our AFS/CES guidance and find more information on the global Spark project page.

Boston needs you to think of food waste differently PwC Boston needs you to think of food waste differently The PwC Boston Green team is excited to announce a NEW pilot composting program, starting on Monday, July 15th! We’re introducing four new compost bins on the 3rd and 4th floors for a 12-week pilot program this summer. Collection will happen on a daily basis with the food waste recycled off-site and turned into nutrient-rich compost for local farms and schools across Massachusetts. To make this program successful, we need you. If you eat your food on the 3rd and 4th floor in the next 12 weeks, make an effort to collect your food waste in the designated bins; spread the word and invite others to reduce PwC's footprint. You will find the pilot composting bins at the following locations. 3rd floor Main kitchenette near the atrium area In front of training room 03031 In front of training room 03097 4th floor Main kitchenette behind Harborside Market If you have questions, feel free to email US_Boston_WasteRecycling@pwc.com.

We recently connected with 4 Digital Accelerators to get a better sense of their digital journey - reimagining the possible, client impact, and DA advice. Reimagining the possible... Ethan Aronson is a Tax Digital Accelerator from the International Tax practice, who started with the firm in July 2018. After only 7 months with the firm, Ethan picked up a project from the Exempt Organizations Tax Services practice here in Boston (part of WNTS - National practice for PwC). At a high level, the practice manually prepares a high volume of state returns via SuperForms that took up to 40 hours per entity to complete. After an interview and walk through of the current process with the engagement team, Ethan was able to build a bot via UiPath that completes all of these forms in about 30 minutes per entity -- 98% reduction in hours. Due to its impact in the NE, the practice rolled out Ethan’s Bot nationally via Digital Lab and expects to save over 10,000 hours annually. Words of wisdom from Ethan - “Take advantage of the DA community. There is such a broad base of knowledge amongst the DAs and utilizing this group, the internal UiPath and Alteryx forums, and networking at DA events can really help you realize what is possible”. Client Impact… What are clients saying about our Digital focus? Emily Nolte, Advisory Senior Manager, shared that she has been able to have conversations with her clients about how PwC is leveraging automation and how we can help them do the same. Emily added that “It's been really neat to share our journey with clients I have known for years. We are helping them rethink how they can do 'business as usual' through digital solutions”. Insights &amp; DA Advice… Jenn Healey-Anderson, IFS Director in Partner Affairs, offered insight into how the transformation has not only changed how she works but how she feels about the firm. She shared the following - “Make the time for yourself to learn. What you will learn will make your job easier and more efficient. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, but break your task list into smaller tasks and just focus on one at a time. I look at what I have learned this year (Alteryx, Tableau, UiPath, Google App Scripts, SQL) and am simply humbled I have had this amazing year. I cannot thank the firm enough for investing in me the way they have”. Madeline Denoncourt, Assurance Director, added “What surprised me the most is how much the DA program is central to the Firm's Your Tomorrow Strategy and the Firm has gone all in on the investment in its people to digitally upskill in order to transform what we and our clients do." Also...in the spirit of re-imagining the possible we are always open to hearing your feedback and ideas on ways to bring our Your Tomorrow Strategy to life in the Northeast market.

The Pittsburgh office is going Mobile Only! Midwest Market Aug. 12, 2019 As of September 23, 2019, the Pittsburgh office will be a Mobile Only workplace! But that doesn’t mean we won’t have phones anymore. Here’s what you need to know -- and what we all need to do to get ready. What to expect when we go Mobile Only ● As of September 23, 2019 your office landline number will be retired. Callers will reach a general PwC greeting, which states the number is not accepting calls, plus an option to reach the receptionist. ● You’ll use your mobile phone, Google Meet or WebEx. We’ll no longer use Jabber Softphone. ● Phones will be removed from open workstations. However, there will still be plenty of landline phones in the office should you need one. ● Enclosed offices will continue to have landline speaker phones; they will have local generic extensions (similar to a conference room) and can be used for incoming, outgoing and international calls. ● Conference rooms will have speakerphones and our Workplace Collaboration Suite. What do you need to do? ● Spread the word starting now: Update your outgoing office voicemail to inform callers. Start notifying contacts; update external listings. Update your email signature and Spark profile. ● Make sure your mobile device is ready: Record a professional outgoing message for your mobile phone. If you don’t have a PwC mobile phone, order one— nearly all staff are now eligible for our eMobility program. (Be on the lookout for a special code so you can purchase a discounted headset.) ● Connect your mobile phone to PwC’s network via MobileIron. Enable WiFi calling so you can talk and text over PwC WiFi. Our WiFi and cell coverage will be able to meet our needs. ● If you use business cards, plan to update your contact info when you order new cards. If you have any questions, please visit Mobile Only on Spark or contact John Duchnowski. Note: If you have a special circumstance that requires you to retain your office phone number, please complete this exception request form prior to August 16, 2019 to submit your business case. While all requests will be considered by senior leadership, exceptions will be rare.

Each year, the tournament is hosted by a different IBT participant country. This year’s tournament was held in Ljubljana, Slovenia - or as it is referred to by the locals, ‘the jewel of Slovenia’. Arriving in Ljubljana and meeting the team was a strangely familiar moment. Although we talked as a team over the phone every week for the previous 3 months leading up to the tournament, we had never all met in person due to our differing geographical locations. However, due to our comfort with one another, we immediately bonded. The tournament began with an opening ceremony hosted by the Slovenian firm where all of the participating countries gathered for a night of networking and reacquainting. At the ceremony, 3, five team pools were established by random drawing for the following day. Team USA landed in Pool ‘C’ along with Lithuania, Cypress, Poland and Slovenia. The following day on Friday, pool play began. After 4 hard fought games, team USA emerged from pool ‘C’ undefeated and earned the number 1 seed going into the tournament. As any former IBT participant will tell you, team USA is always the antagonist of this tournament. Due to our record of winning in tournament history, we are always the team to beat and as such, everyone roots against us. As we advanced through the tournament beating Poland in round 1, Lithuania in round 2 and Serbia in round 3, we found ourselves in the championship against Italy. After rallying from an 11-point deficit in the first half, team USA emerged victorious, bringing home the gold as the winners of the IBT. Winning the IBT was truly an accomplishment, however the most rewarding experience of the entire trip was the networking and relationships I was able to build in such a short period of time. Not only did the team and coaches from the US firm build lasting connections, but we all established relationships with members of the international firms as well. I have already been able to chat with some of my international colleagues since returning home about everything from potential vacation destinations to international assignments. PwC and the IBT gave me a unique opportunity to expand my global acumen, cultivate meaningful relationships, and shoot a few jumpshots to tie it all together.

The Rochester office is going Mobile Only! Midwest Market June 10, 2019 As of August 19, 2019, the Rochester office will be a Mobile Only workplace! But that doesn’t mean we won’t have phones anymore. Here’s what you need to know -- and what we all need to do to get ready. What to expect when we go Mobile Only As of August 19, 2019, your office landline number will be retired. Callers will reach a general PwC greeting, which states the number is not accepting calls, plus an option to reach the receptionist. You’ll use your mobile phone, Google Meet or WebEx. We’ll no longer use Jabber Softphone. Phones will be removed from open workstations. However, there will still be plenty of landline phones in the office should you need one. Enclosed offices will continue to have landline speaker phones; they will have local generic extensions (similar to a conference room) and can be used for incoming, outgoing and international calls. Conference rooms will have speakerphones and our Workplace Collaboration Suite. What do you need to do? Spread the word starting now: Update your outgoing office voicemail to inform callers. Start notifying contacts; update external listings. Update your email signature and Spark profile. Make sure your mobile device is ready: Record a professional outgoing message for your mobile phone. If you don’t have a PwC mobile phone, order one— nearly all staff are now eligible for our eMobility program. (Be on the lookout for a special gift card code so you can purchase a discounted headset.) Connect your mobile phone to PwC’s network via MobileIron. Enable WiFi calling so you can talk and text over PwC WiFi. Our WiFi and cell coverage will be able to meet our needs. If you use business cards, plan to update your contact info when you order new cards. If you have any questions, please visit Mobile Only on Spark or contact John Duchnowski. Note: If you have a special circumstance that requires you to retain your office phone number, Please complete this exception request form prior to June 28, 2019 to submit your business case. While all requests will be considered by senior leadership, exceptions will be rare.

The building would like us to fill out the following survey. This gives us the opportunity to have an impact on what type of food, caterers, vendors etc in the Cafe. If you have preferences for certain restaurants, different foods, coffee, etc., please let them know by taking this survey. They would find it very helpful and of course being a large tenant in the building probably would bring some "weight" to some of the decisions.

But are you aware of the impact your efforts are already having on our business? Hard work is paying off. In our most recent FeeTV podcast, Tax Pricing Leader Ethan Williams interviews US Tax CFO Michelle Spratt to discuss the financial impact of Smart Pricing: what we’re seeing now, what we hope to see in the future, and what it means to you. In addition to providing valuable tips about how we can maximize the impact of Smart Pricing, Michelle also reflects on the role of the client CFO -- and how we can best address the needs of this type of a stakeholder while framing the value we deliver. Listen to the podcast now to hear Michelle’s perspective on good engagement economics, how Smart Pricing contributes to our growth goals, the exciting functionality in the works for the Smart Pricing Tool... and much more. Want to take the next step? Lead with value: it’s easy to get hung up on talking about our business -- how we’re staffing a project, the solutions we’re using, how the sausage gets made -- but we should be talking to the client about their business -- what’s the value they’re looking for and how we can we articulate our impact. Clearly define the scope: When we articulate the value we’ll deliver and the outcomes we’ll drive for the client, we’re in the best position to tightly define the scope. With a clearly defined scope, it will be easier later on to draw the line, and show the client how additional work should be subject to a change order / additional fee / new scope of work. Use the Smart Pricing Tool: this valuable resources can help us get to an answer on pricing -- in minutes! -- so we can be confident we’re pricing in line with our strategy. Change up how you present MSAs and rate cards: classify staff according to role on the project, not their staff level. For additional guidance, check out this video. Managers and up can learn more about these elements of our Smart Pricing strategy -- and much more -- on our Tax Smart Pricing microsite.

Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” As a Relationship Leader, San-Juan based Director Johnny Garcia always tells his assignees, “Help me help you.” And he means it. “At PwC, our assets are our people. As RLs, our responsibility is to make sure we are developing the best professionals...the more we get it right, the better we are able to represent our brand in the market. If RLs don’t have the right connection points with our people, we are simply not taking care of our assets.” Johnny has been with the firm for 12 years, with the last 9 years in SALT AWM -- and his dedication to the RL role is one of his most powerful contributions to PwC. One of his assignees shares, “Having Johnny as my RL has been a great journey. He is committed to helping me reach my personal and professional goals, and I can always count on him to have a candid conversation about whatever topic I have in mind”. Johnny’s Top 5 Best Practices for Relationship Leaders: Honor your mentors. Think about what your partners and mentors did for you when you were coming up in the firm. Your goal should be to turn around and do the exact same for those that you are leading and developing. Quick sprints. Rather than scheduling large blocks of time only a few times a year, focus on connecting for a few minutes more frequently. Those frequent conversations lead to more real-time coaching and help you feel connected to your assignee(s). Communicate, communicate, communicate. Whether or not you work with your assignees on an account, communication is important. Share information often and openly. It’s a two-way street. Lay out expectations about how you will work with assignees up front, and make sure your assignee feels empowered to tell you what they need from you to be successful. A mile in your own shoes. Don’t forget that you are in the shoes of your assignees when you sit at the table with your RL. You should put the same energy and excitement into your relationships with your own assignees. And what about advice for staff? Johnny says, “Be in the driver's seat of your career and advocate for yourself. Your Relationship Leader is there to help position you for success, identify the opportunity and help you execute the plan - but you are the owner of your career.” Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

She’s lived in three countries (China, New Zealand and the United States), and from an early age her life has been shaped by learning about different cultures and developing relationships with people from a variety of backgrounds. When she started school in New Zealand, she was still learning English. It was a challenging experience, but made easier due to the support she received by others within her community. “To this day, I remember a girl in my class who offered to read story books during lunch time to help me improve my English,” said Cecilia. The process of adapting to new environments, coupled with a sense of belonging and being embraced by the people around her, helped Cecilia develop an appreciation for the impact D&amp;I efforts can have in the lives of others. It’s a thread she’s woven into her life at PwC. Supporting diversity and inclusion within PwC Cecilia is a D&amp;I champion for the Value D&amp;I Initiative, hosting lunch and learns and participating in discussions on topics like gender perceptions and unconscious bias -- and in the process, bringing her passion to her peers within the firm. Cecilia was inspired to get involved in driving Inclusion at the firm last year after attending PwC’s Accelerate program, a three-day leadership development experience for Pan-Asian experienced associates where participants explore how to build strong relationships, communicate effectively and bridge cultural differences. Through the Accelerate program she met and connected with Tax Partner Margie Dhunjishah. They had the opportunity to get to know each other, share their views and practice building cultural dexterity within the firm. Margie continues to serve as a mentor to Cecilia and they have developed their friendship since they met at the conference. “It’s wonderful to see Cecilia’s growth and commitment to supporting D&amp;I efforts,” said Margie, “She’s purposeful in her intent and actions to create awareness with others. She’s living our values.” Check out Tax in 10 and explore diversity and inclusion with Margie Dhunjishah and Cecilia Chen Get more.

Here's how Want to find your edit history in Mapper? Here's how Tax June 11, 2019 Mapper allows users to see the Edit History for an Account Map, including what changed, who made the change, and when the change was made. How can I tell if a team member edited the Account Map? Towards the top of the Account Maps page, from the “Actions” drop down menu, when you select “Account map history,” a modal (similar to a pop up window) will appear. (Refer to the screenshot below). This modal, known as the History for Account Maps, will detail the history of all changes to your account map including the mapping change (what the item was before and after the update), the user that made the change, and the date when the change was made. This listing can also be exported to Excel for your use. See below to gain a quick understanding of what else you should know and can do with your Account Maps: What is an Account Map? The Account Map shows the taxonomies to which each of your client’s accounts are assigned. Mapper uses machine learning to map your client’s Chart of Accounts to PwC standard taxonomies to create your Account Map. Can I edit my Account Map? Yes, you can edit the taxonomy that an account is mapped to by double clicking on the taxonomy. A drop down menu will appear for you to select the taxonomy you need. You can also use type-ahead search by typing all or part of the taxonomy code or any part of the description to narrow the list or find the exact one you want even faster. Can I edit multiple times at once? Yes, the “Bulk Edit” feature, allows you to make edits to multiple items. Upon selecting the “Bulk Edit” button towards the top right of the Account Maps screen, your screen will change to look similar to Excel. Within the “Taxonomy” column, you can double click a cell to select a different taxonomy and use copy/paste shortcuts (ctrl + c and ctrl + v) or drag a cell up or down sequential cells to quickly update multiple items. Within the Preparer &amp; Reviewer Sign Off columns, you can also copy/paste and drag to sign off on multiple items. When you’re done making updates, select the “Exit Bulk Edit” button on the top right of the page. Did you know there are 1,821 users of Mapper across 1,289 engagements? Want to become one of them?

As posted in October, the Tax ESP was under review and on July 1, a revised ESP policy for Tax will go into effect. The revised policy will allow for reimbursement up to $10,000 per calendar year per eligible employee. In addition, pre-approval of total degree program costs will no longer be required. Details to note: Each tuition reimbursement request submitted prior to July 1 will be reviewed for approval. All terms and conditions of the Tax ESP must still be met in order to receive reimbursement. Existing Tax ESP participants will be grandfathered for already approved degree programs. Mexico Staff follow the Mexico ESP and should consult with their Relationship Leader or Talent Consultant on their program details. Associates and Seniors can also take advantage of our Student Loan Paydown program.

Just ask Tyler Whately and Jarrod Mead: As members of the Quantitative Solutions &amp; Technologies group in Tax, they’re reimagining the possible and training others to do the same. The goal: Work smarter, not harder. Training themselves on digital tools like workflows and visualizations helped them analyze large amounts of data to do their tax calculations, and quickly apply the lessons learned to client work. In the end, they streamlined processes and increased productivity. Now they’re helping others to see the potential when you embrace digitization tools. Where’d my paper binder go? Staff and clients need to see the potential of the digital tools and foster an environment where individuals will learn to adapt, automate and create efficiencies. “When I started with the firm, back in 2013, we were still using paper binders,” said Jarrod. “That wasn’t that long ago. Today, I’m helping clients see the value we deliver by using workflows, visualizations and bots in engagements.” Tyler and Jarrod have traditional tax accounting backgrounds, but recognize that how they look at and analyze data has significantly changed. Another benefit they’ve seen from having their teams digitally upskilled is the diversity of ideas brought to the table to solve problems. “We’re getting different perspectives. We need and want that,” said Tyler. Bring on the bots Tyler hosted a training on bot technology to encourage peers to learn the latest technologies and see what’s available on Digital Lab. As part of that training he showed participants how to use the T&amp;E bot: “We take them through something that they would traditionally do through our T&amp;E system and show how using a bot can improve the process,” said Tyler. “It’s all about demystifying the process and helping others to see the possibilities.” Listen to Tyler and Jarrod talk about their “binder-to-bots” journey here!

And how are we scaling automation adoption? With the help of the Tax Automation Center of Enablement (CoE). This team, co-lead by Scott Stein and Scott Skarda, is developing new digital tools to advance our Your Tomorrow - P5M strategic priorities. Two years ago, the Automation CoE started with a team of around 20 people. Today, there are close to 100 people supporting all of Tax. “We scaled the team pretty quickly,” said Kristen, “It was great to have the support of leadership behind us.” And that support has led to some great contributions to the: team’s recent extension automation bot streamlined the prep and printing of over 115 jurisdictions/forms for extensions, saving between 15-20 minutes per form. As a result compliance business units in the partnership and corporate space used this bot to achieve an estimated time savings of 70,000 hours this year. Focusing on high-impact The CoE initially focused on smaller achievements and addressed “low hanging fruit” automations. Many lessons were learned and those early experiences have laid the foundation for the CoE to broaden its focus to even higher-impact automations. “Following a similar approach to our extension bot project, we have a handful of high-impact automations underway, including eFile, Tax Notice Manager, Time Capture Automation and Estimates,” said Scott. In addition to bots, data visualizations and workflows, the Automation CoE is utilizing AI technologies like natural language processing and machine learning with the newer projects. They’re helping business units fill the gaps between the citizen-led work, with the assistance of Digital Accelerators and others on the ground who are promoting automation under enterprise-led initiatives. “We’re constantly focused on results. We’re looking at hours saved and the impact on our people to see what’s the best investment of our time,” said Kristen. Want more? Check out Scott and Kristen on Tax in 10. Listen here.

Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” If you’re looking for a role model who demonstrates the PwC value of “Care,” Chicago International Tax Services (ITS) Manager Angie Unzueta will show you how to go above and beyond. -In November, she led a fundraising effort in her market that raised over $5,000 for the St. Baldrick’s Foundation, focused on childhood cancer research. She also shaved her head to help promote the cause. -When Chicago Partner Ed Bodnam suddenly passed away earlier this year from a heart attack, Partners Barbra Bukovac and Sherry Grabow asked Angie if she’d be interested in helping organize participation in the American Heart Walk taking place in September. Not only is Angie building awareness and managing a team to honor Ed’s memory, but she has also led the group to raise over $13,500 so far. (Interested in joining or supporting the team? Here’s their fundraising page.) -Angie has served as a co-leader for our Latino Inclusion Network (LIN) in Chicago. In the last three years, she has served as the advisor for LIN. “I enjoy coaching — I want to make a difference in our diversity space, help others succeed and contribute to PwC’s inclusive culture” said Angie. “Within LIN, we try to identify what’s important to our diverse staff and the specific challenges they face to then provide them the support to continue succeeding at PwC. People have helped me get to where I am, and I want to do the same by giving back to others.” Angie has been with the firm for seven years in the ITS team, where she started as an intern. “She’s an amazing contributor to our PwC Central Market community,” said Tax Partner Barb Bukovac. “Not only is she interested in helping others through her volunteer efforts, she’s also a really great advocate and coach, especially for our diverse staff.” As for the recognition, Angie says: “I’m flattered! I admire that our Real-time Recognition tool includes ‘Care’ as an area where we provide recognition. It shows PwC truly values caring, and being recognized for that says ‘we value what you’re doing in your community.’” Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

A few weeks ago, a group of our IFS leaders got together in New York with Tim Ryan and dedicated a full day to thinking about how IFS will continue to think big and reimagine the possible. Stay tuned in the coming weeks for more about our IFS FY20 strategy, how we’ll continue to team across IFS and the firm to enhance our client service, and the role you’ll play in making it all happen. A recurring theme in that meeting was recognition that our IFS teams are already an integral part of driving success and transformative change at our firm. I want you to know how proud I am of the role IFS plays in driving our strategy. Our leaders don’t take for granted the value our IFS teams bring at every turn. A few reminders as we near the end of the fiscal year: As part of our commitment to creating an inclusive culture where all of our people feel a sense of belonging and are valued, this year we rolled out new diversity and inclusion learning experiences across PwC. As our next step, I’m pleased to share that our specialists and administrative professionals across the firm will be invited to an Inclusive Leadership and Belonging webcast. Watch your email for more details after the break. As we all prepare for the firmwide shutdown, remember there are still a few more days to meet our FY19 Digital Upskilling goal. If you haven’t already earned your Digital Acumen knowledge badge, please make every effort to complete your four Digital Quests by June 30. You can access them through the Digital Hub. Speaking of the shutdown — have you packed your bags yet? As part of our commitment to Be well, work well, we need to disconnect from work and take care of ourselves. Plan and take your break, snap a photo and share on social media using #pwctakesabreak. Make sure to have your full name on your profile so you can be included in a random drawing — July 16, Aug. 13 and Sept. 10 — for money you can use to make your next break even more fun. The contest runs through August 20 - read the details here. Before I close, I want to share an example of a team that’s gone above and beyond in living our firm values by caring for others. In case you missed it, our Southeast Market Client Strategy team (KINDa_Contagious) was the IFS grand prize winner of the Habit Refresher Challenge. The team fueled their emotional well-being by paying it forward with small acts of kindness. Then they took it a step further by donating the $10,000 award to schoolchildren in need and encouraging others to join them in spreading kindness. If you have a few minutes, check out the recap video the team produced. I hope you find it as inspiring as I did! Enjoy your time off and thank you, again, for all you’re doing to help drive our success.

Please read the PwC Inside article announcing this change and familiarize yourself with the details of this new policy. And, if you haven’t already, start a conversation with your team about putting processes in place for managing data. PwC is moving away from a “keep everything, forever” mindset, and we each have a responsibility to prepare and adapt to our new ways of working. What does this mean for me, in IFS? In IFS, we create a variety of materials that are critical to firm operations. It’s up to each of us, on our teams and as individuals, to think critically about what’s important to keep, what’s not and for how long — and to make educated decisions to ensure that what should be kept is managed appropriately. Guidelines for data retention in IFS: If you haven’t modified a file in 36 months and it lives in your My Drive, it is very unlikely that it falls into the category of “must keep.” Our business changes rapidly and, generally speaking, we should not be using materials that haven’t been refreshed in over three years. Updating a file — as we should be doing periodically — will “reset” the last modified date for the retention period. You do not need to worry about losing files if you are updating them regularly. Many teams in IFS already have established their own appropriate retention periods, processes and systems for storing business critical records. Consult with your team to make sure you’re following established protocols — or work together to create them as necessary. If your team needs help thinking through and creating the right processes to support your data management needs, please reach out to the Chief Data Office and request a team briefing and consultation. Business critical materials should not be housed in your My Drive or email. If it’s not business critical, you can feel comfortable letting things go in the timeframes outlined in the Google data retention policy. The new policy is in place to automate the process for releasing the data we don’t need and was established in line with best practice industry standards for data retention. We all have a responsibility to be active participants in managing the data lifecycle. That means getting comfortable thinking critically about what’s important for us to keep and what’s not — and ensuring we have the right processes in place to support those decisions. * Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold or part of an exception group.

Update: Since this writing, Jessica has taken up charcoal drawing in addition to oil painting. She enjoys exploring her talent using different mediums and subject matter. Her process time has significantly shortened — from two years to just over two months — to complete a piece. Take another look at Jessica’s inspiring story! Artistic endeavors, no matter the medium, can be great fuel for our mental well-being. Jessica Hosmer, a Geo Marketing manager based in Detroit, took her love of art — and a new interest in painting — and ran with it. All the way to a gallery exhibition. Jessica’s oil painting, titled "Together," was featured at Detroit’s Northville Art House this past January. Jessica was one of only a few students chosen to be part of the show. "It was my first oil painting and it took me two years to complete," she said. The painting, which features Jessica's mother and her best friend working together to tie up the back of her wedding dress, was a labor of love, with significance. "The strings represent my husband and me joining together in marriage on our wedding day, and how the support of my mother and best friend were integral to that day," she said. Jessica’s intricate painting process took two years. She had to paint the piece four separate times, on the same canvas, to hit all of the required nuances. "It was a good life lesson in the end; my passion led me to achieve something — even though I did not know where the journey would lead. I learned to be open and trust my instructors to coach me to achieve my ultimate vision," she said. When art permeates life Jessica’s joy of painting has helped her push through hard times and address issues with perfectionism. "Being chosen as a student to show in exhibitions made me realize I was as good as anyone else — and helped me overcome my mental challenges of whether or not I can succeed," she said. She also painted throughout her recent maternity leave. “Staying close to my passion for art allowed me to prioritize self-care during a time of great change in my life,” she said. “As a working mom, I love that I’m able to follow my dreams, both in my career and in my personal life.” Thanks to recommitting to her love of art — she’s already working on her second oil painting — Jessica feels she’s more centered at work. "It's really about choosing to prioritize and nurture your passion, whatever it is,” she said. “When I learn how to overcome a challenge in painting, I liken it to overcoming a hurdle at work. Focusing on my craft helps me restore a sense of calm, which can really help in hectic times.” Who’s inspiring you in a unique way? Help us tell their #TeamPwC story!

Who’s inspiring you in a unique way? Help us tell their #TeamPwC story! Reach out with your “We are IFS” story ideas. Finance’s Controller Operations team loves to volunteer — in fact, they make it a priority. They dedicate a committee on their Staff Advisory Council to finding worthwhile volunteer opportunities for team members to select from throughout the year. “We open it up to anyone in the Tampa office who wants to join us,” explains Senior Manager Alison Heigel. “We take a very organized approach to volunteering and really get excited about it!” Alison is one of five leaders on the team’s Staff Advisory Council Community Committee who select and organize events for the team. With a wide range of volunteer opportunities to choose from, the Controller Operations team sees a high percentage of participation from many people across the organization. “Sometimes we even get competitive,” says Alison. For “Feeding Tampa Bay,” a local food drive, the team wagered a friendly competition to see who could get the most food donations. “We raised three tons of food in just three weeks,” says Alison. “That’s six carloads of food!” Digital upskilling also played a part. “We even found a fun way to promote our efforts by creating a data visualization of our food drive’s impact,” says Alison. Decorating local foster care facilities for the holidays, making crafts and playing basketball with the kids are other ways they make a difference in the community. In keeping with the holiday spirit, the underserved community in Tampa gets to shop each year at “Holiday Lane,” a special store brimming with toys, books, housewares and clothing. What makes it special? “Everything is free!” explains Alison. “PwCers volunteer as personal shoppers, working in shifts over a two-week period, helping our assigned shoppers select their gifts. The shoppers are so appreciative; we really enjoy seeing the impact we make.” Staying environmentally conscious is another driving force for the team. “Our volunteers have collected trash on several beaches, cleaning up after some major holidays,” says Alison. Working out counts, too. “Each year we run a Be well, work well event where participants take an exercise class of some kind, take a percentage of the fee we contribute and donate it to a charity of our choice.” The team also enjoys volunteering at Junior Achievement events, helping students understand the power of finance and budgeting. “Each year we try new things,” says Alison, “We’ve even raised donations for animal shelters. We look for where we can make the most impact.” Giving back to the community goes hand-in-hand with making meaningful connections with colleagues. “These events allow us to expand our horizons within Finance and beyond,” says Alison. “It’s a wonderful boost for relationships and team building. Plus, it’s an important part of helping us feel like a cohesive work family.” Contact: lu.ann.vispoli@pwc.com Below: Tampa office volunteers get ready to participate in a local charity event.

Select customers in select cities have access to 5G and announcements are breaking weekly. How far has 5G come? With what velocity will the rollout continue? PwC’s US 5G Mobile Index is here! PwC’s US telecom industry panel provides its estimate for 5G progress to date and six months into the future. We will update figures periodically as 5G devices become available and more markets come online. Our analysis conducted as of July 1, 2019 finds we are just off the starting block. Less than 1% of the US population has 5G coverage available at their home or business. And less than 0.5% of mobile devices in use are 5G enabled. It is the intersection of these two data points that reflect the US 5G marketplace. The road ahead is a very long one and in many ways more complex than it was for prior mobile generations. As we look out six months to January 1, 2020, we predict 10% of the US population will have access to 5G network coverage and 2% of devices will be 5G enabled. What’s the hold up to adoption? Building a 5G network is different from 4G because of the inherent specifications of the technology. It requires a higher density network that has regulatory, cost and operational challenges, including the installation of hundreds of thousands of small cells across the country. It requires large bands of spectrum that are not currently available. Deploying 5G is immensely costly and at the moment consumers aren’t demanding (or willing to pay much more for it). And, 5G devices aren’t yet widely available. 5G promises to supercharge the connectivity experience, and upend the way we digest media, purchase products and services, and even operate our homes and businesses. But the use cases are far from real and wireless operators have work to do to make 5G pay. Industry collaboration among value chain players is uncomfortable for many and presents yet another impediment to innovation. Why it matters As the 4th Industrial Revolution comes of age, enterprise users of 5G are beginning to question what 5G means for their business. The answer varies -- for some companies, very little, for others, a whole lot. Companies who are taking a customer-led, experience-driven approach to business transformation may find the challenges they face today and the innovation they aspire toward for tomorrow do not depend on 5G, which is a good thing. Because one thing is certain, the tipping point for 5G is a ways out. According to SNS Telecom &amp; IT, around the year 2026, small cell shipments for 4G/LTE shipments start to decline year-over-year, and 5G continues to grow rapidly. And by 2030, it reaches a tipping point when 5G shipments is expected to exceed 4G/LTE small cell shipments*. For wireless operators, 5G presents an opportunity to devise new business models, as well as improve their operating efficiency. There is much work ahead to firmly understand what consumers will want in the future and to design and deploy products that realize 5G use cases with the most potential.

It enriches those who receive it without making poorer those who give it. A smile takes only a moment, but the memory of it can last forever. No one is so rich, or so mighty, that they can get a long without a smile. And no one is so poor that they cannot be made richer by a smile. A smile creates happiness in the home, fosters goodwill in business and is the counter sign of friendship. A smile brings rest to the weary, cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad and is nature’s best cure for trouble Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen for it is of no value to anyone until it is given away. Some people are too tired to give a smile so give them one of yours as no one needs a smile so much as he who has no more of his own to give.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/vn---753-personalized-news-feed---sector-and-los-and-sublos2--.html</url><pwc_title>VN - 753 Personalized News Feed ( Sector and Los and Sublos2 )</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-10-03 04:48:08</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>VN - 753 Personalized News Feed ( Sector and Los and Sublos2 ) VN - 753 Personalized News Feed ( Sector and Los and Sublos2 )</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/vn---421-naveen-test.html</url><pwc_title>VN - 421 Naveen Test</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-10-30 20:03:48</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title>Testing Purpose</pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype></pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav></pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>VN - 421 Naveen Test #PwCProud: Movin’ on up to #6 on People’s ‘Companies That Care’ list We’re #PwCProud to be recognized for demonstrating respect, compassion and concern for our people, our communities and our environment. People magazine recognized PwC in its annual “50 Companies That Care” list, and we’re No. 6 , up from No. 42 last year! To identify Companies That Care, People partnered with Great Place to Work®. Rankings are based on surveys representing over 4.5 million employees’ experiences of how their workplaces have made a difference in their lives and in their communities. Rankings also reflect Great Place to Work's assessment of the generosity of each organization's benefits, philanthropic and community support, with particular focus on activities occurring in the last year. Our continued investment on diversity and inclusion, well-being and Responsible Business Leadership, and Digital Upskilling through Your Tomorrow — reinforced by our purpose and values — underscores our commitment to create a place where everyone is supported and encouraged to become the best version of themselves. Through the survey responses, here’s what was heard: We offer generous benefits and wellness perks. We provide generous leave policies and an innovative phased return-to-work program. We offer an unprescribed number of sick days for eligible staff, to take time off for their own illness or injury. We support our people in times of need. The PwC Charitable Foundation, Inc. makes contributions to our people and their immediate families in times of unexpected financial hardship. It also helps fund charitable organizations where our people volunteer. We listen and build trust. We’ve held hundreds of Inclusive Leadership and Belonging sessions. They are helping us learn what we can do to make the experience for every person at PwC even better. We continue to lead the way on this and are doing our part as individuals and a firm through the CEO Action “I Act On” pledge to personally commit to support inclusion and driving action at PwC and in our communities. We make flexibility and well-being work … every day. We know that flexibility is good for both our people and our business. Our people have the flexibility they need where, when and how they work. And we’re committed to a focus on well-being through Be well, work well, as part of our caring culture. Volunteerism is at the heart of our giving culture. As part of our Responsible Business Leadership strategy, we encourage our people to volunteer for activities that are important to them. We couldn’t have earned this recognition without building an exceptional culture together — one that inspires all of us to deliver our best. We’re excited to see our contributions have an impact, and that we’re making a difference for our clients, our communities and one another.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/QA-Testing/vn-817-newsfeed-test-2.html</url><pwc_title>VN-817 NewsFeed Test 2</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-10-02

concern for our people, our communities and our environment. People magazine recognized PwC in its annual “50 Companies That Care” list, and we’re No. 6 , up from No. 42 last year! To identify Companies That Care, People partnered with Great Place to Work®. Rankings are based on surveys representing over 4.5 million employees’ experiences of how their workplaces have made a difference in their lives and in their communities. Rankings also reflect Great Place to Work's assessment of the generosity of each organization's benefits, philanthropic and community support, with particular focus on activities occurring in the last year. Our continued investment on diversity and inclusion, well-being and Responsible Business Leadership, and Digital Upskilling through Your Tomorrow — reinforced by our purpose and values — underscores our commitment to create a place where everyone is supported and encouraged to become the best version of themselves. Through the survey responses, here’s what was heard: We offer generous benefits and wellness perks. We provide generous leave policies and an innovative phased return-to-work program. We offer an unprescribed number of sick days for eligible staff, to take time off for their own illness or injury. We support our people in times of need. The PwC Charitable Foundation, Inc. makes contributions to our people and their immediate families in times of unexpected financial hardship. It also helps fund charitable organizations where our people volunteer. We listen and build trust. We’ve held hundreds of Inclusive Leadership and Belonging sessions. They are helping us learn what we can do to make the experience for every person at PwC even better. We continue to lead the way on this and are doing our part as individuals and a firm through the CEO Action “I Act On” pledge to personally commit to support inclusion and driving action at PwC and in our communities. We make flexibility and well-being work … every day. We know that flexibility is good for both our people and our business. Our people have the flexibility they need where, when and how they work. And we’re committed to a focus on well-being through Be well, work well, as part of our caring culture. Volunteerism is at the heart of our giving culture. As part of our Responsible Business Leadership strategy, we encourage our people to volunteer for activities that are important to them. We couldn’t have earned this recognition without building an exceptional culture together — one that inspires all of us to deliver our best. We’re excited to see our contributions have an impact, and that we’re making a difference for our clients, our communities and one another.

At PwC, we care about the whole person, which is why we are committed to benefits for our people that support a broad range of family needs. These benefits provide flexibility and enable our team members to be there for their families and be their best at work. Parental Leave Effective July 1, 2018, our parental leave policy includes: Eight weeks of parental leave for both women and men: Note the majority of women will be eligible for 16 weeks including parental leave and maternity disability or adoption leave (see related policies below). Phased return to work option after parental leave: An innovative solution to the transition challenges parents face in coming back to work. Parents have the option to work 60%, at full-time pay, for an additional 4 weeks immediately following a parental leave. The National Leave Center (NLC) and our short-term disability insurance carrier provide comprehensive information about additional time you may be eligible to receive, such as maternity disability leave and unpaid leave. The NLC recommends that you contact them between your fifth and eighth months of pregnancy—or about two months before you expect to go on leave—to complete necessary paperwork. To schedule a leave, please contact the National Leave Center at 1-877-OnLeave(1-877-665-3283) or email National_Leave_Center@us.pwc.com. Parental Leave information Short-Term Disability Typically, if you meet the eligibility criteria, you are eligible to receive approximately eight weeks of fully paid short-term disability benefits (or 10 weeks for a c-section delivery). Please see the formal policy for more information. To schedule a leave, please contact the National Leave Center at 1-877-OnLeave(1-877-665-3283) or email National_Leave_Center@us.pwc.com. Short-Term Disability information Family Caregiver Leave Effective July 1, 2018, eligible PwC staff can request four weeks of paid time off that can be used to care for a spouse, child, or parent, who has a serious health condition, as defined by the Family &amp; Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Please see the formal policy for additional information. To schedule a leave, please contact the National Leave Center at 1-877-OnLeave (1-877-665-3283) or email National_Leave_Center@us.pwc.com. Family Caregiver Leave information Extended Job-Protected Leave information The federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) assures leave time to eligible staff for certain family situations, including caring for a newborn or newly adopted child. Some states have Family Leave Acts (FLAs) that may be more generous—check with the National Leave Center. FMLA allows you up to 12 work weeks of job-protected leave during a 12-month period. For eligible parents who take parental or adoption leave, the firm will provide a single, continuous period of up to 14 weeks of job-protected leave beyond FMLA. Job-protected leave runs concurrently with paid leave and the initial portion of any unpaid leave elected. Contact the National Leave Center at 877-On-Leave (877-665-3283) for eligibility and details. Extended Job-Protected Leave information Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave of absence career roundtable option Leave of absence career roundtable program We're flexible We believe that people are more productive at work when they've got the flexibility to manage their lives outside the office. It can be tough to juggle our personal and professional priorities. It's a long-standing challenge in professional services—and one we continually work to improve at PwC. Workplace flexibility is about working creatively to manage our lives at work and at home. We all need some form of flexibility. Nearly all our people have a degree of give-and-take in their schedules. It could be as casual as shifting a few hours to accommodate a child's doctor appointment, or as formal as a reduced schedule. That flexibility helps us make time for the things that matter most in our lives. We also recognize the need for formal Flexible Work Arrangements. FWAs offer a creative way to provide high-quality service while enjoying additional personal freedom. With the agreement of the client and team, participants can choose from a variety of formal options: Reduced Hours: Working less than a standard week Flextime: Work hours move earlier or later PwC@Home: Working at least 60% of the time at home PwC Offsite: Working less than 60% of the time at home Job-Sharing: Two people fulfill the responsibilities of one position Compressed Work Week: Standard hours compressed into fewer work days Flexibility2 Spark page Practical advice for returning to work Guidelines for maternity leave are pretty straightforward, but it can be a different story for your transition back to work. So many personal factors go into deciding when and how to return to work that it's hard to give broad recommendations. Instead, consider some of these questions: How much paid time off is available to you, including short-term disability, firm-paid parental leave and vacation time? How much unpaid time off is available? How much time off, if any, do you want to take or can you afford? What type of assignments or projects are you working on, and how will they affect your leave? Will your leave take place during your busy season? Do you want to take all your available paid parental leave at once, or take part of it and use the remainder to transition back slowly? Will you request a reduced schedule or other flexible work arrangement? How could you make that work? What day of the week do you want to come back? Would a day other than a Monday be easier for you? Do you plan to nurse your baby? The Nursing Moms' Program can help you decide and manage your nursing. Have you conducted a "trial run" of your childcare before you actually return to work? For example, have the babysitter start a week before you return to work, or drop the baby off at your day care center for a few hours to help him or her get adjusted. Have you arranged emergency backup care in case your regular provider falls though? Some people recommend preparing two backup plans, just to be safe. Pregnancy Planner First trimester Educate yourself on all the firm's benefits and programs for pregnancy and parenthood; visit Resources and Life Events on My Rewards and Benefits. Visit Benefits Express and navigate to "Health and Well-Being." Then see "Resource Materials" for detailed information about medical benefits (including prenatal care programs), short-term disability, FMLA and more. Contact your medical carrier to find out about special benefits and programs. Start planning your leave, but understand it will probably change as you work through your career goals, figure out your finances and weigh all your options. Think about when you'll tell your supervisor. Most people wait until after the first trimester before making their pregnancies public, but your health, comfort level or your health care provider's advice might dictate different timing. It's hard to keep such great news secret. On the other hand, nine months is a long time to have everyone asking how you feel! Let your health, relationships and best judgment be your guide. Second trimester According to experienced moms and dads, now is a good time to begin thinking about childcare options. You might not come to a decision yet, but you may narrow the choices. Also, you can place yourself on waiting lists, since popular daycare centers often have long ones. Start making appointments to visit potential childcare sites. This will help you determine the best type of care—in-home versus center-based—as well as what fits your budget. For this, you'll need to explore all your options. Contact LifeWorks. Not only can they provide referrals and other resources, they also offer confidential counseling to assist in your decisions. If you travel, think about when to cut back—your doctor may instruct you when it's no longer safe. If you plan to nurse your child or want help deciding whether to nurse, register for the Nursing Moms' Program. It's available to all PwC women, as well as the spouses and domestic partners of PwC professionals. Program guidelines recommend enrolling after the fifth month of pregnancy. Can't fit into your clothes? Checkout Perks at Work for possible discounts at maternity stores or websites. The site is updated regularly, so it's worth an occasional visit. Revise your leave plan based on what you now know. Third trimester The National Leave Center (NLC) recommends that you contact them approximately two months before your leave begins. Call 877-ON-LEAVE, and they'll send a comprehensive packet of information about your disability and parental leave benefits, including all the forms you'll need. They'll also provide a leave specialist who can answer questions before and during your leave. Reach out to your local HR representative or Diversity Leader to find out about local resources. There may also be Parenting Circles or Women's Networking Circles that can offer additional support. If you plan to continue nursing when you return to work, ask your local HR representative or Office Services Leader about accessing the Mothers' Room. If a Mothers' Room isn't available, they can help make accommodations for you. Consider the projects, responsibilities and people most likely to be affected by your absence. They'll surely appreciate careful planning on your part. Schedule a meeting with your partner or LOS leader to discuss your intentions, including your ideal return-to-work plan. Now's a good time to discuss the possibility of returning to a flexible work arrangement—perhaps a part-time schedule or telecommuting. Keep working on your plan, and realize that no matter what you think now, you can't actually know how you'll feel until after you have your baby. Send a note to all relevant parties, including the NLC and HR, to inform them of your plan. Include your last scheduled day at work and your anticipated return date. To help manage expectations, you might want to include how often—if at all—you'll be checking in. Keep in mind you should not generally perform work during your leave. If you want, include your contact information (you never know—someone may want to send a gift!). Remember that additional unpaid leave (beyond the job-protected period) requires HR approval, and you need to contact the NLC about any changes to your return-to-work plans. Change your voicemail and email messages to reflect your leave status. Indicate an alternative contact person and number. Don't forget to submit your last time and expense reports, and consider how to handle any recurring expenses. Advise the NLC of any last-minute changes. Childcare isn't child's play If there's one thing working parents agree on, it's that finding quality, affordable childcare is a tough challenge—and there aren't any shortcuts. You have to visit many locations, interview many people, and in the end, go with your gut. Childcare Discounts The firm has arranged discounts with leading childcare organizations across the country. Parents must request the discount and may be required to show a PwC ID or business card. Childcare discounts information Bright Horizons Care Services PwC partners with Bright Horizons to provide our partners and staff with limited access to their national network of emergency backup child care centers as well as free access to Sittercity.com and Years Ahead for a comprehensive database of sitters, pet caregivers, elder care resources, and more. Backup Care Reimbursement FY19 care: For care starting July 1, 2018, Bright Horizons administers the backup care reimbursement program, which provides up to $1,000 annually of reimbursement for backup care when your regular child- or elder-care provider is not available. The PwC Backup Care Reimbursement Program may be used to offset the cost of emergency back-up care provided by an agency, in-home caregiver, friend, relative or neighbor and can be used for child, spouse and adult/elder care when your normal care is not available. Partners and staff scheduled to work a minimum of 20 hours per week are eligible for the program -- full-time partners and staff can receive up to $1,000 in reimbursement per fiscal year (July 1-June 30), reimbursement is pro-rated for part-time partners and staff. In order to receive reimbursement, complete and submit the reimbursement form, which can be found on the Bright Horizons websitehttp://www.careadvantage.com/PwC. Sittercity and Years Ahead Memberships Bright Horizons has partnered with Sittercity and Years Ahead to bring you a comprehensive database of sitters, pet caregivers, elder care resources, and more. Here are a few additional benefits you will receive with additional family support from Bright Horizons: Waived Membership Fee: Bright Horizons will waive the annual membership fee to the Sittercity database Free Background Checks: Every sitter on the database is subject to a basic background check at minimum To register for the waived membership fee, visit https://www.sittercity.com/pwc. Emergency back-up care at Bright Horizons Centers School closed? Sitter on vacation? Travelling for business and need care in another city? Bright Horizons back-up care is available toPwC partners and staff. You can use your back-up care benefit in a Bright Horizons network center, anywhere in the United States. Here is what you will receive: Support for your family with up to 12 annual days of backup child care at subsidized rates. Center-based care is $25/child or $35/family. Reserve care up to 30 days in advance, or even the morning of the day your family needs care. To even better support you and your newest family member, you have an additional 10 days of backup care to use until your baby is 12 months old or during the first full year of adoption. Partners and staff who work a minimum of 20 hours per week are eligible. There is a co-pay of $25 per child per day, or a maximum of $35 per family per day. One use equals one day used by each child. In compliance with the Firm’s tax treatment of fringe benefits, each use of an emergency back-up daycare center will also qualify as $50 of taxable income. This $50 daily value is not an out of pocket co-pay, rather, the $50 will be added to your annual taxable income, which is consistent with the current tax treatment of the Back-up Reimbursement program.

The number of floating holidays that newly hired staff receive depends on their date of hire (see Floating Holiday Entitlement for New Hires below). All offices will be closed on the following days: 07/01/2019 Vacation Day/Floating holiday* 07/02/2019 Vacation Day/Floating holiday* 07/03/2019 Extended firm holiday 07/04/2019 Independence Day 07/05/2019 Extended firm holiday 09/02/2019 Labor Day 11/28/2019 Thanksgiving 11/29/2019 Day after Thanksgiving 12/24/2019 Vacation Day/Floating holiday* 12/25/2019 Christmas Day 12/26/2019 Extended firm holiday 12/27/2019 Extended firm holiday 12/30/2019 Vacation Day/Floating holiday* 12/31/2019 Vacation Day/Floating holiday* 01/01/2020 New Years Day 05/25/2020 Memorial Day Additional information Extended Firm Holidays The firm will provide four extended firm holidays this year. The firm will close for the July 4 holiday from July 1-5. In conjunction with the extended July 4 holiday week, all staff will either use a vacation day or floating holiday on July 1 and July 2, resulting in a full week shutdown. The firm also will close on Dec. 24, 26 and 27. In conjunction with the extended year-end firm shutdown, all staff will use either vacation days or floating holidays on Dec. 24, 30 and 31, resulting in an extended 9-day break from Dec. 24 through Jan. 1, 2020. Note: Scheduled holidays (including extended firm holidays) are non-transferable (i.e., if a scheduled holiday occurs during a leave of absence, you will not be entitled to time off to make up for the scheduled holidays you missed). *Floating holidays This number may vary in some offices due to recognition of local holidays (e.g., Patriot's Day). Floating Holiday Entitlement for New Hires The number of floating holidays that a newly hired staff member is entitled to depends on their date of hire. The table below sets forth the policy for staff members hired after July 1, 2019, indicating the number of floating holidays earned. Date Hired Days Earned 7/1/19-12/31/19 2 1/1/20-3/31/20 1 4/1/20-6/30/20 0 Generally, floating holidays may be taken any time during the fiscal year. However, you should get approval prior to taking a floating holiday to ensure no client or scheduling conflicts exist. Using a floating holiday could be for President’s Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day or religious or ethnic observances. Providing this discretion to partners and staff members underscores the firm’s commitment to well-being and the belief that all our people should have the flexibility to decide what days fit their diverse needs. Floating holidays must be taken prior to June 30 each fiscal year as they do not accrue or roll into subsequent years unless otherwise mandated by state or local law. Individuals who terminate their employment are not paid for unused floating holidays unless otherwise mandated by state or local law. Early Office Closings At the discretion of the Market Managing Partner, offices may close two hours early the day prior to a firm holiday. Using the Lost Time code Use the Lost Time WBS code for early office closing hours in the following circumstances: • You are working in the office, from home or at a client site. • To account for hours of your regular workday that fall within the specified early office closing hours.

(You won’t be charged at this point; you’ll only be charged if you select a plan, proceed to checkout and enter your credit card information to complete your transaction.) 5. Once you have identified the plan you’d like to enroll in, add the plan to your basket. Note that as a first time Gympass user, you’ll receive 7 days for free. After the 7-day trial ends, your monthly membership will begin automatically and your credit card will be charged. If you wish to make any changes prior to your monthly membership charge, you will need to do so within those 7 days. 6. Proceed to checkout and enter your credit card information. You’ll receive a ‘Purchase Complete’ email with details of your Gympass membership plan. * If you are a new hire, it may take 10-14 days before you can register with Gympass due to file transmission timing. Family registration After you complete your Gympass purchase, you can invite your eligible family members to join Gympass from the Gympass app or website. Simply complete their information, and your family member will receive a welcome email from Gympass. Each family member chooses their own membership plan with its own monthly cost, and completes their purchase with a credit card — they do not have to choose the same plan or the same payment option as you. You can select up to five Gympass memberships per family. Family members cannot register for Gympass if the partner or staff member does not join the program. Visiting a gym or studio Once you complete the registration, click the Search or Classes icon and locate a facility. (Note, you do not have to enter your credit card information in order to review the list of classes and gyms.) If you don’t see a gym or studio included in the Gympass network, you can nominate it to the Gympass team, and they will contact that facility and keep you posted. If your gym is added, Gympass will advise you. Gympass will work closely with your nominated facility; however, some facilities may not choose to opt into the Gympass network. Check out the FAQs for nomination details. Support Contact Gympass over the phone (844-478-4744), Live Chat or email. Support is available Monday–Friday, 8 a.m.-8 p.m. ET. To access Live Chat: log into your account, click “contact us” and select chat function. * If you are a new hire, it may take 10-14 days before you can register with Gympass due to file transmission timing.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/rewards-benefits-and-well-being/benefits/my-benefits.html</url><pwc_title>My benefits</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-09-17 08:58:46</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>jobFunction:Human Resources</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description>This page includes access all of the resources around the benefits offered to us at PwC.

Global Citizen hosts festivals with world leaders, business leaders, world renowned musicians and humanitarians to promote social action and engagement. Since 2011, millions of Global Citizens have taken over 19M actions that have helped raise $37.9 billion to date in commitments, set to affect over 2.25 billion lives.

Our PwC team have defined Global Citizen’s Digital Accountability Strategy and automated the management and tracking of government and commerce commitments. PwC has also provided on ground support at Global Citizen Festivals around the world (Mumbai, New York and Hamburg) that have coincided with meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and G20. Last weekend, some of the PwC Global Citizen team supported the Global Citizen Festival in New York Central Park; over 2.1 million actions led to commitments over $7.75 billion, set to affect the lives of 254 million people. Looking forward, PwC will continue to support Global Citizen’s digital transformation and leverage our global reach to help end extreme poverty by 2030! Want to be a Global Citizen?

The team has made an impact at the global client level in this short time as well -- growing the total worldwide engagements. Citizen-led innovation has been at the cornerstone of how this DA team approached their work. Specific examples of the innovation the team developed include: Security Configuration Healthcheck -- A robotic process automation (RPA) tool developed using UiPath to automate a detailed comparison of the security configuration settings on computer servers against a list of technical specifications. This test was typically performed manually in about 50 hours and can now be performed in approximately six hours. System User Access Testing -- A data extraction and analysis tool developed using Alteryx and Tableau to evaluate controls over access to our client's systems, including approval of user access privileges, periodic user revalidations and removal of access privileges for terminated employees. This test was typically performed manually in about 30 hours and can now be performed in just a few minutes. Engagement Status Tracking -- A data extraction, analysis and visualization tool developed using Alteryx and Tableau that extracts data from PwC systems (Connect and Aura) to prepare a detailed status tracker/dashboard to demonstrate engagement progress to both internal PwC engagement leadership and external client personnel. This task typically consumed about 30 hours per SOC engagement and can now be performed in approximately five hours per SOC engagement. Control Activity Comparison/Report Tie-out -- An automation developed in UiPath to compare control activities included in a detailed Risk and Controls Matrix (RCM) test plan to the final attestation report. This task was performed manually, taking about six hours and prone to human error, and now is executed error-free in about one hour. In addition, the DA team is actively looking ahead towards the future - for this current client and across the firm. The team has developed a pipeline of 40+ automation tools that are being deployed across the IBM large portfolio of 50+ SOC reporting engagements, as well as across the Assurance practice more broadly. The larger team intends to share them in the Digital Lab so that they can be applied throughout the broader Assurance practice. The DA team has even organized a two-day session to provide learnings in digital skills that they will instruct this month for approximately 100 core-Assurance/Risk Assurance staff on their engagement team to further encourage their individual digital journeys. The deployment of DAs on this engagement has yielded powerful results in the development of both the engagement team and numerous citizen-led innovations conceived on this project. Through their significant contributions, the DA team has helped place the firm in the enviable position of being the sole source provider of this work -- the client no longer engages a Big 4 peer who also performed similar work for the client in this space.

It was also to honor military service members and veterans. To keep this challenge alive we ask you (and any others you'd like to include) to positively impact veterans by sharing our event on social media. The following are some suggestions when sharing the event: Include the video of our colleagues performing the pushups. (Please upload a copy of the video instead of sharing a link.) Include the hashtag #22PwC4Vets. Include the suicide prevention link: https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/ Challenge others (and possibly their companies) to the pushup challenge. Challenge others to contact a veteran in need and/or volunteer at a related non-profit. (Several vetted organizations are listed below.) Suggested non-profits: My Warrior's Place, DoD Warrior Games, USO, American Legion, VFW, American Victory Ship, and MacDill Air Force Base. No matter how you choose to share the matter, please do something to support veterans throughout your local community. The more we do, the more awareness we bring, and the more we can make an impact.

Laura L’Abbe, a member of a Boston S4S project team, shares how they recently brought their new digital skills to fill gaps for Learning Prep School: After reading about S4S launching Phase I in Boston last year, I was drawn to the project offered with Learning Prep School (LPS) as an opportunity to use and grow my Digital Accelerator skills. I already had a personal connection with LPS after volunteering at the school on a few occasions, and I had a good working history with one of the school’s board members, who is also a PwC partner. And, after reading through the nonprofit’s challenge summary, I thought my background and skills would be of value to the project team. The nonprofit’s need With just under 200 students, LPS serves special needs students in grades three to 12. Their students have complex learning profiles, including dyslexia, expressive/receptive language issues, autism spectrum disorder and social communication disorder. Without LPS, many of these students would be left behind. LPS turned to PwC for support to develop a marketing plan, and recommendations on ways to better use the types of data they collect (or could be collecting). The passion of the LPS administration and staff for these students was clear from the beginning. It was nearly impossible to listen to the LPS team’s powerful anecdotes of student successes and milestones without getting caught up in their joy and excitement about the students’ accomplishments. One of the administrators was even brought to tears as they recounted a particularly emotional story. The PwC S4S team Enter the PwC team – collectively, we represented a variety of work backgrounds, lines of service and staff levels. Many of us had not worked on a marketing plan before, but we leveraged our firm networks to learn what we needed to develop a relevant and achievable plan for LPS. We assessed the school’s competitors, studied their website and made recommendations about ways they could focus on sharing the LPS story. We also used our digital skills to create sample data visualizations and discussed additional ways they might consider using similar techniques going forward. It was incredible to work with my fellow volunteers – learning new skills while making a difference in our community kept our energy level high. The outcome After completing the deliverables for LPS and presenting to their administrative team, they were very appreciative of our results and provided real-time feedback on our work. It was great to hear their reactions, which truly demonstrated how much value they saw in our project. And they are already thinking of ways to implement some of the feedback to contribute to the school’s mission and vision for the way forward. Want to get involved in S4S? Being able to put my skills to work for such an important cause and to see the impact was incredibly meaningful to me. Interested in participating in S4S?

On that day, I received an employment offer from PwC. Also on that day, I should have been driving back to Boston from graduation at Syracuse University after receiving my master’s degree. Instead, was attending my mother’s funeral. I won’t attempt to explain how or why the universe works in mysterious ways. Instead, I want to share how these three things came together in a meaningful way. Skills for Society Fast forward to the fall of 2017 when the firm announced a major initiative called Skills for Society -- a new approach to the way people at the firm would build skills and make an impact in the community. PwC would work with nonprofits on some of the biggest societal challenges and, in addition to solving these important problems, our people would grow and position themselves -- and the firm -- for the future. Boston, where I’m based, happened to be one of the first PwC cities to launch Skills for Society. In September 2018, everyone in our office received an invitation to apply for the program, which included a handful of projects for various nonprofits. I was particularly drawn to one nonprofit, the Easter Seals of Massachusetts, for two reasons. First, it happened to be an organization my mom had been deeply involved with. And second, the organization was seeking people who could help with a major rebranding initiative, including developing a social media strategy. Finally, a chance to put my master’s degree from Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Relations to work! It was a perfect fit. I was fortunate to be selected for the program and assigned the role of project manager. Our team of five PwC professionals and a partner spent approximately 40 hours each, over the span of two months evaluating the nonprofit’s social media channels. We ended the engagement by presenting our plan and offering potential next steps to marketing leaders at the organization. Final thoughts Skills for Society lived up to its promise of building skills and making a positive impact on our community. I had the chance to reach my full potential, apply newly-acquired social media skills and build new project management skills. The experience also allowed me to provide hands-on consulting -- something I otherwise would never have had the opportunity to learn. How can you get involved? It’s easy.

The implementation required that the data for the firm’s more than 55,000 partners and staff, each with as many as 20 levels of security access, had to be validated to ensure that people did not have access to information that they shouldn’t, which could put PwC at risk. To get started, Trevon, Guy and Justin met with the project stakeholders to understand the project requirements. Then they assessed their technology options and chose Alteryx as the best solution since they needed to blend multiple data sources. The next step was to review and cleanse their data sources, which included data from Workday and a mapping file from the HC systems team that identified exemptions. After that, the team blended the data and isolated Mexico and US populations before finally building formulas to create the Alteryx workflow. Ultimately, the team’s workflow saves eight hours every time it runs, or 200 hours per year, and has eliminated over 150 manual steps, helping to eliminate the possibility of human error in each. The workflow, Workday Security Role Audit, can now be found in Digital Lab. While it was created for the HR SSC, the team hopes that PwC groups working with clients that are implementing Workday will realize its value. Trevon, Guy and Justin see more opportunities to standardize and automate their work. “We’d like to continue to leverage our Digital Accelerator training, this time in intelligent process automation,” says Guy. “Building a bot that will pull files directly from Workday and run the Alteryx workflow would save even more time.” Congratulations to the following team members who played a key role in this story: Trevon Adams, Guy Delvecchio and Justin Vandiver Top News</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/news/archive/35096.html</url><pwc_title>Boston staff help 10 local nonprofits identify the root cause of their toughest challenges</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-06-12 19:21:52</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags>source:Boston Office</pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date>2018-11-19 10:30:00</pwc_publication_date><pwc_source>Boston Office</pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Boston staff help 10 local nonprofits identify the root cause of their Boston staff help 10 local nonprofits identify the root cause of their toughest challenges Boston Office Nov. 19, 2018 PwC teams diagnose challenges with local nonprofits and discuss strategic paths forward. On Friday, Nov. 2, more than 40 PwC partners and staff in Boston participated in a ScopeAthon - a Skills for Society half-day skills-based volunteering event with 10 local nonprofit organizations. Skills for Society is a new approach to the way we build skills and make an impact in our communities through Your Tomorrow. In phase one of the program available in five cities, we’re putting our digital and professional capabilities to work with nonprofits on some of the biggest societal challenges we face today, so we can make a difference while continuing to grow and develop. The ScopeAthon event matched three to four PwC professionals with a nonprofit to diagnose a pressing challenge, and build an actionable roadmap to tackle it. Our people were energized to use their professional skills to help nonprofits address areas ranging from customer relationship management to marketing strategy. The day began with a brief training session from Skills for Society collaborator, the Taproot Foundation, on uncovering the root cause of a challenge and identifying a high-impact, feasible solution. Nonprofit teams left the event with clearer paths forward on how to implement a solution on their own or through additional support from Skills for Society. This ScopeAthon provided our people the opportunity to use their skills, expand their networks and make an impact with organizations doing important work in our communities. Here’s what a few participants had to say below. Associate Savhanna Soucy: “The ScopeAthon was an awesome opportunity to step out of client work for half a day to use the skills I've developed at PwC in a new way. Our PwC team was xLoS and xCompetency so our different experiences added a unique perspective to the nonprofit's problem which helped us provide them with holistic software selection criteria, a high level roadmap and a volunteer lifecycle review.” Partner Tara Aliotta: “The [nonprofit was] so impressed with how we collaborated with them and teased out the reason for the pain point as opposed to the result of the pain point. I only feel like we scratched the surface!” How can you get involved? It’s easy. Skills for Society projects are currently available in five cities, including Boston.

Kimberly Frazier (right) shares her team’s findings with DonorsChoose.org’s lead data scientist and other participants. Building relationships. Making an impact. Personal growth and learning. Which motivates you? What if we had a program that drove all three at once? Skills for Society, introduced by Tim Ryan last fall as a key element of Your Tomorrow, does just that. Tampa ESC’s people are helping lead the way by recently completing the first pilot program. Skills for Society creates a pathway to help you: Build your network Help nonprofits address their biggest challenges Develop your digital, professional and leadership skills In the first project, our Tampa ESC team of 250 used Alteryx, Tableau and other data and analytics skills to help DonorsChoose.org, a nonprofit that has funded more than 1 million youth education projects nationwide, better understand its data. The ultimate goal: helping teachers stock their classrooms. For DonorsChoose.org, our team provided valuable insights to help use their limited resources more effectively. And on our side, the accomplishments included helping our people learn a new technology platform, develop their digital skills and work with new colleagues. Here’s what a few participants had to say about the experience: Director Mitzi Minor: "This was an exciting, win-win project to be a part of, as it allowed us to help a nonprofit in need while enhancing our digital aptitude. My mom and sister-in-law are both public school teachers, so I've seen firsthand how educators struggle to equip their classrooms with the supplies they need. I was thrilled to learn that PwC was connecting us with DonorsChoose.org, knowing we were contributing to an organization that funds classrooms (and benefits teachers like my mom and sister-in-law) made my efforts even more rewarding and meaningful!" Manager Marjorie Schmit: “Being part of Skills for Society was such an enriching opportunity to learn new skills, build relationships and give back to the community! I was impressed with the level of collaboration of my team where each team member shared their respective skills as we built our Alteryx workflows and Tableau reports. I was most amazed by the interest from DonorsChoose.org in our recommendations for improvements to their teacher request experience.” Senior Associate Luanne Thorpe: “I had previously downloaded Alteryx and watched self-study training, so having a real-world data set to work with has shortened my learning curve. This has allowed me to incorporate these new skills in my work.” What’s next for Skills for Society? Skills for Society is currently in phase one and will launch more projects soon. Stay tuned as more projects become available.

With the help of influential actresses and business leaders, the “Me Too” phrase has turned into a movement, spurring conversations over sexual harassment and encouraging both women and men to speak up. In an effort to have an open dialogue on sexual harassment and the policies and procedures put in place at PwC, individuals from our diversity and inclusion team as well as our ethics and business conduct team are teaming up to hold a “Candid Conversation about Respect in the Workplace” in offices across the United States – reaching over 40 offices in the past year. On April 26, 2019 the GP2W Speaker Series Committee invited Chris Brassell, Inclusion and Diversity Director, and Steve Kessler, Ethics and Business Conduct Director, to the Cincinnati office to hold an open conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace. With over 3o people in attendance, Chris and Steve’s presentation quickly turned into an open dialogue between colleagues. People asked tough questions, shared their thoughts and opinions, and some spoke from a place of personal experience. Finding the courage to speak up about sexual harassment can be a tough ask, however, PwC is continually striving to foster an environment that encourages people to speak up and speak out against sexual harassment. Having continual open dialogues over the topic of sexual harassment is just one of many steps in cultivating an inclusive work environment, albeit an important one.

Five questions. Five answers. Five minutes (or less). And a chance to get to know an IFS colleague and the unique value they bring to PwC. 1. Name, rank, serial number? I'm Seery Maggio, a director in National Real Estate Operations based out of the Denver office. I've been with the firm since 2009. 2. What’s a typical day like for you? I travel often; I'm currently involved in the renovation of our headquarters in Mexico. When there, I typically meet with real estate colleagues -- as well as IT, office services and others -- for all-day work sessions where we handle planning, problem solving and leveraging new technologies impacting the renovation. I manage communications to keep our people apprised of renovation timelines and how they may be affected; it helps that I’m fluent in Spanish! Our team leads all aspects of real estate operations, from renovations to opening new sites. Over the past few years we've opened over 30 new PwC offices worldwide. 3. How did your journey lead you to this role? When I first joined the firm I facilitated Oracle implementations in what was then called Advisory People &amp; Change. I then helped build a new client-facing change methodology, formerly known as Transform, which included preparing templates and tool kits, as well as teaching training sessions. I later joined National Real Estate, led by Willem VanDooijeweert, where I am today, leading and delivering strategic change for both PwC and our clients. 4. How does your team bring value to PwC? National Real Estate is one of the few teams in IFS that does external client work. In addition to firm real estate operations, we help clients with Workforce of the Future and Fit For Growth opportunities, partnering with other client teams. Externally, we participate in client workshops, helping clients think through the people impacts and all other aspects of potential headquarters moves. This includes education and messaging around the physical move itself, as well as the overall employee experience, workplace technology and the real estate required to attract and retain the future talent of the business. I'm proud of our team; we keep respect and collaboration at the forefront and sincerely want to see each other succeed. We also embrace flexibility; we are located throughout the country and enjoy leveraging new technology to connect. 5. What would people be surprised to know about you? During the summer, my dog Coco and I volunteer at Craig Hospital in Denver, a facility that focuses on helping those with brain and spinal injuries. Pet therapy is very rewarding; we love bringing the patients and their families as much joy as possible during these therapeutic visits. In addition to my commitment to pet therapy, I also have an obsession with antiques. I adore antiquing and going to estate sales. From rugs to furniture to artwork to chandeliers -- I'm a super fan of anything with a history! Do you have a colleague or team that's delivering value to #TeamPwC in a unique way? Help us tell their story! Reach out with your Take 5 nominations.

In 2018, UPS launched a bold initiative called the One Procurement Transformation. This initiative was tasked with delivering $1B in benefits by 2021 and developing global world-class procurement capabilities across UPS. The ability to rapidly deploy S2P (Source to Pay) globally to address $21B in spend and support 70 thousand users worldwide is a critical enabler. What was our solution for UPS? We worked closely with the UPS Procurement Leadership team to develop a roadmap to successfully deploy S2P globally. The initiative was mobilized with our Source to Pay (S2P) Integrated Solution, and the best of both management and technology consulting to provide UPS with an end-to-end solution. We continued to build momentum with them by developing the future operating model, updating procurement policies, driving the S2P tool selection RFP, and developing a self-funding roadmap to deploy S2P globally in a measured, accelerated manner. We leveraged the Source to Pay integrated solution playbook to show UPS how we will solve the challenge of working on detailed design, operating model development, process redesign, tool selection, implementation, and deployment. UPS could clearly see the journey they were about to take and felt confident in our ability to deliver. Additionally, a set of tools from our Fit for Growth (FFG) toolkit demonstrated to UPS that we will deliver in a unique, more efficient manner. What results will UPS see using our solution? $1B in ROI benefits by 2021. Additional $260M from process, compliance and tool related improvements, providing a strong ROI on the effort and making it self-funded. Increase in purchasing compliance, reduction in the audit risk, and establishing a best-in-class procurement organization. What was significant about this win, what does it mean for us? A potential to achieve a 38% margin. Use case scenarios of utilizing Your Tomorrow digital assets at a client engagement. Demonstration of our Fit for Growth Platform value proposition - helping clients create an environment for change to happen and culture to evolve as they prepare for a faster moving and unpredictable future. Winning proposition in the market that can be applied to any client. Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell.

Who’s inspiring you in a unique way? Help us tell their #TeamPwC story! Reach out with your “We are IFS” story ideas. Laphil Bowles, a Finance manager in the Tampa office, understands the importance of getting a head start. As a student, she participated in the Academy of Finance, a national program sponsored by the nonprofit National Academy Foundation, that prepares high school students for college and a career in finance. “It was a life changer for me,” Laphil says. “A career in accounting never sparked my interest simply because of the unknown -- but the Academy quickly changed that. I credit them with expanding my career opportunities and paving the way to my future passion!” Laphil’s experience with the Academy of Finance ignited a successful career path and a commitment to opening up similar opportunities for students who, like her, might not otherwise consider a future in finance. Laphil serves on the Hillsborough County Academy of Finance Advisory Board, letting her shine as a true champion for the students. Her enthusiasm for the program has been contagious! Laphil coordinates PwC Tampa colleagues who volunteer to help students foster leadership skills, facilitate mock job interviews and judge competitions -- local students compete up to the national level. “PwCers are beacons for these students,” says Laphil. “It’s gratifying to see so many of my teammates embracing this commitment to building a solid future for our youth.” The program itself is rigorous. On top of the students’ normal curriculum, the Academy of Finance offers students a variety of opportunities to network with local business professionals to develop leadership skills. “They can earn college credits and honor points toward their GPA, and the experience often leads to scholarships and internships,” explains Laphil. “We love giving tours of the Tampa office and giving students a glimpse of what a career at PwC could look like. Our people help these students see exciting options for their future.” The Academy of Finance is also aligned with PwC’s Access Your Potential, our commitment to equipping diverse students with the skills they need to succeed in the future. “Today’s high school students need an advocate, someone to model a path for the future and help lay the groundwork for them to get there,” says Laphil. “I know the importance of this program first hand and I’m so proud that PwC sees the value in caring for the future of both our local students and our profession.” PwC volunteers gather to judge an Academy of Finance student competition.

This automation saves time and reduces error risk How ‘bot that? This automation saves time and reduces error risk HQ News April 12, 2019 Reducing repetitive tasks and the risk of human error would be a win for any team. On a recent engagement, the Deals - Capital Markets and Accounting Advisory Services (CMAAS) practice’s Project Greyhound team did just that! While working with a non-audit Blackstone (global priority account)-sponsored portfolio client in connection with its planned initial public offering (IPO), the team found that the client was manually updating over 250 disclosures every time a valuation assumption changed. The team used their newly acquired digital skills to help their client automate the process. They were initially working with the client’s semi-structured data in Excel that was not machine readable, so the first step to automating the process was to structure the data. To do this, they brought the client’s data into Google Sheets and structured it into a flat file by creating a flat tracker next to the disclosures on a number of worksheets throughout the workbook. Once the data was in a machine-readable format, the team, led by Digital Accelerator Anthony Sabatino, built a bot using UiPath Studio that automatically transcribed the data from the Google Sheet into a PDF. The bot, which took about 10 hours to build, took a process that would have normally taken two to three hours manually and shortened it to less than five minutes. The process is typically repeated eight to 10 times on a planned IPO offering resulting in a time savings of 16 to 30 hours. Using the bot also significantly reduces the risk of human error from copying data from one place to another. “Our success can definitely be attributed to the tremendous support we received from the account and firm leadership and our team’s willingness to try something new,” Anthony said. “Everyone is fascinated with the endless possibilities these digital tools provide.” The team’s client and other working party members (counsel, private equity sponsor and underwriters) were very happy with the outcome.

One of our most popular learning channels has been PowerUp!. Since launching in September, over 23,000 of us have tuned in. Friday, June 14’s game will be the FY19 season finale and then we’ll PowerDown … for now.

Any subsequent winnings from the June 11 and 14 games will be automatically paid out via payroll. Don’t miss our last few games! Our esteemed hosts, Christine and Erin, have some big surprises planned before they snap their fingers and we start the wait for what’s in store for FY20. FOMO? You still have a few weeks to play! If you haven’t already, download the PowerUp! app on your mobile device (iOS or Android) and tune in every Tuesday and Friday at 2 p.m. ET until June 14.

The network consists of more than 2,000 professionals and shares one vision: to be the leading advisor to clients facing moments of exceptional change in a digital world. Our goal as a global CMAAS business is to drive growth across the network at a rate of more than 15% per year, growing our revenue to $2B by 2023. The network is led by a global leadership team (GLT) comprised of seven territory leaders who have been tasked to develop the strategy and objectives to meet our goal. FY19 Objectives Last month, the GLT, along with other CMAAS leaders from around the world, met in London to discuss the global CMAAS vision. Our FY19 objectives center around five initiatives: being market focused, branding, deals alignment, disruption and upskilling our people. These objectives align with the US strategy and cover all aspects of our business. What’s Next The territories have been asked to focus on four key strategic solutions: Capital Raising, Divestitures, Acquisitions and Accounting Change (including Leases, Insurance and Finance of the Future). In the US, we are delivering on these solutions and are well positioned to contribute to global efforts. We’ll begin sharing our knowledge and experience with teams across the network via Kate Dahlberg on Divestitures, Emily Kirsch on Acquisitions and Nicole Yuan broadly on Disruption/Technology. Keep checking your myKcurve newsfeed for global CMAAS updates and the latest developments on how we're achieving our FY19 objectives.

The next step on our multi-year journey in how we use data is putting in place guidance to help us all become active participants in managing the data lifecycle. So, on Nov. 1, 2019, we’ll implement a new Google data retention policy and apply retention periods to our active email system (Google Mail), our retiring email system (Lotus Notes) and other non-record data (including the entire G Suite). This is a change for G Suite but does not impact our existing records retention policies and requirements, which should continue to be top of mind as we make this transition. What to expect Beginning Nov. 1, 2019, our policy will be to*: Automatically delete emails (both Google Mail and Lotus Notes) that are older than 18 months. (So on Nov. 1, your mailbox will only have emails dated after May 1, 2018.) Automatically delete files in Google My Drive which have a “last modified” date older than 36 months. *Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold. Read more on what that means and check to see if you are subject to an OGC Legal Hold. Automated deletion is also coming for other Google apps — similar to how Google Mail trash, Google Chat (direct and group messages) and Chat Rooms are automatically deleted today. For the Tax practice, there will be a Tax-specific approach to the document retention process. Additional guidance and protocols will be shared separately in the near term. Additionally, the Chief Data Office is working with key functions to ensure processes and functionality are in place to manage retention requirements. What do I need to do to prepare? We all have a responsibility to be active participants in managing the data lifecycle. A “keep everything forever” mindset creates risk and quickly leads to unmanageable volumes of data. Get comfortable thinking critically about what’s important for us to keep and what’s not — and ensure that what should be kept is moved to our systems of record. Confirm you are following existing guidance on appropriate collaboration tools for sharing files and for retaining records and storing non-record data. Any client or project information — including email — that needs to be retained must be stored in the appropriate record repository and/or approved collaboration space for that client. Visit the Data Remediation@PwC page for helpful resources, including information on what’s important for us to keep (record data), and what’s not (non-record data). But wait … I’ve got important stuff in Google Mail and My Drive! We’ve outlined these steps to help you appropriately retain any information in G Suite that holds business value (check here for help with doing the same in Lotus Notes). More to know The way we approach data as a firm is changing. As part of a multi-year data journey, we’ve implemented robust, modern systems for retaining and managing records and for collaboration. At the same time, we’re retiring outdated data storage systems; deleting redundant, obsolete and trivial data; and implementing guidance for actively managing the data lifecycle.

As I look through this list of 92 leaders, it’s bittersweet for me. I’m so grateful for all their contributions and happy for them as they begin this exciting new phase. But, I will miss them. They have been friends and people I am proud to call my partners. I know that the people on this list have been important to you as well, either individually — as a mentor, advisor, or simply a friendly face in the hallway — or collectively, as builders of a firm where you have developed professionally and had exciting opportunities. As they prepare to enjoy this next phase of life, let’s send our retiring partners off with our deepest thanks, and spend time to learn from them so we can sustain and build on all they’ve accomplished.

New devices and digital banking tools give consumers the convenience of banking on the go, but the traditional banking center still has plenty of fans for certain kinds of transactions.

When I saw that there was an opportunity through Skills for Society to put my professional skills to work to help an organization called iMentor more effectively support first-generation students from low-income communities working hard to graduate high school, succeed in college and achieve their ambitions, I knew I had to be part of it. While iMentor has a strong mentor network (which includes many PwCers, since it is part of our Access Your Potential initiative), to scale their impact and the organization’s footprint, they need to evolve the experience in order to recruit additional high-quality mentors. A One Firm team of nine PwCers in Chicago, myself included, came together to help iMentor think through their strategy. We analyzed their data to understand correlations, find trends and provide strategic recommendations to improve the mentor experience. Collaborating and upskilling While I expected to be challenged and learn a lot from this project, an unexpected benefit was building new relationships with colleagues I wouldn’t have normally crossed paths with. We each brought something different to the table. I provided my project management skills, while others shared Tableau skills — which I was thrilled to learn from them! One teammate even went as far as to guide me through the deliverable creation process after finding out I didn’t have much experience delivering data-driven findings in PowerPoint. It’s only been a few weeks since we concluded the project and iMentor is already using the Tableau dashboards our team helped create to improve their data tracking quality. We also provided them with strategic recommendations to enhance the mentor experience, including strengthening the peer mentor network and providing mentors with resources to better assist their mentees with the college admissions process. Being part of this project gave me a chance to challenge myself in new ways and it was incredibly rewarding to know that the recommendations we gave the organization would help students change the course of their lives. One of our main contacts at the organization summed up our impact by stating: “Thanks so much for ALL you did on this project. We are grateful and will be using the recommendations, insights and data as we map Mentor Experience priorities and strategies in 2019 and beyond!” How can you get involved? It’s easy.

For almost 20 years, Let’s Get Ready has provided high school students from underserved communities and first-generation-to-college students with free SAT preparation, admissions counseling and other support services needed to enter and graduate from college. While Let’s Get Ready has mastered its delivery of SAT prep programs to underprivileged students, in order to grow, the organization needs to be more effective at capital campaign fundraising and raising awareness of it’s coaching and mentoring programs to attract more participants and donors — and that’s where Skills for Society came in. As Managers in Tax with MBAs, experience managing a team, and knowledge of business marketing concepts, creating Let’s Get Ready’s new marketing strategy was well aligned with our background and expertise. We were excited to share our skills and volunteer our time with the organization. To create the marketing strategy, we interviewed Let’s Get Ready’s key stakeholders and compared the organization’s current online presence and social media platforms to its peers. We discussed with Let’s Get Ready potential technology platforms and add-on capabilities the organization could use to fully optimize the use of technology and enhance its marketing initiatives so donors and students could login, donate, check resources, ask questions and further engage with Let’s Get Ready online. We also shared techniques to centralize and streamline campaign management, prepare email blasts and reports on marketing effectiveness, analyze social networks and provide insights on what individuals are saying about Let’s Get Ready to drive more informed business decisions. As part of the project we had a very memorable conversation with a Let’s Get Ready alumnus who grew up in an underserved community and spearheaded the Let’s Get Ready program at his high school. He explained that the program taught him how to believe in himself because — while many low income students believe that higher education is not made for them, Let’s Get Ready breaks down these barriers and helps students realize “that they can belong”. This conversation put the project into perspective for us: we were not simply helping Let’s Get Ready with a marketing strategy, we were working with them to give more high school students the opportunity, resources and ability to live their dreams. This mindset allowed us to break out of our typical tax and accounting background and pushed us to think outside the box when it came to the organization’s marketing strategy. For example, we recommended that students write thank you cards and create videos to send to the donors highlighting the impact of donor dollars. One of the stakeholders we spoke to described Let’s Get Ready as an organization with a purpose that “pulls at your heartstrings,” and that is exactly what it did for us. We completed the project with a sense of fulfillment and renewed energy, wanting to continue to contribute to society through purpose-led efforts and different application of the skills we use everyday with our clients.

On February 20, more than 35 PwC professionals in Tampa participated in a Skills for Society ScopeAthon, a half-day skills-based volunteering event with eight local nonprofit organizations: Camelot Community Care, Eckerd Connects, Junior Achievement of Tampa Bay, Metropolitan Ministries, Police Athletic League, ReDefiners World Languages, The First Tee of Tampa Bay and Voices for Children of Tampa Bay. The ScopeAthon event matched three to five PwCers with one of the nonprofits to diagnose a pressing challenge and build an actionable roadmap to tackle it. The day began with a brief training session from Skills for Society collaborator, the Taproot Foundation, on uncovering the root cause of a challenge and identifying a high-impact, feasible solution. Nonprofit teams left the event with clearer paths forward on how to implement a solution on their own or through additional support from Skills for Society. This ScopeAthon provided our people the opportunity to use their skills, expand their networks and make an impact with organizations doing important work in our communities. Here’s what a two participants had to say: “I found it extremely rewarding to leverage the skills I've built over my time at PwC and use them to make a contribution to a worthwhile cause. It was a great experience to work with Metropolitan Ministries’ CEO and leadership team, listen to their challenges, provide our insights and a roadmap to help them achieve their goals.” - Jeff Lambert, director “My experience with the ScopeAThon was eye-opening and informative. It was inspiring to see the commitment of our nonprofit team to do the best for the families served by their organization. They were engaged and open to discussing their challenges, and were very interested in the process. They were excited to bring our scope proposal to their leadership to show what we'd concluded and how the organization could move forward. I found it to be a very valuable experience that I would repeat, given the opportunity.” - Monica Barrett, director How can you get involved? Skills for Society is a new approach to the way we build skills and make an impact in our communities through Your Tomorrow. We’re putting our digital and professional capabilities to work with nonprofits on some of the biggest societal challenges we face today, so we can make a difference while continuing to grow and develop.

Microsoft’s problem Microsoft operates globally in a complex regulatory environment. While undergoing a business model transformation, it faced challenges with Transfer Pricing—the process by which transferring prices of goods, intangibles, and services among enterprises under common ownership are booked, invoiced, and reconciled. Microsoft’s leaders looked for a documented process to increase efficiencies and lower risk, while eliminating dependency on individual “knowledge heroes” (B), create a simple view of transfer pricing through tight controls (X), and leverage a powerful platform that could scale with the needs of their global organization (T). We surprised the client with our One Firm approach. We created a Magic Moment... Our agile model was very different from what Microsoft expected, which offered a compelling alternative to standard third-party outsourcing. We brought our Tax, Advisory, Finance, and SAP capabilities, with risk and regulatory knowledge and digital enablement—powered by SAP—through our Finance Transformation Integrated Solution. The result? A robust solution from design, build, and deployment that delivered high quality results. We showed the client how to prevent a $1 billion loss. The solution and value we brought Microsoft now has a transparent Transfer Pricing solution that will: Enable detection of a calculation error that prevented a $1 billion loss. Create a single source of data and reduce manual processes that have shortened cycle time by 5 days and virtually eliminate bottlenecks. Enable clear roadmaps with replicability and reduce audit risks. Provide a future state that will meet changing statutory requirements more quickly and support organizational change.

As a part of our Access Your Potential (AYP) commitment, volunteers taught lessons about financial literacy, workforce readiness, and being part of a community in 17 kindergarten through second grade classrooms. The reception from the students, teachers, and administrators was so positive that PwC has already been invited back to teach in all 35 of the school’s classrooms next year! Special thanks to Palmo Tenzin, Anthony Colucci, Sheridan Smith, Jason Finkelstein, and JA Board Member and LA Advisory AYP Lead Mark Spratt for making this great event a reality.

At PwC, we are using this time to celebrate the contributions of our LGBT+ community, reinforce our commitment to our LGBT+ colleagues and create a sense of belonging for all. We are starting the month with the introduction of a new global brand for our LGBT+ efforts — Shine. Shine represents our commitment to spotlighting and supporting our LGBT+ colleagues and the issues facing their community, while also uniting our LGBT+ community around the globe with one name. “Taking inspiration from the bright shining colors in a rainbow, an iconic LGBT+ symbol, this new name signifies how our people shine a light on the important issues that impact the LGBT+ community — and how they bring their authentic selves to work every day. By working to build trust in society, making our workplace and culture stronger, and creating brighter opportunities, PwC’s LGBT+ community helps each and every one of PwC’s people truly shine,” said Jeff Bharkhda, US Shine partner champion. We’ll mark Pride month in a number of ways, including supporting a team of 100 riders and roadies from around the globe in the AIDS Lifecycle ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles. The PwC team has raised more than $1 million to support AIDS research, making us the top corporate team fundraiser for three years in a row. At the end of the month, more than 160 delegates of Shine from across the globe will gather in New York City for our first-ever Global LGBT+ Summit. During the program, delegates will discuss issues affecting the firm and the LGBT+ community at large, hear from internal and external speakers who will share their experiences and insights, and discuss best practices that can be applied in their day-to-day interactions.

Through this program, you simply send a weekly email and meet once a month to empower a student to graduate high school and pursue their college aspirations. The hours you contribute to this organization count toward PwC’s Access Your Potential commitment. For more information, please attend one of our information sessions this summer: July iMentor Information Session Date: Wednesday, July 24, 2019 Time: 12:30pm to 1:30pm Location: 300 Madison – 22302 Lincoln Center Sign up to attend the July iMentor information session August iMentor Information Session Date: Wednesday, August 21, 2019 Time: 12:30pm to 1:30pm Location: 300 Madison – 22302 Lincoln Center Sign up to attend the August iMentor information session What is the program time commitment? The iMentor model provides flexibility to enable their mentors to volunteer even with a busy work schedule. Getting involved with iMentor is a great way to do something outside of client service that is truly impactful. 1.) Weekly email communication (3 times a month) - iMentor will provide a weekly writing prompt / topic for each Mentor and student to exchange to promote targeted, in-depth discussions addressing college readiness and success. 2.) Monthly in person meetings (once a month) - Mentors and students get together for in-person meetings, lasting two hours. The events and locations for these in-person meetings are all arranged by iMentor. All that is required of you as a Mentor is to attend. Questions about iMentor or looking to volunteer? The PwC champions for the iMentor program are Tamir, Zinger, Conor Queenan and Sean Hill.

The word "turbofan" is a portmanteau of "turbine" and "fan": the turbo portion refers to a gas turbine engine which achieves mechanical energy from combustion,[1] and the fan, a ducted fan that uses the mechanical energy from the gas turbine to accelerate air rearwards. Thus, whereas all the air taken in by a turbojet passes through the turbine (through the combustion chamber), in a turbofan some of that air bypasses the turbine. A turbofan thus can be thought of as a turbojet being used to drive a ducted fan, with both of these contributing to the thrust. The ratio of the mass-flow of air bypassing the engine core divided by the mass-flow of air passing through the core is referred to as the bypass ratio. The engine produces thrust through a combination of these two portions working together; engines that use more jet thrust relative to fan thrust are known as low-bypass turbofans, conversely those that have considerably more fan thrust than jet thrust are known as high-bypass. Most commercial aviation jet engines in use today are of the high-bypass type,[2][3] and most modern military fighter engines are low-bypass.[4][5] Afterburners are not used on high-bypass turbofan engines but may be used on either low-bypass turbofan or turbojet engines. Modern turbofans have either a large single-stage fan or a smaller fan with several stages. An early configuration combined a low-pressure turbine and fan in a single rear-mounted unit.The bypass ratio (BPR) of a turbofan engine is the ratio between the mass flow rate of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core.[6] A 10:1 bypass ratio, for example, means that 10 kg of air passes through the bypass duct for every 1 kg of air passing through the core. Turbofan engines are usually described in terms of BPR, which together with overall pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature and fan pressure ratio are important design parameters. In addition BPR is quoted for turboprop and unducted fan installations because their high propulsive efficiency gives them the overall efficiency characteristics of very high bypass turbofans. This allows them to be shown together with turbofans on plots which show trends of reducing specific fuel consumption (SFC) with increasing BPR.[7] BPR can also be quoted for lift fan installations where the fan airflow is remote from the engine and doesn't flow past the engine core. A higher BPR provides a lower fuel consumption for the same thrust. If all the gas power from a gas turbine is converted to kinetic energy in a propelling nozzle, the aircraft is best suited to high supersonic speeds. If it is all transferred to a separate big mass of air with low kinetic energy, the aircraft is best suited to zero speed (hovering). For speeds in between, the gas power is shared between a separate airstream and the gas turbine's own nozzle flow in a proportion which gives the aircraft performance required. The trade off between mass flow and velocity is also seen with propellers and helicopter rotors by comparing disc loading and power loading.[8] For example, the same helicopter weight can be supported by a high power engine and small diameter rotor or, for less fuel, a lower power engine and bigger rotor with lower velocity through the rotor. Bypass usually refers to transferring gas power from a gas turbine to a bypass stream of air to reduce fuel consumption and jet noise. Alternatively, there may be a requirement for an afterburning engine where the sole requirement for bypass is to provide cooling air. This sets the lower limit for bpr and these engines have been called "leaky" or continuous bleed turbojets[9] (General Electric YJ-101 bpr 0.25) and low bpr turbojets[10] (Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120). Low bpr (0.2) has also been used to provide surge margin as well as afterburner cooling for the Pratt &amp; Whitney J58.[11] Efficiency[edit] Since the efficiency of propulsion is a function of the relative airspeed of the exhaust to the surrounding air, propellers are most efficient for low speed, pure jets for high speeds, and ducted fans in the middle. Turbofans are thus the most efficient engines in the range of speeds from about 500 to 1,000 km/h (310 to 620 mph), the speed at which most commercial aircraft operate.[12][13] Turbofans retain an efficiency edge over pure jets at low supersonic speeds up to roughly Mach 1.6 (1,960.1 km/h; 1,217.9 mph). In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine the high temperature and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a propelling nozzle and produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power produced by the turbine. In a bypass design extra turbines drive a ducted fan that accelerates air rearward from the front of the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to turboprops in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine's gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between turbojets, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less).[14] Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gave significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet's low-loss propelling nozzle.[15] The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct, and extra propelling nozzle compared to the turbojet's single nozzle. Thrust[edit] While a turbojet engine uses all of the engine's output to produce thrust in the form of a hot high-velocity exhaust gas jet, a turbofan's cool low-velocity bypass air yields between 30% and 70% of the total thrust produced by a turbofan system.[16] The thrust (FN) generated by a turbofan depends on the effective exhaust velocity of the total exhaust, as with any jet engine, but because two exhaust jets are present the thrust equation can be expanded as:[17] {\displaystyle F_{N}={\dot {m}}_{e}v_{he}-{\dot {m}}_{o}v_{o}+BPR\,({\dot {m}}_{c}v_{f})} where: ṁ e = the mass rate of hot combustion exhaust flow from the core engine ṁo = the mass rate of total air flow entering the turbofan = ṁc + ṁf ṁc = the mass rate of intake air that flows to the core engine ṁf = the mass rate of intake air that bypasses the core engine vf = the velocity of the air flow bypassed around the core engine vhe = the velocity of the hot exhaust gas from the core engine vo = the velocity of the total air intake = the true airspeed of the aircraft BPR = Bypass Ratio Nozzles[edit] The cold duct and core duct's nozzle systems are relatively complex due to there being two exhaust flows. In high bypass engines the fan is generally situated in a short duct near the front of the engine and typically has a convergent cold nozzle, with the tail of the duct forming a low pressure ratio nozzle that under normal conditions will choke creating supersonic flow patterns around the core. The core nozzle is more conventional, but generates less of the thrust, and depending on design choices, such as noise considerations, may conceivably not choke.[18] In low bypass engines the two flows may combine within the ducts, and share a common nozzle, which can be fitted with afterburner. Noise[edit] Most of the air flow through a high-bypass turbofan is lower velocity bypass flow: even when combined with the much higher velocity engine exhaust, the average exhaust velocity is considerably lower than in a pure turbojet. Turbojet engine noise is predominately jet noise from the high exhaust velocity, therefore turbofan engines are significantly quieter than a pure-jet of the same thrust, and jet noise is no longer the predominant source.[19] Turbofan engine noise propagates both upstream via the inlet and downstream via the primary nozzle and the by-pass duct. Other noise sources are the fan, compressor and turbine.[20] Modern commercial aircraft employ high-bypass-ratio (HBPR) engines with separate flow, non-mixing, short-duct exhaust systems. Their noise is due to the speed, temperature, and pressure of the exhaust jet, especially during high thrust conditions such as those required for takeoff. The primary source of jet noise is the turbulent mixing of shear layers in the engine's exhaust. These shear layers contain instabilities that lead to highly turbulent vortices that generate the pressure fluctuations responsible for sound. To reduce the noise associated with jet flow, the aerospace industry has sought to disrupt shear layer turbulence and reduce the overall noise produced. The fan noise is a tonal noise and its signature depends on the fan rotational speed: at low speed, as during an approach, the fan noise is due to the interaction of the blades with the distorted flow injected in the engine; at high engine ratings, as at takeoff, the fan tip is supersonic and this allows intense rotor-locked duct modes to propagate upstream; this noise is known as "buzz saw".[21 Pristina[1] or Prishtina (UK: /ˈpriːʃtɪnə, prɪʃˈtiːnə/,[2] US: /ˈprɪʃtɪnə, -nɑː/;[3][4] Albanian: Prishtina or Prishtinë [pɾiʃˈtinə] (listen); Serbian: Приштина, romanized: Priština) is the capital and largest city of Kosovo.[a] The city has a majority Albanian population, alongside other smaller communities. With a municipal population of 204,721 inhabitants (2016), Pristina is the second-largest city in the world with a predominantly Albanian-speaking population, after Albania's capital, Tirana.[5][6] Within Serbia, it would be the 4th largest. Geographically, it is located in the north-eastern part of Kosovo close to the Goljak mountains. During the Paleolithic Age, what is now the area of Pristina was envolved by the Vinča culture. It was home to several Illyrian and Roman people at the classical times. King Bardyllis brought various tribes together in the area of Pristina in the 4th century BC, establishing the Dardanian Kingdom.[7][8][9] The heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient city of Ulpiana, that was considered one of the most important Roman cities in the Balkan peninsula. Between the 5th and the 9th century the area was part of the Byzantine Empire. In the middle of the 9th century it was ceded to the First Bulgarian Empire. In the early 11th century it fell under Byzantine rule and was included into a new province called Bulgaria. Between the late 11th and middle of the 13th century it was ceded several times to the Second Bulgarian Empire. In the late Middle Ages, Pristina was an important town in Medieval Serbia and also the royal estate of Stefan Milutin, Stefan Uroš III, Stefan Dušan, Stefan Uroš V and Vuk Branković.[10] Following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, Pristina became an important mining and trading center due to its strategic position near the rich mining town of Novo Brdo. The city was known for its trade fairs and items, such as goatskin and goat hair as well as gunpowder.[11] The first mosque in Pristina was built in the late 14th century while under Serbian rule.[12] Tolerance and coexistence of religion and culture has been part of the society for centuries. Pristina is the most important transportation junction of Kosovo, for air, rail, and roads. The international airport of Pristina is the largest airport of the country and among the largest in the region. A range of expressways and motorways, such as the R6, R7 and R7.1, radiate out the city and connect it to Albania and North Macedonia. Pristina is as well as the most essential economic, financial, political and trade center of Kosovo mostly due to its significant location in the center of the country.

multi col text-2 Test multi col text-2 Earl's Court Square is a garden square in Earl's Court, London, England. It was developed from 1872 or 1873 on agricultural land belonging to the Edwardes family. It is primarily made up of stuccoed terraced houses with Italianate dressings but also contains properties in the Jacobean and Second Empire styles as well as a number of purpose built apartment blocks. Notable former inhabitants include the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton, Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, and the ordnance inventor Sir William Palliser. In the 1970s the "Battle of Earl's Court" was fought between traditionalist and modernist factions at the Poetry Bookshop in the Square. History and architecture[edit] The Square was developed from 1872[2] or 1873[3] on agricultural land originally belonging to the Rich family and then to the Edwardes family[4] with the south side being developed last.[2] The terrace numbered 30 to 52 (even) on the south side was built in the Jacobean Revival style in 1888–1890.[2][3] The general style of architecture is stuccoed terraced houses with Italianate dressings and upper floor balconies supported by columns, but there are several styles in the square including buildings that have Jacobean and Second Empire influences.[2] There are several purpose built apartment blocks, including Wetherby Mansions, Herbert Court Mansions, Langham Mansions, and more recently, Northgate House, built in 1965.[3] By the 1970s, the Square was "extremely run down", and "there were two squalid brothels, they were at no. 9 and in the A-L block of Wetherby Mansions that were eventually evicted by the borough's Health Inspector and a sordid murder occurred at no. 4."[4] The Poetry Society Bookshop was located at number 21 and in the 1970s was the scene of the "Battle of Earl's Court" when traditionalist and modernist poets fought for the future of British poetry during the British Poetry Revival after the modernists took over the conservative Poetry Society.[5][6][7] There are no listed buildings in the Square but it was given conservation area status in 1975.[3] The United Nations is headquartered in New York City, in a complex designed by a board of architects led by Wallace Harrison, and built by the architectural firm Harrison &amp; Abramovitz. The complex has served as the official headquarters of the United Nations since its completion in 1952. It is located in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, on 17 to 18 acres (6.9 to 7.3 ha) of grounds overlooking the East River. Its borders are First Avenue on the west, East 42nd Street to the south, East 48th Street on the north and the East River to the east.[4] The term "Turtle Bay" is occasionally used as a metonym for the UN headquarters or for the United Nations as a whole.[5] The headquarters holds the seats of the principal organs of the UN, including the General Assembly and the Security Council, but excluding the International Court of Justice, which is seated in the Hague. The United Nations has three additional, subsidiary, regional headquarters, or headquarters districts. These were opened in Geneva (Switzerland) in 1946, Vienna (Austria) in 1980, and Nairobi (Kenya) in 1996.[6][7] These adjunct offices help represent UN interests, facilitate diplomatic activities, and enjoy certain extraterritorial privileges, but do not contain the seats of major organs. Although it is situated in New York City, the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations and not the U.S. government. They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, fire protection and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.[8] None of the United Nations' 15 specialized agencies (such as UNESCO) are located at the headquarters. However, some "autonomous subsidiary organs", such as UNICEF, have their headquarters at the UNHQ. History[edit] Planning[edit] Site[edit] The headquarters of the United Nations occupies a site beside the East River, on between 17 and 18 acres (6.9 and 7.3 ha)[a] of land purchased from the real estate developer William Zeckendorf Sr.[11] At the time, the site was part of Turtle Bay, which contained slaughterhouses and tenement buildings, as well as the original Eberhard Faber Pencil Factory.[9] By the 1910s, there was also a pencil factory and a gas company building in Turtle Bay, on the site of the current UN headquarters. The development of Sutton Place and Beekman Place, north of the current UN site, came in the 1920s. A yacht club on the site was proposed in 1925, but it proved to be too expensive.[11] In 1946, Zeckendorf purchased the land with the intention to create an "X City" on the site.[10] This complex was to contain an office building and a hotel, each 57 stories tall, and an entertainment complex between them. The X City would have also had smaller apartment and office towers.[11] However, the $8.5 million ($72 million in 2018) for X City never materialized, and Nelson Rockefeller purchased an option for Zeckendorf's waterfront land in Turtle Bay. The purchase was funded by Nelson's father, John D. Rockefeller Jr.. The Rockefeller family owned the Tudor City Apartments across First Avenue from the Zeckendorf site.[10] The city, in turn, spent $5 million ($43 million in 2018) on clearing the land.[9] Design[edit] Map of the United Nations headquarters in Dutch. The green rectangle is the Dag Hammarskjöld Library, the purple rectangle is the Secretariat, the blue trapezoid is the Conference Building, and the grey shape is the General Assembly Building While the United Nations had dreamed of constructing an independent city for its new world capital, multiple obstacles soon forced the organization to downsize their plans. They ultimately decided to build on Rockefeller's East River plot, since the land was free and the land's owners were well known.[11] The diminutive site on the East River necessitated a Rockefeller Center-type vertical complex, thus, it was a given that the Secretariat would be housed in a tall office tower. During daily meetings from February to June 1947, the collaborative team produced at least 45 designs and variations. Rather than hold a competition for the design of the facilities for the headquarters, the UN decided to commission a multinational team of leading architects to collaborate on the design. Harrison was named as Director of Planning, and a Board of Design Consultants was composed of architects, planners and engineers nominated by member governments. The board consisted of N. D. Bassov of the Soviet Union, Gaston Brunfaut (Belgium), Ernest Cormier (Canada), Le Corbusier (France), Liang Seu-cheng (China), Sven Markelius (Sweden), Oscar Niemeyer (Brazil), Howard Robertson (United Kingdom), G. A. Soilleux (Australia), and Julio Vilamajó (Uruguay).[12][11] Niemeyer met with Corbusier at the latter's request shortly after the former arrived in New York City. Corbusier had already been lobbying hard to promote his own scheme 23, and thus, requested that Niemeyer not submit a design, lest he further confuse the contentious meetings of the Board of Design. Instead, he asked the younger architect to assist him with his project. Niemeyer began to absent himself from the meetings. Only after Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz repeatedly pressed him to participate did Niemeyer agree to submit his own project. Niemeyer's project 32 was finally chosen, but as opposed to Corbusier's project 23, which consisted of one building containing both the Assembly Hall and the councils in the center of the site (as it was hierarchically the most important building), Niemeyer's plan split the councils from the Assembly Hall, locating the first alongside the river, and the second on the right side of the secretariat. This would not split the site, but on the contrary, would create a large civic square.[13] UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld in front of the General Assembly building (1950s) After much discussion, Harrison, who coordinated the meetings, determined that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers near the center of the site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building to the north of this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well. The UN headquarters was originally proposed alongside a grand boulevard leading eastward from Third Avenue or Lexington Avenue, between 46th Street to the south and 49th Street to the north. These plans were eventually downsized into Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza, a small plaza on the south side of 47th Street east of Second Avenue.[11] Wallace Harrison's assistant, architect George Dudley, later stated: "It literally took our breath away to see the simple plane of the site kept open from First Avenue to the River, only three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind them along the river’s edge...[Niemeyer] also said, ‘beauty will come from the buildings being in the right space!’. The comparison between Le Corbusier's heavy block and Niemeyer's startling, elegantly articulated composition seemed to me to be in everyone's mind..."[14] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back to the center of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: "I felt [Corbusier] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today.[15] Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.[16] Proposed alternatives[edit] Flags of the member states, arranged in alphabetical order Many cities vied for the honor of hosting the UN Headquarters site, prior to the selection of New York City. The selection of the East River site came after over a year of protracted study and consideration of many sites in the United States. A powerful faction among the delegates advocated returning to the former League of Nations complex in Geneva, Switzerland.[17] Suggestions came from far and wide including such fanciful suggestions as a ship on the high seas to housing the entire complex in a single tall building. Amateur architects submitted designs, local governments offered park areas, but the determined group of New York City boosters that included such luminaries as Grover Whalen, Thomas J. Watson, and Nelson Rockefeller, coordinated efforts with the powerful Coordinator of Construction, Robert Moses, and Mayor William O'Dwyer, to assemble acceptable interim facilities. Their determined courtship of the UN Interim Site committee resulted in the early meetings taking place at multiple locations throughout the New York area. Sites in San Francisco (including the Presidio) and Marin County in California; St. Louis, Missouri; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Westchester County and Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in New York; Tuskahoma, Oklahoma; the Black Hills of South Dakota; Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan; and a site on Navy Island straddling the U.S.-Canada border were considered as potential sites for the UN Headquarters.[18][19] San Francisco, where the UN Headquarters delegation was held, was favored by Australia, New Zealand, China, and the Philippines due to the city's proximity to their countries.[18] The UN and many of its delegates seriously considered Philadelphia for the headquarters; the city offered to donate land in several select sites, including Fairmount Park, Andorra, and a Center City location which would have placed the headquarters along a mall extending from Independence Hall to Penn's Landing.[18] The Manhattan site was ultimately chosen over Philadelphia after John D. Rockefeller, Jr., offered to donate $8.5 million to purchase the land along the East River.;[20] Robert Moses and Rockefeller Sr. convinced Nelson Rockefeller to buy the land after the Rockefeller's Kykuit estate in Mount Pleasant, New York was deemed too isolated from Manhattan.[21] The Royal Albert Hall is a concert hall on the northern edge of South Kensington, London. One of the United Kingdom's most treasured and distinctive buildings, it is a registered charity held in trust for the nation, as it receives no public or government funding.[2] It can seat 5,272.[1] Since the hall's opening by Queen Victoria in 1871, the world's leading artists from many performance genres have appeared on its stage. It is the venue for some of the most notable events in British culture, in particular the Proms concerts, which have been held there every summer since 1941. It is host to more than 390 shows in the main auditorium annually, including classical, rock and pop concerts, ballet, opera, film screenings with live orchestral accompaniment, sports, awards ceremonies, school and community events, and charity performances and banquets. A further 400 events are held each year in the non-auditorium spaces. The hall was originally supposed to have been called the Central Hall of Arts and Sciences, but the name was changed to the Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences by Queen Victoria upon laying the Hall's foundation stone in 1867, in memory of her husband, Prince Albert, who had died six years earlier. It forms the practical part of a memorial to the Prince Consort; the decorative part is the Albert Memorial directly to the north in Kensington Gardens, now separated from the Hall by Kensington Gore.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/mayur-testing/test-141.html</url><pwc_title>Test 14</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-10-25 16:52:00</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Test 14 Test 14</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/mayur-testing/test-785.html</url><pwc_title>Test 785</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-11-25 17:03:50</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>event</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate>2019-11-25 16:17:00</pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate>2019-11-25 17:17:00</pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Test 785 Test 785 Key Dates Key Dates</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/mayur-testing/test-c---h-alerts.html</url><pwc_title>Test C &amp; H alerts</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-12-03 14:56:47</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title>Test Common attribute for both alerts</pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype></pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav></pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Test C &amp; H alerts</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/mayur-testing/test-421.html</url><pwc_title>Test-421</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-10-24 19:20:35</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title></pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title></pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype></pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav></pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Test-421 Sanika Date Testing_LP Distributed-element circuits are electrical circuits composed of lengths of transmission lines or other distributed components. These circuits perform the same functions as conventional circuits composed of passive components, such as capacitors, inductors, and transformers. They are used mostly at microwave frequencies, where conventional components are difficult (or impossible) to implement.Conventional circuits consist of individual components manufactured separately then connected together with a conducting medium. Distributed-element circuits are built by forming the medium itself into specific patterns. A major advantage of distributed-element circuits is that they can be produced cheaply as a printed circuit board for consumer products, such as satellite television. They are also made in coaxial and waveguide formats for applications such as radar, satellite communication, and microwave links.A phenomenon commonly used in distributed-element circuits is that a length of transmission line can be made to behave as a resonator. Distributed-element components which do this include stubs, coupled lines, and cascaded lines. Circuits built from these components include filters, power dividers, directional couplers, and circulators.Distributed-element circuits were studied during the 1920s and 1930s but did not become important until World War II, when they were used in radar. After the war their use was limited to military, space, and broadcasting infrastructure, but improvements in materials science in the field soon led to broader applications. They can now be found in domestic products such as satellite dishes and mobile phones. Circuit modelling Distributed-element circuits are designed with the distributed-element model, an alternative to the lumped-element model in which the passive electrical elements of electrical resistance, capacitance and inductance are assumed to be "lumped" at one point in space in a resistor, capacitor or inductor, respectively. The distributed-element model is used when this assumption no longer holds, and these properties are considered to be distributed in space. The assumption breaks down when there is significant time for electromagnetic waves to travel from one terminal of a component to the other; "significant", in this context, implies enough time for a noticeable phase change. The amount of phase change is dependent on the wave's frequency (and inversely dependent on wavelength). A common rule of thumb amongst engineers is to change from the lumped to the distributed model when distances involved are more than one-tenth of a wavelength (a 36° phase change). The lumped model completely fails at one-quarter wavelength (a 90° phase change), with not only the value, but the nature of the component not being as predicted. Due to this dependence on wavelength, the distributed-element model is used mostly at higher frequencies; at low frequencies, distributed-element components are too bulky. Distributed designs are feasible above 300 MHz, and are the technology of choice at microwave frequencies above 1 GHz.[1] There is no clear-cut demarcation in the frequency at which these models should be used. Although the changeover is usually somewhere in the 100-to-500 MHz range, the technological scale is also significant; miniaturised circuits can use the lumped model at a higher frequency. Printed circuit boards (PCBs) using through-hole technology are larger than equivalent designs using surface-mount technology. Hybrid integrated circuits are smaller than PCB technologies, and monolithic integrated circuits are smaller than both. Integrated circuits can use lumped designs at higher frequencies than printed circuits, and this is done in some radio frequency integrated circuits. This choice is particularly significant for hand-held devices, because lumped-element designs generally result in a smaller product.[2] Construction with transmission lines Frequency response of a fifth-order Chebyshev filter constructed from lumped (top) and distributed components (bottom) The overwhelming majority of distributed-element circuits are composed of lengths of transmission line, a particularly simple form to model. The cross-sectional dimensions of the line are unvarying along its length, and are small compared to the signal wavelength; thus, only distribution along the length of the line need be considered. Such an element of a distributed circuit is entirely characterised by its length and characteristic impedance. A further simplification occurs in commensurate line circuits, where all the elements are the same length. With commensurate circuits, a lumped circuit design prototype consisting of capacitors and inductors can be directly converted into a distributed circuit with a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of each circuit.[3] Commensurate line circuits are important because a design theory for producing them exists; no general theory exists for circuits consisting of arbitrary lengths of transmission line (or any arbitrary shapes). Although an arbitrary shape can be analysed with Maxwell's equations to determine its behaviour, finding useful structures is a matter of trial and error or guesswork.[4] An important difference between distributed-element circuits and lumped-element circuits is that the frequency response of a distributed circuit periodically repeats as shown in the Chebyshev filter example; the equivalent lumped circuit does not. This is a result of the transfer function of lumped forms being a rational function of complex frequency; distributed forms are an irrational function. Another difference is that cascade-connected lengths of line introduce a fixed delay at all frequencies (assuming an ideal line). There is no equivalent in lumped circuits for a fixed delay, although an approximation could be constructed for a limited frequency range.[5] Advantages and disadvantages Distributed-element circuits are cheap and easy to manufacture in some formats, but take up more space than lumped-element circuits. This is problematic in mobile devices (especially hand-held ones), where space is at a premium. If the operating frequencies are not too high, the designer may miniaturise components rather than switching to distributed elements. However, parasitic elements and resistive losses in lumped components are greater with increasing frequency as a proportion of the nominal value of the lumped-element impedance. In some cases, designers may choose a distributed-element design (even if lumped components are available at that frequency) to benefit from improved quality. Distributed-element designs tend to have greater power-handling capability; with a lumped component, all the energy passed by a circuit is concentrated in a small volume.[6] Media Paired conductors Several types of transmission line exist, and any of them can be used to construct distributed-element circuits. The oldest (and still most widely used) is a pair of conductors; its most common form is twisted pair, used for telephone lines and Internet connections. It is not often used for distributed-element circuits because the frequencies used are lower than the point where distributed-element designs become advantageous. However, designers frequently begin with a lumped-element design and convert it to an open-wire distributed-element design. Open wire is a pair of parallel uninsulated conductors used, for instance, for telephone lines on telegraph poles. The designer does not usually intend to implement the circuit in this form; it is an intermediate step in the design process. Distributed-element designs with conductor pairs are limited to a few specialised uses, such as Lecher lines and the twin-lead used for antenna feed lines.[7] Coaxial A collection of coaxial directional couplers. One has the cover removed, showing its internal structure. Coaxial line, a centre conductor surrounded by an insulated shielding conductor, is widely used for interconnecting units of microwave equipment and for longer-distance transmissions. Although coaxial distributed-element devices were commonly manufactured during the second half of the 20th century, they have been replaced in many applications by planar forms due to cost and size considerations. Air-dielectric coaxial line is used for low-loss and high-power applications. Distributed-element circuits in other media still commonly transition to coaxial connectors at the circuit ports for intrconnection purposes.[8] Planar Main article: Planar transmission line The majority of modern distributed-element circuits use planar transmission lines, especially those in mass-produced consumer items. There are several forms of planar line, but the kind known as microstrip is the most common. It can be manufactured by the same process as printed circuit boards and hence is cheap to make. It also lends itself to integration with lumped circuits on the same board. Other forms of printed planar lines include stripline, finline and many variations. Planar lines can also be used in monolithic microwave integrated circuits, where they are integral to the device chip.[9] Waveguide Main article: waveguide (electromagnetism) A waveguide filter Many distributed-element designs can be directly implemented in waveguide. However, there is an additional complication with waveguides in that multiple modes are possible. These sometimes exist simultaneously, and this situation has no analogy in conducting lines. Waveguides have the advantages of lower loss and higher quality resonators over conducting lines, but their relative expense and bulk means that microstrip is often preferred. Waveguide mostly finds uses in high-end products, such as high-power military radars and the upper microwave bands (where planar formats are too lossy). Waveguide becomes bulkier with lower frequency, which militates against its use on the lower bands.[10] Mechanical In a few specialist applications, such as the mechanical filters in high-end radio transmitters (marine, military, amateur radio), electronic circuits can be implemented as mechanical components; this is done largely because of the high quality of the mechanical resonators. They are used in the radio frequency band (below microwave frequencies), where waveguides might otherwise be used. Mechanical circuits can also be implemented, in whole or in part, as distributed-element circuits. The frequency at which the transition to distributed-element design becomes feasible (or necessary) is much lower with mechanical circuits. This is because the speed at which signals travel through mechanical media is much lower than the speed of electrical signals.[11] Circuit components There are several structures that are repeatedly used in distributed-element circuits. Some of the common ones are described below. Stub Main article: Stub (electronics) A stub is a short length of line that branches to the side of a main line. The end of the stub is often left open- or short-circuited, but may also be terminated with a lumped component. A stub can be used on its own (for instance, for impedance matching), or several of them can be used together in a more complex circuit such as a filter. A stub can be designed as the equivalent of a lumped capacitor, inductor, or resonator.[12] Butterfly stub filter Departures from constructing with uniform transmission lines in distributed-element circuits are rare. One such departure that is widely used is the radial stub, which is shaped like a sector of a circle. They are often used in pairs, one on either side of the main transmission line. Such pairs are called butterfly or bowtie stubs.[13] Coupled lines Coupled lines are two transmission lines between which there is some electromagnetic coupling. The coupling can be direct or indirect. In indirect coupling, the two lines are run closely together for a distance with no screening between them. The strength of the coupling depends on the distance between the lines and the cross-section presented to the other line. In direct coupling, branch lines directly connect the two main lines together at intervals.[14] Coupled lines are a common method of constructing power dividers and directional couplers. Another property of coupled lines is that they act as a pair of coupled resonators. This property is used in many distributed-element filters.[15] Cascaded lines An orthomode transducer (a variety of duplexer) with stepped impedance matching Cascaded lines are lengths of transmission line where the output of one line is connected to the input of the next. Multiple cascaded lines of different characteristic impedances can be used to construct a filter or a wide-band impedance matching network. This is called a stepped impedance structure.[16] A single, cascaded line one-quarter wavelength long forms a quarter-wave impedance transformer. This has the useful property of transforming any impedance network into its dual; in this role, it is called an impedance inverter. This structure can be used in filters to implement a lumped-element prototype in ladder topology as a distributed-element circuit. The quarter-wave transformers are alternated with a distributed-element resonator to achieve this. However, this is now a dated design; more compact inverters, such as the impedance step, are used instead. An impedance step is the discontinuity formed at the junction of two cascaded transmission lines with different characteristic impedances.[17] Cavity resonator A cavity resonator is an empty (or sometimes dielectric-filled) space surrounded by conducting walls. Apertures in the walls couple the resonator to the rest of the circuit. Resonance occurs due to electromagnetic waves reflected back and forth from the cavity walls setting up standing waves. Cavity resonators can be used in many media, but are most naturally formed in waveguide from the already existing metal walls of the guide.[18] Dielectric resonator Main article: dielectric resonator A dielectric resonator is a piece of dielectric material exposed to electromagnetic waves. It is most often in the form of a cylinder or thick disc. Although cavity resonators can be filled with dielectric, the essential difference is that in cavity resonators the electromagnetic field is entirely contained within the cavity walls. A dielectric resonator has some field in the surrounding space. This can lead to undesirable coupling with other components. The major advantage of dielectric resonators is that they are considerably smaller than the equivalent air-filled cavity.[19] Helical resonator Main article: Helical resonator A helical resonator is a helix of wire in a cavity; one end is unconnected, and the other is bonded to the cavity wall. Although they are superficially similar to lumped inductors, helical resonators are distributed-element components and are used in the VHF and lower UHF bands.[20] Fractals See also: Fractal antenna Three-iteration Hilbert fractal resonator in microstrip[21] The use of fractal curves as a circuit component is an emerging field in distributed-element circuits.[22] Fractals have been used to make resonators for filters and antennae. One of the benefits of using fractals is their space-filling property, making them smaller than other designs.[23] Other advantages include the ability to produce wide-band and multi-band designs, good in-band performance, and good out-of-band rejection.[24] In practice, a true fractal cannot be made because at each fractal iteration the manufacturing tolerances become tighter and are eventually greater than the construction method can achieve. However, after a small number of iterations, the performance is close to that of a true fractal. These may be called pre-fractals or finite-order fractals where it is necessary to distinguish from a true fractal.[25] Fractals that have been used as a circuit component include the Koch snowflake, Minkowski island, Sierpiński curve, Hilbert curve, and Peano curve.[26] The first three are closed curves, suitable for patch antennae. The latter two are open curves with terminations on opposite sides of the fractal. This makes them suitable for use where a connection in cascade is required.[27] Taper A taper is a transmission line with a gradual change in cross-section. It can be considered the limiting case of the stepped impedance structure with an infinite number of steps.[28] Tapers are a simple way of joining two transmission lines of different characteristic impedances. Using tapers greatly reduces the mismatch effects that a direct join would cause. If the change in cross-section is not too great, no other matching circuitry may be needed.[29] Tapers can provide transitions between lines in different media, especially different forms of planar media.[30] Tapers commonly change shape linearly, but a variety of other profiles may be used. The profile that achieves a specified match in the shortest length is known as a Klopfenstein taper and is based on the Chebychev filter design.[31] Tapers can be used to match a transmission line to an antenna. In some designs, such as the horn antenna and Vivaldi antenna, the taper is itself the antenna. Horn antennae, like other tapers, are often linear, but the best match is obtained with an exponential curve. The Vivaldi antenna is a flat (slot) version of the exponential taper.[32] Distributed resistance Resistive elements are generally not useful in a distributed-element circuit. However, distributed resistors may be used in attenuators and line terminations. In planar media they can be implemented as a meandering line of high-resistance material, or as a deposited patch of thin-film or thick-film material.[33] In waveguide, A card of microwave absorbent material can be inserted into the waveguide.[34] Circuit blocks Filters and impedance matching Main article: Distributed-element filter Microstrip band-pass hairpin filter (left), followed by a low-pass stub filter Filters are a large percentage of circuits constructed with distributed elements. A wide range of structures are used for constructing them, including stubs, coupled lines and cascaded lines. Variations include interdigital filters, combline filters and hairpin filters. More-recent developments include fractal filters.[35] Many filters are constructed in conjunction with dielectric resonators.[36] As with lumped-element filters, the more elements used, the closer the filter comes to an ideal response; the structure can become quite complex.[37] For simple, narrow-band requirements, a single resonator may suffice (such as a stub or spurline filter).[38] Impedance matching for narrow-band applications is frequently achieved with a single matching stub. However, for wide-band applications the impedance-matching network assumes a filter-like design. The designer prescribes a required frequency response, and designs a filter with that response. The only difference from a standard filter design is that the filter's source and load impedances differ.[39] Power dividers, combiners and directional couplers Main article: Power dividers and directional couplers Microstrip sawtooth directional coupler, a variant of the coupled-lines directional coupler[40] A directional coupler is a four-port device which couples power flowing in one direction from one path to another. Two of the ports are the input and output ports of the main line. A portion of the power entering the input port is coupled to a third port, known as the coupled port. None of the power entering the input port is coupled to the fourth port, usually known as the isolated port. For power flowing in the reverse direction and entering the output port, a reciprocal situation occurs; some power is coupled to the isolated port, but none is coupled to the coupled port.[41] A power divider is often constructed as a directional coupler, with the isolated port permanently terminated in a matched load (making it effectively a three-port device). There is no essential difference between the two devices. The term directional coupler is usually used when the coupling factor (the proportion of power reaching the coupled port) is low, and power divider when the coupling factor is high. A power combiner is simply a power splitter used in reverse. In distributed-element implementations using coupled lines, indirectly coupled lines are more suitable for low-coupling directional couplers; directly-coupled branch line couplers are more suitable for high-coupling power dividers.[42] Distributed-element designs rely on an element length of one-quarter wavelength (or some other length); this will hold true at only one frequency. Simple designs, therefore, have a limited bandwidth over which they will work successfully. Like impedance matching networks, a wide-band design requires multiple sections and the design begins to resemble a filter.[43] Hybrids Hybrid ring, used to produce sum and difference signals A directional coupler which splits power equally between the output and coupled ports (a 3 dB coupler) is called a hybrid.[44] Although "hybrid" originally referred to a hybrid transformer (a lumped device used in telephones), it now has a broader meaning. A widely used distributed-element hybrid which does not use coupled lines is the hybrid ring or rat-race coupler. Each of its four ports is connected to a ring of transmission line at a different point. Waves travel in opposite directions around the ring, setting up standing waves. At some points on the ring, destructive interference results in a null; no power will leave a port set at that point. At other points, constructive interference maximises the power transferred.[45] Another use for a hybrid coupler is to produce the sum and difference of two signals. In the illustration, two input signals are fed into the ports marked 1 and 2. The sum of the two signals appears at the port marked Σ, and the difference at the port marked Δ.[46] In addition to their uses as couplers and power dividers, directional couplers can be used in balanced mixers, frequency discriminators, attenuators, phase shifters, and antenna array feed networks.[47] Circulators A coaxial ferrite circulator operating at 1 GHz Main article: Circulator A circulator is usually a three- or four-port device in which power entering one port is transferred to the next port in rotation, as if round a circle. Power can flow in only one direction around the circle (clockwise or anticlockwise), and no power is transferred to any of the other ports. Most distributed-element circulators are based on ferrite materials.[48] Uses of circulators include as an isolator to protect a transmitter (or other equipment) from damage due to reflections from the antenna, and as a duplexer connecting the antenna, transmitter and receiver of a radio system.[49] An unusual application of a circulator is in a reflection amplifier, where the negative resistance of a Gunn diode is used to reflect back more power than it received. The circulator is used to direct the input and output power flows to separate ports.[50] Passive circuits, both lumped and distributed, are nearly always reciprocal; however, circulators are an exception. There are several equivalent ways to define or represent reciprocity. A convenient one for circuits at microwave frequencies (where distributed-element circuits are used) is in terms of their S-parameters. A reciprocal circuit will have an S-parameter matrix, [S], which is symmetric. From the definition of a circulator, it is clear that this will not be the case, {\displaystyle [S]={\begin{pmatrix}0&amp;0&amp;1\\1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0\end{pmatrix}}} for an ideal three-port circulator, showing that circulators are non-reciprocal by definition. It follows that it is impossible to build a circulator from standard passive components (lumped or distributed). The presence of a ferrite, or some other non-reciprocal material or system, is essential for the device to work.[51] Active components Microstrip circuit with discrete transistors in miniature surface-mount packages, capacitors and resistors in chip form, and biasing filters as distributed elements Distributed elements are usually passive, but most applications will require active components in some role. A microwave hybrid integrated circuit uses distributed elements for many passive components, but active components (such as diodes, transistors, and some passive components) are discrete. The active components may be packaged, or they may be placed on the substrate in chip form without individual packaging to reduce size and eliminate packaging-induced parasitics.[52] Distributed amplifiers consist of a number of amplifying devices (usually FETs), with all their inputs connected via one transmission line and all their outputs via another transmission line. The lengths of the two lines must be equal between each transistor for the circuit to work correctly, and each transistor adds to the output of the amplifier. This is different from a conventional multistage amplifier, where the gain is multiplied by the gain of each stage. Although a distributed amplifier has lower gain than a conventional amplifier with the same number of transistors, it has significantly greater bandwidth. In a conventional amplifier, the bandwidth is reduced by each additional stage; in a distributed amplifier, the overall bandwidth is the same as the bandwidth of a single stage. Distributed amplifiers are used when a single large transistor (or a complex, multi-transistor amplifier) would be too large to treat as a lumped component; the linking transmission lines separate the individual transistors.[53] History See also: Distributed-element filter § History, Waveguide filter § History, and Planar transmission line § History Oliver Heaviside Distributed-element modelling was first used in electrical network analysis by Oliver Heaviside[54] in 1881. Heaviside used it to find a correct description of the behaviour of signals on the transatlantic telegraph cable. Transmission of early transatlantic telegraph had been difficult and slow due to dispersion, an effect which was not well understood at the time. Heaviside's analysis, now known as the telegrapher's equations, identified the problem and suggested[55] methods for overcoming it. It remains the standard analysis of transmission lines.[56] Warren P. Mason was the first to investigate the possibility of distributed-element circuits, and filed a patent[57] in 1927 for a coaxial filter designed by this method. Mason and Sykes published the definitive paper on the method in 1937. Mason was also the first to suggest a distributed-element acoustic filter in his 1927 doctoral thesis, and a distributed-element mechanical filter in a patent[58] filed in 1941. Mason's work was concerned with the coaxial form and other conducting wires, although much of it could also be adapted for waveguide. The acoustic work had come first, and Mason's colleagues in the Bell Labs radio department asked him to assist with coaxial and waveguide filters.[59] Before World War II, there was little demand for distributed-element circuits; the frequencies used for radio transmissions were lower than the point at which distributed elements became advantageous. Lower frequencies had a greater range, a primary consideration for broadcast purposes. These frequencies require long antennae for efficient operation, and this led to work on higher-frequency systems. A key breakthrough was the 1940 introduction of the cavity magnetron which operated in the microwave band and resulted in radar equipment small enough to install in aircraft.[60] A surge in distributed-element filter development followed, filters being an essential component of radars. The signal loss in coaxial components led to the first widespread use of waveguide, extending the filter technology from the coaxial domain into the waveguide domain.[61] The wartime work was mostly unpublished until after the war for security reasons, which made it difficult to ascertain who was responsible for each development. An important centre for this research was the MIT Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab), but work was also done elsewhere in the US and Britain. The Rad Lab work was published[62] by Fano and Lawson.[63] Another wartime development was the hybrid ring. This work was carried out at Bell Labs, and was published[64] after the war by W. A. Tyrrell. Tyrrell describes hybrid rings implemented in waveguide, and analyses them in terms of the well-known waveguide magic tee. Other researchers[65] soon published coaxial versions of this device.[66] George Matthaei led a research group at Stanford Research Institute which included Leo Young and was responsible for many filter designs. Matthaei first described the interdigital filter[67] and the combline filter.[68] The group's work was published[69] in a landmark 1964 book covering the state of distributed-element circuit design at that time, which remained a major reference work for many years.[70] Planar formats began to be used with the invention of stripline by Robert M. Barrett. Although stripline was another wartime invention, its details were not published[71] until 1951. Microstrip, invented in 1952,[72] became a commercial rival of stripline; however, planar formats did not start to become widely used in microwave applications until better dielectric materials became available for the substrates in the 1960s.[73] Another structure which had to wait for better materials was the dielectric resonator. Its advantages (compact size and high quality) were first pointed out[74] by R. D. Richtmeyer in 1939, but materials with good temperature stability were not developed until the 1970s. Dielectric resonator filters are now common in waveguide and transmission line filters.[75] Important theoretical developments included Paul I. Richards' commensurate line theory, which was published[76] in 1948, and Kuroda's identities, a set of transforms which overcame some practical limitations of Richards theory, published[77] by Kuroda in 1955.[78] According to Nathan Cohen, the log-periodic antenna, invented by Raymond DuHamel and Dwight Isbell in 1957, should be considered the first fractal antenna. However, its self-similar nature, and hence its relation to fractals was missed at the time. It is still not usually classed as a fractal antenna. Cohen was the first to explicitly identify the class of fractal antennae after being inspired by a lecture of Benoit Mandelbrot in 1987, but he could not get a paper published until

2 Firm strategy homepage | Your Tomorrow Your Tomorrow is how we’re energizing and digitizing our business. We’re not academic about disruption. We’re embracing it and evolving rapidly so we stay in control of our destiny and secure the firm for today and for many years into the future. Where we are going We want to be the first to bring together -- at scale -- the energy and talent in Assurance, Advisory, Tax and Internal Firm Services with technologies to drive even more quality, greater efficiencies, and deeper insights -- as well as imagine new services -- with four components: Standardize: Before we can get the full benefit of the technology we’re introducing into the firm and our engagements, we need to have a common way of doing things Automate: After we standardize our processes, we’ll automate them. That helps us continue to drive up quality, operate more efficiently and reduce manual work -- a better experience for us and for our clients. Harness data: We want to be known as a firm that's world-class at putting data to work for the benefit of both our clients and the firm. We are building a world-class data platform so it will be faster and easier for us to harness the power of data -- to acquire and work with data more securely and efficiently to drive quality and uncover insights that add value for our clients. Upskill: We can’t digitize the firm without the best technology. And we can’t put technology to work without people who know how to use the tools. We’re not aware of any other organization that is upskilling its people at this scale and speed. This is a two-way commitment: Citizen-led innovation is all of us reimagining the possible and innovating how we deliver quality work each and every day. This starts with Digital Upskilling so we can put technology to work to add quality and value for our clients. Business-led meets citizen-led in the Digital Lab, an online community that will be introduced to the entire firm in November. With Digital Lab, the output of our citizen-led innovation is democratized, with solutions shared between PwCers. It will also be the place where business-led innovations reside so that we can access them in one place. Business-led innovation describes the investments we’re making as a firm in technology, upskilling, tools and processes that can be scaled across our business. ghdgd dddgdfg ddddd dddddd d ddddddddd ddddddd ddddd jjjjjjjjjj dddd Resources Digital Hub Be well, work well Digital Fitness Citizen-led and business-led slides Don't forget about wellness None of this digital upskilling is possible if we are not first taking care of ourselves. Through Be well, work well, we focus on everyday behaviors and habits for fueling energy—proven to help us become and sustain our best selves, both personally and professionally.</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/Test/Subpage.html</url><pwc_title>Shannon's subpage</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-09-24 03:33:07</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title>My subpage</pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title>mySubpage</pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype>news</pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav>true</pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Shannon's subpage Risk Assurance Home | Risk Assurance non-audit resources | Risk Assurance audit support resources Go-to-market resources M&amp;S G-site, including Pursuits Centers of Excellence: • ICRS COE • Risk Assurance COE Smart Pricing RA microsite for managers+ Platforms Navigator Recent webcasts Recent communications Go-to-market resources Lorem ipsum Quick Links FY20 Expectations Guide Career Opportunities L&amp;D Global RA team (GDM) OFRO Podcast Videos</pwc_body></record><record><url>https://hq-stg.pwc.com/test/Test/Test-FS.html</url><pwc_title>Test FS</pwc_title><pwc_modified_date>2019-10-04 01:06:57</pwc_modified_date><pwc_tags></pwc_tags><pwc_page_title>Test FS</pwc_page_title><pwc_nav_title>Test FS</pwc_nav_title><pwc_subtitle></pwc_subtitle><pwc_description></pwc_description><pwc_vanitypath></pwc_vanitypath><pwc_redirectpath></pwc_redirectpath><pwc_hideinsearch></pwc_hideinsearch><pwc_articletype></pwc_articletype><pwc_publication_date></pwc_publication_date><pwc_source></pwc_source><pwc_author></pwc_author><pwc_hideinnav></pwc_hideinnav><pwc_on_time></pwc_on_time><pwc_off_time></pwc_off_time><pwc_headlineimageproxy></pwc_headlineimageproxy><pwc_filereference></pwc_filereference><pwc_redirect_target></pwc_redirect_target><pwc_startdate></pwc_startdate><pwc_enddate></pwc_enddate><pwc_body>Test FS Together we are driving quality, winning work, taking care of each other and making a difference for our communities. Our story begins with who we are and who we are becoming. We are a firm that stands for something: Purpose-led and values-driven Bring our strategy to life We secure the future for our people We are operating in a world of change and complexity. Every action we take is driven by what our clients are telling us they want -- Our strategy is how we respond to what our clients and people are telling us. We’re executing on our goal to make PwC a truly digital organization -- serving our clients even better and learning skills that make us even better prepared for the future. To me, this is a classic win-win. As the firm does better, we each have opportunities to do even better ourselves. 1. This is not a journey with a start and end date. Rather, the ability to change -- fast and at scale -- is vital to succeed. We must all become even more comfortable leading through and embracing change. 2. And, time is of the essence. Competitors see the same risks and opportunities and are nipping at our heels, trying to take our market share. I want to be sure that all of you have a clear understanding of where we are going and the potential for all of us: Teaming across lines/functions, we learn more, expand our relationships, have even greater impact and drive the firm’s growth. There is still work to do moving toward a culture that allows us to drive change at scale. We can’t become a truly digital organization without everyone working together Examples: Platforms, Salesforce, By having a mindset of continuous improvement (including work hacks or anything designed to work more efficiently), we can meet our clients’ expectations for more quality and value at a lower cost -- we stay competitive in an extremely competitive environment. Examples: Simplification, Workday This is how we’re energizing and digitizing our business. We’re not academic about disruption. We’re embracing it and evolving rapidly so we stay in control of our destiny and secure the firm for today and for many years into the future. Since the launch of Your Tomorrow, we have done a lot of the hard work to get in shape and focus on the fundamentals. Now, we’re ready to play for real and up our wellness and digital habits through Your Tomorrow.
