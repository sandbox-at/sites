Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use. Software testing involves the execution of a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. In general, these properties indicate the extent to which the component or system under test: meets the requirements that guided its design and development, responds correctly to all kinds of inputs, performs its functions within an acceptable time, it is sufficiently usable, can be installed and run in its intended environments, and achieves the general result its stakeholders desire. As the number of possible tests for even simple software components is practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select tests that are feasible for the available time and resources. As a result, software testing typically (but not exclusively) attempts to execute a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects). The job of testing is an iterative process as when one bug is fixed, it can illuminate other, deeper bugs, or can even create new ones. Software testing can provide objective, independent information about the quality of software and risk of its failure to users or sponsors.[1] Software testing can be conducted as soon as executable software (even if partially complete) exists. The overall approach to software development often determines when and how testing is conducted. For example, in a phased process, most testing occurs after system requirements have been defined and then implemented in testable programs. In contrast, under an agile approach, requirements, programming, and testing are often done concurrently.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Test image component Jan. 2, 2020 Albatros was the fourth of six Type 23 torpedo boats built for the German Navy (initially called the Reichsmarine and renamed the Kriegsmarine in 1935). Completed in 1927, Albatros often served as a flagship of torpedo boat units. The ship made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. After an attack by aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force killed German sailors in 1937, she participated in the retaliatory bombardment of Almería. At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Albatros helped to lay minefields and made anti-shipping patrols before participating in Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. The ship fired the first shots of the campaign when she encountered and crippled a Norwegian patrol boat. She was lightly damaged during the Battle of Horten Harbor. Albatros then ran aground and was wrecked while maneuvering in an attempt to avoid Norwegian coastal artillery.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Sectors appeared in Connect Jersey, April 2017 Sectors appeared in Con Aerospace and Defense by Pooja Bharathan Jan. 16, 2031 David Carney, PwC - Director, Risk Assurance After four long years of political negotiations and lobbying, the EU agreed the wording of the "General Data Protection Regulation" (GDPR) in December 2015. This will impact every entity that holds or uses European personal data both inside and outside Europe. The GDPR will have a profound effect on how personal data is obtained, processed, stored and disposed of when it’s implemented in May 2018. Significantly, unlike the current regime, the GDPR extends to any organisation located anywhere in the world if your business is offering goods or services into the EU or if you’re capturing personal data on EU citizens, irrespective of whether you’ve a presence in Europe.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Nicole's VN-1129 with thumbnail and hero images the same 300 Madison Office by Nicole Doerrler Jan. 20, 2028 “We are IFS” focuses on inspiring stories from our IFS colleagues. For Learning &amp; Development Manager Edie Egwuonwu, taking well-being to new heights began with giving up her caffeine addiction and steering clear of carbs. Here’s her take on why these steps have led to something big: Becoming more mobile and pain-free. When I joined PwC two years ago, I was heavily addicted to caffeinated soda and rarely drank water. When the Habit Challenge started, I decided to join a “drink water” group. I asked the team for advice on how I could learn to like water again, because after having chemotherapy to treat breast cancer, water tasted like metal to me. Their suggestions and support, combined with tracking and accountability, helped me reach that goal — and I’ve been caffeine-free ever since! After tackling caffeine, I joined an informal team challenge focused on taking 10,000 steps a day. I knew I could not achieve this goal, but I joined the team anyway as something to shoot for. Since I‘m bone-on-bone in both knees due to an injury, resulting in arthritic deterioration, I use a mobility scooter and joked with the team that they should compete against me because they'd surely win! My team cheered me on, and helped inspire me to try and reach my goal of walking again without pain, and without my scooter. A visit to my surgeon brought with it a stark reality: I needed a double-knee replacement, but I weighed too much to undergo surgery. I decided to create a new Habit Challenge team focused on being “carb conscious,” which dovetailed beautifully with my goal to lose weight so I could be a candidate for surgery. To help the cause, I created an internal site to share recipes, ideas and encouragement for anyone at PwC interested in this way of eating. Due to this change in diet, I’m happy to say that, as of this writing, I’ve lost 85 pounds and was approved to have knee surgery later this month! I’m looking forward to being pain-free and dancing with my husband again! I can’t wait to give the 10,000 steps challenge another try post-surgery! Now that I’ve achieved some of my goals, I plan on sticking to my healthy habits and not returning to my old ways. I love being in an environment where wellness is not only encouraged, but pursued at all levels. I credit PwC’s culture and the support of my colleagues for my weight loss and caffeine-free existence! And my medical “numbers” also reflect a much healthier me. There’s so much to look forward to, including more Habit Challenges, and possibly even winning one! Have your own Be well, work well story to share?

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Nicole's test VN-1129 - Hero 2 to 1 aspect ratio 300 Madison Office by Nicole D Jan. 20, 2028 It may seem too frightful to contemplate, but employees are any organization’s top security risk -- even more than hackers and other fraudsters. This isn’t due to malicious intent, but simple avoidable mistakes. And, since the fraudsters out there are continually improving their scams, we’re improving (and simplifying) how we stop them. Check out the new phish button! You’ll see a new “phish” button in your Google Mail side panel when you open an email in Google Mail. (If you don’t see the button, close and reopen Chrome.) Next time you see a suspicious email, simply click the button; you’ll see a pop-up confirmation and PwC’s cybersecurity team will be alerted. On laptop: On Android phone: Flagged emails are automatically deleted, and you may receive additional instructions. This phish button is currently available on your laptop’s Google Mail or the Android Gmail app. If you need to report an email from your iOS device, forward it to GBL_Phishing-Reporting@pwc.com. Even with our sophisticated spam filters, real phishing attacks still get through to our inboxes. One click is all it takes to prevent a malicious link or attachment from compromising our systems and data. Plus, by reporting, you’re automatically entered into our drawing for $100 Amazon gift card (see contest rules). Did you spot that compliance phish? We run periodic tests to help you become better at recognizing phishing emails. Do you remember seeing a notice about a “compliance violation”? More than 10,000 of you did -- and you reported the email! Keep up the good work. Remember, you’re our first line of defense. Don't forget these other tips we've shared during Security Awareness Month: Avoid common social-engineering traps like phishing emails and SMiShing texts. Use VPN all the time (GlobalProtect or PulseSecure) when connecting to WiFi outside the office. Check it twice. Make sure you’re sending from the right email account and have the right recipients and attachments before you hit “send.” Follow the Secure Workspace Policy so you can protect confidential firm and client information wherever you work. Thanks for helping protect our data, our firm, our clients -- and yourself!

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Tax recognition spotlight: 24,000 pounds of food and the giving spirit Tax Nov. 30, 2019 Any act of recognition, big or small, has the power to make someone’s day. Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” We all know how powerful collaboration on-the-ground can be with our clients. At one of our Atlanta-based clients, People &amp; Organization (P&amp;O) Tax and Global Mobility have large, dispersed teams delivering payroll, equity and global mobility services. A recent connectivity event celebrated the strong partnership, with the PwC and client teams co-volunteering at the Atlanta Community Food Bank. Every year, this organization distributes over 60 million meals to more than 755,000 people across metro Atlanta and north Georgia. Together with the client, the PwC teams packaged 24,205 pounds of food — equivalent to about 19,775 meals! It was not only an opportunity to bring the entire xLoS PwC team together, but to expose the client to the broader PwC culture. “While this event was fulfilling in its own right by virtue of everyone being together, it was equally gratifying to be able to show our clients who we are, how much we care about the community and how our mission includes social responsibility,” says Amie Nidoy, P&amp;O Tax Director. Elizabeth Gauf, P&amp;O Tax Manager says, “It was a win-win because PwC and the client share similar values. During the event, the teams were entirely integrated. We were able to strengthen our relationship purely by working together to help others.” As you plan holiday events with clients, consider doing something out of the box — a volunteer event, charity collection, or 5k run to benefit a shared cause. You may find that, like it did for this engagement team, investing in the community together can deepen relationships. (Interested in donating? Visit the Atlanta Community Food Bank giving site.) Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

        <pwc_body>Individual Clients - contracting and obtaining consents and FROR confi Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Individual Clients - contracting and obtaining consents and FROR confirmations One Firm Risk Organization Nov. 25, 2019 As part of our continuous efforts to support the Tax line of service through regular communications, we are calling attention to the following contract language and policies -- Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR), Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information and Privacy Policy Notices. Given the regulatory environment in which we work and the independence issues that could result from a failure to comply with the Tax LOS policy in these areas, it is important that engagement teams working with our individual clients understand and follow the prescribed protocols. The Tax Engagement Compliance Review Program and Office Review Program results have highlighted the need for increased diligence from our teams to include all required language in engagement contracts, obtain the required confirmations from our clients and execute the delivery of services in accordance with our risk management and independence guidance. When contracting with individual clients (including spouses and financially dependent relatives), engagement teams should remember the following: Engagement teams are responsible for ensuring that they do not provide tax services to individuals who are within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523. Providing services to an individual (including spouses and financially dependent relatives) in a FROR at an SEC audit client that is an issuer or at certain related entities of such an audit client is an impermissible service and could result in a reportable independence violation. Create for Tax, the engagement letter creation tool in Engagement Center, contains the templates for individual tax compliance services which includes FROR and Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information language requesting confirmation and consent from the individual client before engaging to provide services. The engagement letter templates used for individual services provides a Privacy Notice that is included with the annual engagement letter as an attachment. Our Privacy Policy provides a better understanding to our clients of our commitment to keeping client personal information confidential. RECOMMENDATION – If you are providing individual tax services and you are not in the PFS practice, be sure to make use of the PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit or preferably, enlist a PFS specialist to assist you through the engagement set-up process. Financial Reporting Oversight Roles (FROR) FROR rules are covered under PCAOB Rule 3523. In summary, a registered public accounting firm is not independent of its audit client if the firm, or any affiliate of the firm, during the audit engagement period, provides any tax service to a person in a FROR at the audit client. The Tax LOS has issued policies and tools in this area to assist engagement teams in obtaining the necessary sign-offs and acknowledgements from their individual clients. Our Review Program results highlight that engagement teams are not consistently obtaining client verification as to whether or not the client(s) is/are in a FROR in the following key areas: Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Corporate Compliance or Consulting contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements for an individual who receives services under the terms of a Family Office Services or Corporate Executive Program contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmations from all individuals for which tax returns are prepared. Engagements performed under a multi-year contract. Such engagements require FROR confirmation annually. AFS approval is required annually if an individual client or an immediate family member of such individual holds a position at a restricted client in order to evaluate if such individual is within the scope of PCAOB Rule 3523 and to consider the effects on auditor independence.See Tip 729: AFS requirements for multi-year contracts Engagements to perform FBAR services for an individual who is an authorized signatory. Such engagements require FROR confirmation (see Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR)). NOTE: All Tax professionals (Associates through Partners) who provide services to individual clients - including PCS, PFS, Law Firm services, IAS, Investment Management and Real Estate practices - are required to take this course in Vantage Financial Reporting Oversight Roles. As a reminder, Tax staff who received a July 1, 2019 promotion have until November 27 to complete the required courses. Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information Section 7216 consent must be obtained for all tax compliance and consulting engagements for individuals due to the nature of our business operations (e.g., use of GDM resources, third party contractors, back office support, etc.) and if the client requests that we disclose the client's tax return information to their representatives or professional advisors (e.g., the client's legal counsel, secretary, head (or CFO) of family office, etc.). This consent must be obtained prior to disclosing information to third parties. The consent must be signed by the client. Please note that the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information must be obtained annually, including in the case of a multi-year contract. Do not reduce the font size of the Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information document below 12 points. This font size is required in order to comply with regulations and procedures under Section 7216. Privacy Policy Notice Tax LOS policy requires that privacy notices be sent to clients when providing individual tax (compliance and consulting) services. The GLBA Privacy Notice must be provided when the client relationship commences. For existing clients, an annual notice must be provided every calendar year. Engagement teams should be sure to use the most current engagement letter templates from Create for Tax. For your reference, below are links to frequently used documents and other helpful sites. Engagement Letters: Tax Compliance: Individuals (also contains the "Consents to Disclosure of Tax Return Information" form) PCS Q&amp;RM Busy Season Toolkit For further information contact any member of the OFRO Tax team or your PCS/PFS Q&amp;RM representative with questions.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Reminder: PTIN renewal due December 2 One Firm Risk Organization Nov. 21, 2019 All PwC Tax personnel required to maintain a PTIN are required to renew their PTIN for the 2020 calendar year, and report their PTIN through the PTIN Confirmation on their My Compliance Dashboard, by Monday, December 2, 2019. The IRS opened the Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) system for 2020 renewals Wednesday, October 16th. The IRS will be sending out renewal notices to all active PTIN holders within the next week indicating that the 2020 PTIN renewal period is now underway. All Tax professionals will also be receiving a PTIN Confirmation through My Compliance Dashboard regarding their 2020 PTIN requirement on October 18, 2019. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN, report your PTIN through the PTIN Confirmation on your My Compliance Dashboard by the due date. The PTIN requirement is a two-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or request an exemption) through the PTIN Confirmation on your My Compliance Dashboard The PTIN requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. New for 2020 renewal season: A data security responsibilities statement and confirmation checkbox has been added to the PTIN renewal application. The statement is an acknowledgment that the PTIN applicant is “aware that paid tax return preparers must have a data security plan in place to provide data and system security protection for all taxpayer information.” To maintain the appropriate degree of confidentiality, privacy and security of taxpayer information, firm personnel must follow the requirements of the Information Protection Principles (the “Principles”). Each individual obtaining or renewing a PTIN should review the Principles for information regarding the firm’s processes for safeguarding taxpayer information and their roles and responsibilities with respect to such processes. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2019 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2019 PTIN before you can renew for 2020. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2020 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year. The firm requires all Tax personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must obtain and report an approved exemption. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit. NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update Ethics &amp; Compliance by sending an email to Ethics &amp; Compliance. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202) 251-4459 or Emily Burgardt at (408) 613-5973.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Use TAS engagement documentation and approval requirements for C2 Provisions One Firm Risk Organization Nov. 14, 2019 Tax Accounting Service (“TAS”) engagements present unique and potentially significant risk to the firm, primarily as a result of the engagement’s relationship to our client’s financial statements. Tax engagement teams should be aware of the importance of documenting our work when performing these services for non-audit clients. Such engagements include the following: Tax provision preparation or review Accounting for uncertain tax positions Tax accounting performance improvement P&amp;O Tax Pension/OPEB valuation, stock-based compensation accounting or deferred tax related services (ASC 712, 715, 718 and/or 740). Teams should also evaluate if the engagement, or aspects of it, should be done as a CMAAS (Capital Markets and Accounting Advisory Services) engagement (see CMAAS- internal leasing presentation). Please consult with your TAS Market Leader. Risk management protocols Because of the risk profile of such engagements, tax engagement teams should be aware of the risk management protocols to help teams mitigate the risks on these engagements. One such protocol requires that all tax accounting service engagements for non-audit clients be approved by a TAS Market Leader or a P&amp;O Tax Accounting Services Leader. In addition, tax accounting service engagements that have been designated as high risk require OFRO Tax approval and the approval and active involvement of a Concurring Partner (“CP”) with tax accounting experience. As a reminder, all non-restricted (C2) Tax provision review/preparation engagements are required to be restricted in DMS (see the Policy: Confidentiality and DMS access). All approvals should be obtained during the engagement acceptance process and prior to the execution of the engagement contract and the commencement of work. Engagement teams should select the characteristics that apply to the engagement when completing the A&amp;C engagement acceptance assessment to ensure the appropriate approvals are obtained during the Engagement Acceptance process. When providing TAS for non-audit clients, the engagement set-up sequence is important… Check restriction in Salesforce first (or Central Entity Service (“CES”)) to determine if client is a non-audit client If a non-audit client, initiate the engagement acceptance assessment in A&amp;C Obtain TAS/P&amp;O Tax leader approval and, if applicable, OFRO Tax and CP approvals Execute engagement contract Begin work Documentation In addition to following the specific risk management protocols for these types of engagements, engagement teams should be sure to include adequate documentation of our work, advice given, assumptions, and our client’s involvement in the engagement files, on a contemporaneous basis (see Documentation policy). Tax engagement teams should obtain a timely Representation Letter or its equivalent (see Policy: Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients) for each deliverable (including one for each interim and year-end provision deliverables) from a client in connection with a tax accounting service engagement. The Representation Letter or its equivalent is intended to memorialize the respective roles and responsibilities of PwC and management, as well as reaffirm management’s responsibility for decisions, judgments and review over the course of the engagement. The Representation Letter is attached to the electronic version of the engagement letter in Create for Tax, or a stand-alone template of the Representation Letter can be found in the C2 Tax Accounting Services toolkit along with a comprehensive list of helpful tools and templates. Our documentation in DMS, either through the use of a Representation Letter or otherwise, should include contemporaneous evidence that the client took responsibility for decisions and judgments and was involved in the review of our work and deliverables. When transmitting deliverables for tax accounting service engagements, the tax engagement team should ensure the deliverables are only transmitted to the client and not, for example, to the client’s auditing firm. If any third party file-sharing websites such as SharePoint, Box or Dropbox are used to transmit deliverables, NIS approval is required, after OFRO Tax approval is received, even if the client is one of the file-sharing sites. To request an exception for a file-sharing website, see https://pwc-spark.com/docs/DOC-1071654. Learn more For additional information regarding tax accounting services for non-audit clients, see the Providing Tax Accounting Services to C2 Clients policy. Please note that there is separate guidance for engagements subject to the policy set forth in section 12370 of the PwC Audit Guide for Accounting Advisory Services to Non-Audit Clients. Need help?

You can also visit the Employee Referral site for an overview of the Employee Referral Program and FAQs. The fine print Referrals made prior to September 1, 2019 are not eligible for this enhanced Employee Referral Program reward, even if the referred individual begins employment with the firm between September 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. Referrals made after June 30, 2020 are also not eligible. Please refer to the Employee Referral Program for the reward amounts available for referrals to other positions. If you have a contractual commitment to a prior employer in effect restricting your ability to aid PwC in recruiting from that employer, you cannot refer potential candidates from that employer. All rewards will be paid less applicable statutory deductions and authorized withholdings. PwC may modify or eliminate this Employee Referral Program promotion at any time without prior notice.

Tax Sept. 3, 2019 New features and integration align your pricing and budgeting. The Smart Pricing Tool (SPT) provides the LIST PRICE for our PwC Tax services. FlexForecast provides the COST to deliver that work to the client. We are calculating PRICE and COST separately — a pricing best practice. The combination of the two maximizes our ability to capture revenue and profitability. This pair were just meant to be! How does the integration work? From within SPT, link your Cart to a FlexForeast engagement Link each cart item to the corresponding budget tab. When you do this, the List Price will flow into FlexForecast as your Target, and, if fixed fee, the Quoted Price will flow in as your Base Fees. All the details on your expected metrics will still be in Flex once you complete your budget against the SPT fee. For details on how to do this, please see this QRC. Also new in FlexForecast, you will notice the Fee Structure options have changed to accurately reflect our progress on our goal to structure 70% of new contracts using alternative fee arrangements. Please refer to the SPT tool and the Tax Pricing Microsite for business unit guidance on preferred and required pricing structures. The Tax Pricing Microsite contains a wealth of information and resources to help you drive our Smart Pricing strategy at the engagement level. Be sure to include the link to your SPT Cart in your FlexForecast comments and/or notes when sending budgets for approval. Effective Sept. 1, any budget under 75% IPR will be routed for leadership approval.

        <pwc_body>Google data retention policy: What it means for Tax Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Google data retention policy: What it means for Tax Tax Sept. 19, 2019 In June, the firm announced a new Google data retention policy: Starting Nov. 1, emails older than 18 months (both Google Mail and Lotus Notes) and My Drive files that have a “last modified” date older than 36 months will be automatically deleted, unless the user is part of an exception group or is subject to an OGC Legal Hold. Files stored in Google Shared Drives (formerly known as Team Drives) will not be subject to automatic deletion. Please read the PwC Inside article and Brian Meighan’s (Tax Quality and Risk Management Leader) message announcing this change and familiarize yourself with the details of this new policy. And, if you haven’t already, start a conversation with your team about putting processes in place for managing data. PwC is moving away from a “keep everything forever” mindset and reinforcing our long-standing policy of maintaining engagement documentation in the appropriate systems of record. What does this mean for me, in Tax? As a general matter, the firm’s data retention policy will apply to all existing emails and My Drive files, including those created before Nov. 1. However, for personnel in the Tax LoS, Google emails and My Drive files created before Nov. 1st will continue to be retained for a period of time. For all emails and My Drive files created on Nov. 1 or thereafter, the Tax LoS will follow the same data retention policy as the rest of the firm (i.e., 18 months retention period for Google emails and 36 months retention period for My Drive files). What can I do to prepare? Reinforce with your engagement teams the importance of retaining documentation in DMS. Review the Tax Documentation policy to understand what should and should not be retained in DMS, and the “Tax Project Folder Index” included in every newly created DMS project folder (see the Administrative sub-folder) for guidance on required and example documents to be filed in DMS. If you haven’t modified a file in 36 months and it lives in your My Drive, it is unlikely that it falls into the category of “must keep.” Our business changes rapidly and, generally speaking, materials that haven’t been refreshed in over three years may not be current and up-to-date. You do not need to worry about losing files if you are updating them regularly, as updating a file will “reset” the last modified date for the retention period. Use the “MySavedEmails(US)” email label for important non-record emails that do not belong in client DMS files, but you have a business need to keep. These emails will not be subject to automatic deletion after 18 months. Read the July PwC Inside article for instructions on how to use this label. The Chief Data Office will be monitoring use of the MySavedEmails label to ensure we, as a firm, are using the label in a manner consistent with our document retention policy. A good baseline is to aim to save less than 5% of your non-record emails. Consider requesting and using Shared Drives (formerly known as Team Drives) for non-record documents. For example, Shared Drives may be used to house templates created by engagement teams, research relevant to general topics (not client-specific), training materials, etc. Access the FAQs for more information on Shared Drives. Consult with your team to make sure you’re following established protocols — or work together to create them as necessary. If your team needs help thinking through and creating the right processes to support your data management needs, please reach out to the Chief Data Office and/or a member of the OFRO Tax team and request a team briefing and consultation. Familiarize yourself with the Documentation Toolkit (one stop shop for documentation related guidance, tools, templates) and review the Tax Documentation policy and US Records Management and Retention policy. If you have not yet downloaded the “File to DMS” button for Google Mail, access this Quick Reference Guide for instructions on how to install and use the button. We all have a responsibility to manage the data lifecycle. It’s up to each of us, on our teams and as individuals, to think critically about what’s important to keep, what’s not and for how long — and to make educated decisions to ensure that what should be kept is managed appropriately.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Tax recognition spotlight: Brent Griffin combines family and giving back Tax Sept. 26, 2019 Any act of recognition, big or small, has the power to make someone’s day. Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you." When it came to his director sabbatical, Brent Griffin really wanted to make it count. His goal was to spend time with his family and disconnect, but also to focus on helping others. And he did — with his two teenage sons, Brent spent a full week giving back in South Charleston, West Virginia as part of an Appalachian mission trip with Heart + Hand Outreach Ministries. They spent several long, hot days working on a home for a wheelchair bound woman, which consisted of excessive landscaping, pressure washing, painting and some repairs to her wheelchair ramp. For Brent, an IAS director based in Indianapolis, taking a 4-week sabbatical was a daunting prospect. However, he found that having the experience allowed him to lean in to his team’s development by providing them stretch opportunities while he was gone. “There’s beauty in planning. It helps you think about your role and helps you understand how to develop your team in your absence. The extent to which I was able to rely on my team while I was out, and develop them in the process, was an incredibly rewarding aspect of my sabbatical.” Brent took away several lessons from his sabbatical. First, there are people around the corner who need help. There’s no need to feel like you can't make a difference — even in a small way. Second, it’s never too early to get your family involved in giving back; for Brent, it made the experience that much richer. Last but not least, he was incredibly thankful to have had such a unique opportunity to step back and recharge at this point in his career. Brent is now inspired to make sure he is spreading the message about the importance of taking time. “After this experience, I’m adamant that my team take advantage of the flexibility the firm offers. If we aren’t embracing it, we are living in contrast to the values we espouse. Embrace Be well work well and communicate your needs.” Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today? ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ How are you progressing against the PwC Professional framework and our One Firm &amp; Tax FY20 Expectations?

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Looking for a timesaver with AFS? Obtain a pre-approval Framework AFS One Firm Risk Organization by Tim Kirk &amp; Amy Kavral Sept. 8, 2019 Tax engagement teams should consider the use of a Framework AFS (Authorisation For Services) that is approved at the beginning of the year after audit committee approval has been received for recurring or known tax services to be provided to the client throughout the year. This can be an effective means of managing the Responsible Partner’s (as identified in CES) pre-approval obligations and can be extremely helpful in achieving compliance with firm policy. As background, many audit clients have a pre-approval Framework Agreement in place, which is an approach used to obtain and document audit committee pre-approval for recurring or known (at the time of preparing the Framework) tax services to be provided to the client during the audit engagement period. For example, tax compliance and tax compliance related services provided annually and other types of detailed, pre-defined tax consulting services, may be included in a client’s Pre-Approval Framework Agreement to obtain Audit Committee pre-approval well in advance of actually engaging to provide the services. In these cases, the Framework AFS can be obtained after Audit Committee pre-approval is granted and should mirror the client’s Pre-approval Framework Agreement’s detailed scope of services for those pre-approved non-audit services. An approved Framework AFS will provide the necessary approvals to “clear the way” for engagement teams to be engaged to provide previously pre-approved tax services as requested by the client. However, care should be used to ensure that the non-audit services that are being provided clearly fall under the Framework AFS. In many cases, the Responsible Partner may still request that a separate AFS also be submitted as each project kicks off for notification/tracking purposes. If a separate AFS is requested, a best practice that should be considered is to also reference the Framework AFS at that time. Tax engagement teams should discuss with the respective Responsible Partner the procedures to be followed to obtain pre-approval for any non-audit services to be provided to their restricted clients and/or their affiliates, including whether a Pre-approval Framework Agreement has been agreed to with the client and the relevant PCAOB Rule 3524 communications have been made. If a Pre-approval Framework Agreement is not being used for your restricted client and/or their affiliate, consider having a discussion with the Responsible Partner regarding the use of a Pre-approval Framework Agreement approach.

Tax Sept. 26, 2019 Specialized Tax Services manager Angela Longway had concerns joining a new team as part of last year’s Talent Movement process. “I was worried about not having all the technical knowledge my peers in the group would have,” she said. “I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to do the work at the level needed.” But participating in Learning &amp; Development prior to joining the team and ongoing team-based learning closed the gap. “I continued to grow my knowledge of what the service offerings are and how we help clients. And I knew I didn’t have to go it alone — that we all wanted this experience to work.” Angela frequently shadowed folks on the team and would take the initiative to read new regulatory information and ask a lot of questions. “I really wanted this experience with a new team and ability to broaden my skills. I had to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable, and that’s made me a more agile employee.” “If you’re considering participating in Talent Movement, just do it! Know you won’t know everything at the start, but it brings new opportunities, and you may find a new area you have a passion for.” And Angela would know — she formally transferred into STS and continues to enjoy where this turn in her career path has taken her. For a limited time — now through October 11 — Tax staff can submit a self-nomination to participate in a tour in one of our Tax BUs. Visit our Talent Movement site for FAQs, info on our BUs and the self-nomination form. We’ll hold a drop-in Q&amp;A webcast on October 3 at 1 p.m. ET. Click here to add to your calendar.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Requests for modifications to standard terms and conditions One Firm Risk Organization by Mike McDermott, Adam Noia, Nayan Bhikha &amp; Jim Emilian Sept. 29, 2019 The engagement contract constitutes the agreement between PwC and the client and is the most effective way to document our mutual understanding of the scope of the engagement, anticipated deliverables, the fees for our services and the terms under which we will perform our services. PwC’s standard contract provisions are incorporated in the engagement letter templates found on the electronic tool "CREATE for Tax," which have been approved by One Firm Risk Organization (OFRO) Tax and Office of General Counsel (OGC). Standard key contract provisions are regularly updated to comply with changes in Firm policy or changes in tax law, regulations and ethical or professional standards. Accordingly, it is important to retrieve the electronic templates when drafting the engagement contract to ensure you are engaging your client under the most recent terms and conditions. Any modifications to the standard terms and conditions in the engagement letter, including changes to the terms and conditions in a Master Services Agreement ("MSA"), Global Master Framework Agreement (“GMFA”), Kovel arrangement, etc., will require the approval of OFRO Tax as part of the A&amp;C Engagement Acceptance Assessment sign-off process. To obtain OFRO Tax approval when necessary, correctly complete the questions in Section 2 of the A&amp;C. In most cases you will need to mark “Yes” to question 2.4 amongst others of the Tax Engagement. Question 2.4 Terms &amp; Conditions Changes (Other than for terms expressly allowed at the engagement partner's discretion pursuant to Contract Guidance for Engagement Teams) AND other than Liability Limits covered above: Are you using a previously negotiated Engagement Letter or MSA that contains nonstandard terms? OR Has the Client requested changes to standard Terms &amp; Conditions? OR Does the Client have a separate Confidentiality Agreement that does not conform to PwC Policy? ◊Yes ◊No Each Engagement Letter or Statement of Work (“SOW”) issued under a recurring services engagement letter, MSA or GMFA that contains nonstandard and/or changes to terms and conditions will require OFRO Tax approval each time on the Tax EAF as part of the engagement set-up process. That is, even if you have received approval from OFRO Tax, Contracting Center of Excellence ("CCoE") and/or OGC in the past for the term modifications (separately as part of a contract negotiation or in a previous Engagement Acceptance Assessment), each engagement stands on its own and requires OFRO Tax approval. Thus, mark this question “Yes.” If you received an approved formal “OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note” from your Regional OFRO Tax Partner for the engagement contract (e.g., an EL, MSA, or GMFA) and none of the exclusions in the exception note apply to your engagement, mark Tax EAF Question 2.4.1 “Yes.” Note: OFRO review and approval of your non-standard engagement contract does not constitute an “OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note.” “OFRO A&amp;C Exception Notes” are not e-mail correspondence, but are formal items issued via a Google Form by Regional OFRO Tax Partners after assessing the nonstandard terms and conditions of the engagement contract and evaluating the incremental risk to the firm for prospective engagements is acceptable. Exceptions should not be requested. If you have not received an “OFRO A&amp;C Exception Note” answer “No” to this question. If the contract (MSA, GMFA, engagement letter, etc.) is amended in any way other than extending its term, the Exception Note immediately expires. Certain provisions in our engagement letters (e.g., Scope of Our Services, Client Responsibilities, etc.) may be modified by engagement teams based on the specific client circumstances without further consultation or OFRO Tax approval. As part of delivering a quality experience, a good reference for Tax engagement teams is the Contract Guidance for the Tax Engagement Letters, which provides guidance for evaluating proposed revisions or exceptions to our standard terms and conditions. It includes guidelines regarding what may be changed, what approvals are required, and provides suggested responses to frequently asked questions. For additional information regarding modifications to engagement letter templates and standard terms and conditions, see the Engagement Terms: Requests for Modifications policy. Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions. Top News About HQ Diversity &amp; inclusion Brand site Independence Compliance Firm Policies pwc.com © 2019 PwC. All rights reserved.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname October 31 resource request deadline quickly approaching — did you submit your schedules and budgets? Tax Sept. 23, 2019 The Tax final submission deadline for FlexForecast budgets for work occurring between January and May for resource deployment purposes is October 31. FlexForecast budgets should be “Sent to Deployment” for all engagements you are 80% sure will be starting in the coming months and where the total contract will exceed 200 hours. The budget should cover the total expected duration of the engagement. Not sure yet what your final scope and fees will be? That’s OK! Only a Draft budget with resource names or “TBDs” and weekly hours is required at this point for purposes of deployment planning, and you’ll be able to update and finalize the budget later. Note that this deadline should not override any market specific deadlines set by your deployment consultant. Here are some tips to make the process efficient: You can copy from prior year budget or actuals. You can download/upload hours changes from Excel directly into FlexForecast budgets. Once you have added all team members to the online budget, the “custom spread” allows you to allocate the timing of hours across the weeks of the project. See these FAQs for more! FlexForecast saves you time and reduces duplication of work because the Draft budget you create now should be the same one your team updates later with your fees, expenses, and resource hours to review the expected economics of your engagement. Please continue to engage your Deployment Consultant, PM Driver, or Tax Finance team with questions or concerns specific to your market and engagement.

        <pwc_body>The importance of restricting access in DMS Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname The importance of restricting access in DMS One Firm Risk Organization by Karen Jones &amp; Ed Hoffstetter Sept. 19, 2019 Protecting client, personal and firm information Maintaining the confidentiality of client information while that information is stored in the DMS is an important part of providing quality services to our clients. PwC has an obligation to our clients to protect their confidential information from access by third parties, but also to limit the number of PwC employees with access to that information. We should share client information with others within the firm only when the access is necessary to perform services for which we have been engaged (i.e., "need to know"). Although DMS has functionality such that personnel can be given access to all Jobs and Projects performed for a client ("broad client file access" or "client level access"), most personnel do not need and should not receive broad client file access or client level access. Rather, as stated in the PwC policy on "Confidentiality and DMS Access," personnel who do not have a client level "need to know" should be granted restricted access. Access levels In general, partners, managing directors, directors and managers (collectively, "managerial personnel") who have a client level "need to know" (regardless of their geographic location) may be granted client level access. Managerial personnel that do not have a client level "need to know" should be granted restricted access. Seniors, associates, and non-managerial personnel (collectively, "non-managerial personnel") should not be given client level access unless they are day-to-day members of the "lead client engagement team" and have a client level "need to know." Accordingly, restricted access should be granted for such non-managerial personnel. Example ABC Inc. is a client of the Boston office. Partner 1, Manager 1 and Senior Associate 1 are involved in several engagements on this client, are the day-to-day "lead client engagement team" members and have a client level "need to know." Several senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office are assisting with a tax return preparation engagement on this client. The senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office are not working on other engagements for this client and therefore do not have a client level "need to know." Client level access should be granted to Partner 1, Manager 1 and Senior Associate 1 because they are the day-to-day members of the "lead client engagement team" with a client level "need to know." The senior associates and associates from the Atlanta office should be given restricted access to the tax return preparation job/project they are working on. If the Atlanta office personnel need access to information maintained in other job/projects for that client, the lead engagement team member can move the relevant information to the appropriate job/project, or the Tax Engagement Partner can grant client level access to the appropriate Atlanta personnel for a short/limited period of time. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ TIP: Be sure to distinguish between multi-year contracts and multi-year engagements: multi-year contracts - should have a separate DMS Job or Project, depending on which level makes sense for the engagement. multi-year engagements - do not need to set up a separate DMS Job or Project. Similarly, multi-phase projects do not require a separate DMS Job or Project. However, the team may find that they want to set up a DMS Job for the engagement so they can set up a separate DMS Project for year phase if it makes organizing the documentation easier for the team (see Tax File Standard). ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Marking a folder restricted Within DMS, select the Subclient, Job or Project. Select PwC &gt; Security &gt; Mark Restricted See Marking and Unmarking a Subclient, Job or Project Restricted for detailed examples. To learn how to restrict and monitor DMS access, read the PwC policy on Confidentiality and DMS Access. For additional information on Tax “Data security, confidentiality and your responsibility” visit the OFRO Tax site. If you become aware of or suspect a situation where information has or could become lost, please immediately report it to the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS).

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname A framework AFS could save you time in 2020 Tax Dec. 8, 2019 Have you considered using a framework AFS (Authorisation For Services) for recurring or known tax services to be provided to the client throughout the year? A framework AFS is approved at the beginning of the year after audit committee approval has been received, and is an effective way to manage the Responsible Partner’s (as identified in CES) pre-approval obligations and in achieving compliance with firm policy. Many audit clients have a pre-approval framework agreement in place, which is an approach used to obtain and document audit committee pre-approval for recurring or known (at the time of preparing the framework) tax services to be provided to the client during the audit engagement period. For example, tax compliance and tax compliance related services provided annually and other types of detailed, pre-defined tax consulting services, may be included in a client’s pre-approval framework agreement to obtain audit committee pre-approval well in advance of actually engaging to provide the services. If a pre-approval framework agreement is not yet being used for your restricted client and/or their affiliate, consider having a discussion with the Responsible Partner about using this approach. Please note: starting December 2, we will no longer provide certain permissible non-audit services to SEC-issuer audit clients. Click this link to read more about this change. Ready to get started? Start your AFS here and include in the Scope the recurring or known (at the time of preparing the Framework) tax services to be provided to the client during the audit engagement period. Questions? For additional information, see the pre-approval framework agreements and Independence section on the Tax Independence site or contact timothy.s.kirk@pwc.com, mike.mcdermott@pwc.com or amy.kavral@pwc.com.

Be ready to talk fixed fees Tax Dec. 11, 2019 Trying to convert your engagement to a fixed-fee or other Alternative Fee Arrangement? Start the conversation with a focus on value. And the earlier you begin these discussions, the more likely it is that you’ll be successful, and enhance the client relationship in the process. Just ask Partner Steve Bybee. He and his International Tax Services team were facing a competitive bid. Although they had years of history with the client, the work had always been on a rates-and-hours basis. About a year before the official RFP was issued, they started laying the groundwork — meeting with the Pricing Help Desk to develop an approach that would make sense for this client, and starting conversations with the client about the value they were looking for, and how PwC could deliver that with an alternative fee arrangements. Since they had significant history with the client, Steve and his team didn’t try to simply match the competitor’s low fees in a race to the bottom. Instead, they focused on the value they would deliver and introduced technology into the engagement to drive performance and efficiency. The client was very impressed with this approach. The team focused on clarifying the engagement scope, and stressed the discipline it would take from all of the PwC teams involved to deliver what was agreed to within the parameters of the fixed-fee arrangement. “It was important for us to have a clear goal, and then the buy-in from each of our partners.” Partner Steve Bybee Keeping lines of communication open ensured everyone was on the same page about the scope and pricing strategy. As a result, they were able to focus on bringing value and give the client options. Your team can do this, too.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Two holiday gifts from your friends in ITS and TP Dec. 18, 2019 Staying informed on the latest information and opportunities for your clients can be challenging, but luckily your friends in International Tax Services and Transfer Pricing have two offerings just for you: Introducing the (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) BEPS 2.0 Analytic Tool In response to the transformative global tax environment surrounding the OECD’s latest initiative on digital (commonly referred to as BEPS 2.0), we now have a tool to assist our clients in better understanding the potential impact of such proposals on their varying business models. The Analytic provides an illustrative impact analysis based on client CbCR data (either XML or Excel) and can be run by engagement teams in a matter of minutes. Our speed of market is a competitive advantage and allows us to quickly engage with our clients. Reach out to your ITS and TP colleagues and visit the Tax Source content page on BEPS 2.0 for additional background, supporting instructions, materials and resources for this opportunity. Section 965 Calculation &amp; Documentation 0pportunity The IRS updated its website on November 4, indicating that it has added review of Section 965 liabilities reported on 2017 and 2018 tax returns to the Large Business &amp; International (LB&amp;I) active campaign list. This suggests continued scrutiny of Section 965 going forward, which means we may be able to assist clients in recalculation of the Section 965 liability and preparation of audit-ready documentation (including the use of statistical sampling). These two offerings are not mutually exclusive, and are also good opportunities to collaborate with Quantitative Solutions and Technology (QST), National Economics and Statistics (NES, Statistical Sampling), Special Tax Services (STS), and Tax Accounting Services (TAS) to support the ITS tax technical review and analysis.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Don't forget: PTIN renewals due today, Dec 2 One Firm Risk Organization Dec. 4, 2019 All PwC Tax personnel required to maintain a PTIN are required to renew their PTIN for the 2020 calendar year, and report their PTIN through the PTIN Confirmation on their My Compliance Dashboard, by Monday, Dec. 2, 2019. The IRS opened the Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) system for 2020 renewals Wednesday, October 16. The IRS will be sending out renewal notices to all active PTIN holders within the next week indicating that the 2020 PTIN renewal period is now underway. All Tax professionals will also be receiving a PTIN Confirmation through My Compliance Dashboard regarding their 2020 PTIN requirement on Oct. 18, 2019. You can access the IRS' PTIN webpage www.irs.gov/ptin to complete your PTIN renewal or obtain your PTIN for the first time. After renewing or obtaining your PTIN, report your PTIN through the PTIN Confirmation on your My Compliance Dashboard by the due date. The PTIN requirement is a two-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or request an exemption) through the PTIN Confirmation on your My Compliance Dashboard The PTIN requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. New for 2020 renewal season: A data security responsibilities statement and confirmation checkbox has been added to the PTIN renewal application. The statement is an acknowledgment that the PTIN applicant is “aware that paid tax return preparers must have a data security plan in place to provide data and system security protection for all taxpayer information.” To maintain the appropriate degree of confidentiality, privacy and security of taxpayer information, firm personnel must follow the requirements of the Information Protection Principles (the “Principles”). Each individual obtaining or renewing a PTIN should review the Principles for information regarding the firm’s processes for safeguarding taxpayer information and their roles and responsibilities with respect to such processes. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2019 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2019 PTIN before you can renew for 2020. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2020 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year. The firm requires all Tax personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must obtain and report an approved exemption. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit. NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update Ethics &amp; Compliance by sending an email to Ethics &amp; Compliance.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname You have a multi-year contract with a client - follow this AFS process step Tax Dec. 12, 2019 It’s the responsibility of each engagement team to identify whether an engagement is being performed under a multi-year contract and if so, to comply with the Authorisation for Services (AFS) requirements applicable to that multi-year contract (see Independence Section 4060.11). There is a difference between a multi-year contract and an engagement expected to extend more than 12 months. A multi-year contract is a contract for a series of separate and distinct identifiable services that will be performed over a period that runs beyond a single calendar year/12 month period (e.g., a tax compliance engagement contract for the preparation of the current year’s tax returns and two years thereafter or a recurring consulting engagement contract with a term of three years). An engagement expected to extend more than 12 months is a single identifiable service (e.g., a tax refund claim that will take 18-24 months to complete or a consulting engagement which will last more than 12 months). This is not a multi-year contract for purposes of this guidance. How to answer the “Recurring Multi-year Contract” question in your AFS: Under the firm’s AFS policy, engagement teams should prepare an AFS for each year/12 month period of a multi-year contract. Engagement teams are not required to create an additional AFS for an engagement expected to extend more than 12 months. (See New AFS- Frequently Asked Questions) When creating an AFS for a multi-year contract, answer “Yes” for the Recurring Multi-year Contract question in the Description of Service section. In addition, note the required delivery completion date - as agreed to in the multi-year contract - in the appropriate sections of the Details section. Answering “Yes” will prompt the AFS system to generate an AFS renewal reminder notification to the AFS Owner, Service Engagement Leader and Global Relationship Partner (if included in the original AFS). (See Salesforce Notifications for AFS - “Renewal Reminder for Recurring AFS”). The notification will request that the team complete a new AFS each and every year to obtain authorization to perform the next year’s services. Note: The team should timely complete and receive approval for each new AFS before beginning the next year’s services. When creating an AFS for an engagement expected to extend more than 12 months, answer “No” for the Recurring Multi-year Contract question in the Description of Service section. In addition, note the delivery completion date using your best estimate of when the services will be completed. Teams need only to complete one AFS for an engagement expected to extend more than 12 months, unless a significant change in the original scope warrants completion of a new AFS. In the event of a scope change, teams should consult with the Responsible Partner listed in CES to determine whether the change was considered and approved in the original AFS request or whether a new AFS is required. Remember, it is the responsibility of the engagement team to monitor any changes in scope and identify whether a new AFS request could be required for any new/additional services that were not approved in the original AFS request. Do I need multiple Engagement Acceptance Assessments? An Engagement Acceptance Assessment Form (EAF- informally known as an “A&amp;C”) should be completed for each distinct project every year, including one for each year under a multi-year contract. For an engagement expected to extend more than 12 months, you need only complete one EAF unless the scope significantly changes to warrant a new AFS, and consequently, a new EAF (see the Engagement Acceptance policy). Complying with our independence requirements — including identifying and obtaining the appropriate approvals for multi-year contracts — requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. For further guidance see: “Helping you maintain Independence in fact and appearance: Providing non-audit services to our clients.” For further information contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

Our next Tax Infinite Learning Day is January 10. Thanks to your feedback in our recent survey, you will see several improvements to your Tax Infinite Learning Day experience going forward: You asked for flexibility: Have critical commitments on January 10? Work with your Relationship Leader and team to designate a different day that you can dedicate to learning. You asked for help scheduling: A hold for Infinite Learning Day has been added to your calendar. Feel free to move the date if your team has picked a different day.

I look forward to hearing your stories of team collaboration in the follow-up survey we’ll send to you in January. What to expect on January 10 Every team’s experience of Infinite Learning Day can and should be different — but here’s one way you might design your day: Prepare. To prepare, review your Tax Development Path and work with your Relationship Leader to identify trainings that support your goals and development priorities. Collaborate. Get together with your team on the morning of, or before, January 10 to plan what you’ll learn as a team and which learning opportunities you’ll pursue. Explore.

If possible, grab lunch or coffee with your team during the day to discuss insights, ideas and challenges that arise during your learning experience. Make it practical. Consider your everyday work and challenges in the context of your training. How can new solutions, tools or ways of thinking enhance the work you do as a team and how you deliver to clients?

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Roy Weathers: Tax Q1 update Tax Oct. 22, 2019 Team: As I reflect on the first quarter, I want to pause and acknowledge how much you do for our practice — and I’m not alone in wanting to say “thank you,” as you’ll see in this short video. You inspire me with your willingness to learn new skills and technologies, and by challenging us to work in new ways. You are leading through change and paving the way for a bright future full of opportunity. In just over a year, we’ve changed how we price, staff and deliver our engagements, and how we use the capacity gained in Project 5 Million to further invest in you and our client relationships. We’ve digitized a total of 3.87 million hours gross since April 2018, and are closing in our P5M goal. These are amazing accomplishments, and it’s the groundwork we need for taking the next step on our journey. Growth has always been at the heart of our P5M vision, and we are focused on driving exponential growth for the Tax practice in FY20. You’ll be hearing more about this, because everyone has a part to play when it comes to building the skills needed to win in a competitive market. You can start by familiarizing yourself with the tools and resources below. Finally, I’d like to congratulate the following Tax partners who have taken on new roles to help drive our firm’s strategic agenda in FY20.

Tax Oct. 28, 2019 Google data retention Starting Nov. 1, emails older than 18 months (both Google Mail and Lotus Notes) and My Drive files that have a “last modified” date older than 36 months will be automatically deleted, unless the user is subject to an OGC Legal Hold. Files stored in Google Shared Drives (formerly known as Team Drives) will not be subject to automatic deletion. As a general matter, the firm’s data retention policy will apply to all existing emails and My Drive files, including those created before Nov. 1. However, for personnel in the Tax LoS, Google emails and My Drive files created before Nov. 1 will continue to be retained for a period of time. Get additional details here and in Brian Meighan’s (Tax Quality and Risk Management Leader) message announcing this change. Familiarize yourself with the details of this new policy and, if you haven’t already, start a conversation with your team about putting processes in place for managing data. Lotus Notes We’re sunsetting Lotus Notes. For Tax, the remaining mail archive will be kept for a short period of time. However, the same firmwide retention rules will be applicable for the current Notes mailbox. Get additional details here. Removable device policy Are you using a USB or external hard drive with your PwC laptop? As of Nov. 7, our firmwide policy is changing: You’ll no longer be able to retrieve files from removable media. If you’re using encrypted devices to retrieve files, copy them over to your laptop prior to the implementation — otherwise, you will no longer be able to read from them. Get additional details for Tax here. We all have a responsibility to manage the data lifecycle. It’s up to each of us, on our teams and as individuals, to think critically about what’s important to keep, what’s not and for how long — and to make educated decisions to ensure that what should be kept is managed appropriately.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Talent Movement moves us forward: A partner perspective Tax Oct. 9, 2019 Within our Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) group, there’s a growing sub-group specializing in partnerships. A year ago, the need to expand the group conveniently lined up with our Talent Movement process, which meant two staff — an experienced manager and an experienced senior associate — were placed with the team. “It was extremely helpful for us in building out our group, and we were able to help staff looking to learn something different,” said M&amp;A Partner Jennifer Wyatt. “We all knew going in that there would be a steep learning curve, but everyone jumped in motivated from day one. We were able to take on a large project we wouldn’t have been able to otherwise, and the staff also brought new non-technical skills into the team.” The experience made Jennifer consider other non-technical skills the whole team could benefit from. “It wasn’t an aspect of Talent Movement I had thought of: the effort and eagerness and fresh perspective coming into the team. It’s more beneficial than just a headcount increase — this is exposure to new skills and viewpoints, and we all grow from that.” Another benefit Jennifer highlights is the investment in keeping our people at PwC. “As partners, we get to participate in a program that comes with a smooth process, that allows staff to move to an area that could tee them up for more success, and keeps good talent in the firm.” “If our staff find a new team that challenges them, we’re all better off. And we owe it to our people to help them find those experiences.” For a limited time — now through October 11 — Tax staff can submit a self-nomination to participate in a tour in one of our Tax BUs. Visit our Talent Movement site for FAQs, info on our BUs and the self-nomination form.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname The importance of encrypting confidential information for Tax One Firm Risk Organization by Ed Hoffstetter &amp; Karen Jones Oct. 31, 2019 Protecting client, personal and firm information This Tax Tip focuses on the importance of sharing client and firm data in a secure manner. Tax client confidential information, including Regulated Private Information (RPI), must be encrypted when transmitted outside the PwC secure network. All PwC Tax partners and staff are required to encrypt any confidential information that is transmitted, exchanged or stored using any of the following mechanisms: Email NOTE: The firm no longer permits transferring data from firm issued PCs to external USBs, external hard drives or other removable media devices (read more). See 3 upcoming changes to how we retain data in Tax To prevent Tax data compromise, when sharing confidential information, use one of the firm's approved information encryption methods. NOTE: the use of Engagement Center, or webDMS, or MFT2GO-West (read more) for sharing documents with Tax clients ensures those documents are automatically encrypted. Which encryption method should I use? Encrypt Microsoft Office documents, when applicable. Apply encryption to Adobe documents to restrict their opening as well as limiting functions such as printing and editing. (Note: this option is only available in Adobe Standard or Professional, not Adobe Reader.) Use WinZip to compress and encrypt multiple files using one password. When applicable: Use ZipMail to encrypt file attachments in Lotus Notes email. Remember: Encryption passwords must be shared separately, and never in the same email as the encrypted attachment. For detailed step-by-step instructions for each of these methods click here for a copy of the PDF document Encryption Guidance, or visit the Information Protection-US Spark site: Email encryption, or call the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS) for instructions on encrypting. For more information regarding safeguarding information please visit the OFRO Tax microsite or contact a member of the OFRO Tax team. If you become aware of or suspect a situation where information has or could become lost, please immediately report it to the Ethics &amp; Compliance HelpLine (1-888-4-ETHICS).

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Using external file storage? It won’t be supported as of Nov. 7 Tax Oct. 24, 2019 Are you using a USB or external hard drive with your PwC laptop? As of Nov. 7, our firmwide policy is changing: You’ll no longer be able to retrieve files from removable media. If you’re using encrypted devices to retrieve files, copy them over to your laptop prior to the implementation — otherwise, you will no longer be able to read from them. Protection of confidential data is part of having a disciplined, One Firm approach to how we provision, store, secure, use, expose and access confidential data. This change is intended to better safeguard firm and client confidential data, and the timing of this policy allows us to get this change into effect prior to firmwide busy season dates. How do I request an exception? Most of us already use one of the firm’s secure data transmittal and collaboration tools. However, if you have a valid business case that requires use of removable media and cannot leverage any of our collaboration tools, please complete this short form to request an exception. It may take up to four business days to grant an exception so please plan ahead. Learn more about the exception request process. In Tax, if you have an existing exception to use removable media, you should have received an email earlier this month to confirm if this exception is still required. If you haven’t already, please follow the steps outlined in that email to confirm. For those who confirm that an exception is still required, this policy change will not affect your ability to retrieve from or save files into removable media. Reminders Don’t forget our new data retention policy goes into effect Nov. 1! Make sure you understand the new data retention policy and the implications for Tax. We’re sunsetting Lotus Notes. For Tax, the remaining mail archive will be kept for a period of time. However, the same firmwide retention rules will be applicable for the current Notes mailbox. Please read additional details here. Questions? Visit PwC’s Service Hub for technology help and resources.

        <pwc_body>The 2019 PCS Year-End Planning Toolkit is now available! Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname The 2019 PCS Year-End Planning Toolkit is now available! Tax Oct. 30, 2019 We've created the PCS Year-End Planning Toolkit (Business and Individual) in the spirit of facilitating meaningful year-end 2019 planning conversations with clients. The toolkit has been designed to highlight opportunities and emerging issues in an effort to help you identify those matters that are most relevant to your clients. There is an expectation that you have year-end planning discussions with 100% of your clients. We encourage you to have these discussions by Friday, December 13, 2019, well in advance of the holidays and year-end. To maximize your impact: Review the toolkit to determine which topics match the varying needs of your clients. You will get more interaction if you customize the meeting agenda so it is specific to each client. Pay special attention to tax reform developments and opportunities. Consider involving specialists in your year-end planning discussions with clients and in the execution of engagements. This toolkit contains issues and opportunities that can be very complex, and it is advisable to seek the assistance of a subject matter professional. Be sure to leverage the team based learning tools as well. Schedule client time to meet and listen. Share insights on the current tax environment, validate goals, and co-develop an approach to identifying new opportunities. Leverage technology (e.g., demos and visualizations) to make conversations come alive. Before you leave, take advantage of your face-to-face time and schedule a follow-up meeting. Be sure to track all of your year-end meetings in Salesforce, and use project plans and other resources and tools in Engagement Center to help in the delivery of new work. Make sure your clients view our year-end planning webcast on Wednesday, December 11, 2019, 2:00 pm - 3:30 pm CT. See the 'Sales Tools' section of the toolkit to register. If you have any questions about the toolkit, or our year-end focus, please reach out to Joe Gomez, PCS Toolkit Partner Champion, Lauren Dettloff, PCS Marketing and Sales Director, or Reed Sands, NTS Tax Knowledge Management Director.

        <pwc_body>Managing “scope creep” – engagement team responsibilities Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Managing “scope creep” – engagement team responsibilities One Firm Risk Organization by Tim Kirk &amp; Amy Kavral Oct. 10, 2019 It is the responsibility of everyone on the engagement team to be aware of the scope of the services we have been engaged to perform for the client and the terms under which we will provide them. In situations where our clients ask us to perform additional services or our services begin to expand (i.e., beyond those we were originally engaged to provide), judgment is required to evaluate whether the additional services represent a substantive change in the nature or scope of services (i.e., “scope creep”) warranting additional approvals. Tax engagement teams should monitor the nature or scope of services provided as their engagements progress, to ensure that the scope does not exceed what was pre-approved by the audit committee (if applicable) and approved by the Responsible Partner listed in the Central Entity Service ("CES") database through the Authorisation For Services ("AFS") process. Engagement teams should be proactive and discuss additional scope requests with the client and the CES Responsible Partner before performing any additional work. If the nature or scope of services changes or exceeds what has been approved in the original AFS, an additional AFS approval must be obtained from the CES Responsible Partner prior to being engaged to provide or performing the additional services. (Note, when providing certain services, you may also need to obtain AFS approval from a Secondary Independence Reviewer – see link for more information. With the new AFS system, an “Independence Specialist” will be added for you as the secondary approver, if applicable). Additionally, discuss with the CES Responsible Partner to understand whether additional pre-approval by the audit committee is required. Examples of changes in the nature or scope of services requiring an additional AFS (and potentially additional audit committee pre-approval) may include: A change in the nature of the work requested - for example, changing a compliance engagement to include consulting services, Changes in the facts and circumstances that may impact the evaluation of threats to independence (including those that impact materiality considerations), Changes in client management that impacts its ability to perform its proper management responsibilities, Change such that the service is now being provided to a different affiliate(s). Complying with our independence requirements, including identifying and obtaining the appropriate approvals for “scope creep,” requires the attention of all engagement team members, working together to facilitate compliance. For additional information regarding “scope creep,” see the Independence Policy, Section 4060.12 Scope “Creep.” Contact any member of the OFRO Tax team with questions.

Remember that transfers are available throughout the year on Workday, and staying connected with your development team on your interests is a great way to help us support your journey as a PwC Professional. What can taking on a new opportunity look like? Tax manager Joel Rogers shares his experience: “In 2015, I was working in Birmingham, Alabama, mostly focused on one client. When we were done with that client, I had a massive hole in my schedule,” said Joel. “ I talked to my development team and mentioned I’d be open to opportunities somewhere else.” Joel moved to New York to work with the Investment Management group for a tour — and has been there ever since after officially transferring. “It was a big change from working corporations to working with partnerships, but my new team were great and helped me get up to speed. This has been a great move for my career and it wouldn’t have happened without the tour.” “There are so many opportunities here at PwC.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Tax recognition spotlight: Supporting a friend after Hurricane Dorian Tax Oct. 24, 2019 Any act of recognition, big or small, has the power to make someone’s day. Each month we’ll recognize a group or member of our Tax practice for living our values and inspiring us to say “thank you.” On September 1, the eye of Hurricane Dorian made landfall on the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas. With winds of 185 mph, it was the strongest hurricane on record. As Hurricane Dorian was approaching landfall, Jenn Babinec, an ITP director based in Tampa, casually reached out to Lexie Bond, ITP partner based in Miami, to check in. Lexie’s family lived on Abaco in the Bahamas for 13 years, and she lived there herself before coming to the US. Lexie’s oldest and dearest friend, Mandi, still lived there with her husband and two young children. Over the weekend when Dorian hit, Jenn took a vested interest. Mandi and her family lived their worst nightmare and were thankful to be alive with their health, but not much else. Luckily, Mandi’s family was able to evacuate four days after the storm passed and arrived at Lexie’s home with a few small bags of belongings. Two days later, four boxes of clothes and accessories showed up at Lexie’s home. Jenn had organized a relief effort in her community and circle of friends to collect clothes and personal items for Mandi and her family. It didn't stop there —- over the next few weeks, Jenn sent four more boxes and gathered almost $1,000 in cash and gift card donations. “Not only was Jenn so caring and selfless to organize the initial collection, she continued to coordinate and project manage the effort. It didn't just happen one time...it happened for weeks. She just kept accumulating things to donate,” said Lexie. For Jenn, “We all have so much, it felt like nothing. It was amazing to see so many people come together for this. My kids, especially, took so much away from the experience. They were so excited to help, to go through the bags of clothes —- for them, it opened their eyes to giving back.” It’s inspiring stories like these that remind us how special our PwC relationships are: For so many, our PwC colleagues are like family, ready to jump in at a moment’s notice to help in a time of need. Whether it’s a cup of coffee, an email, a call, a visit to our Real-time Recognition site, or another preferred way to say thanks...who are you going to recognize today?

        <pwc_body>Reportable transactions deadline - Oct 31 Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Reportable transactions deadline - Oct 31 One Firm Risk Organization by Karen Jones &amp; Nick Nebolsine Oct. 6, 2019 The next material advisor registration deadline is October 31, 2019. If you believe that PwC may be a material advisor for a reportable transaction that a client entered into between July 1, 2019, and September 30, 2019, you should contact Nicholas Nebolsine (571-332-9690) or Karen Jones (703-622-8971) immediately to determine whether registration is required. The five categories of reportable transactions are: listed transactions (including transactions substantially similar to a listed transaction), confidential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, Section 165 loss transactions (including Section 988 losses), and transactions of interest (including transactions substantially similar to a transaction of interest). Section 165 loss transactions, which include Section 988 loss transactions, are the most common type of reportable transaction. Generally, the threshold amount for a Section 165 loss is $10 million in a single year for corporations and partnerships with only corporate partners and $2 million for all other partnerships, S corporations, and individuals. Reportable losses include losses resulting from check-the-box elections and taxable liquidations, worthless stock deductions, losses incurred by a taxpayer's CFC, and sale of assets and subsidiaries. There are some exceptions to these rules, but the exceptions are narrow. For instance, the qualifying basis exception never applies to when the disposed asset is a partnership interest. Further, our material advisor registration and list maintenance obligations may start before a client's related disclosure obligation. PwC may be a material advisor if we receive or expect to receive more than $250,000 in fees and expenses ($50,000 if more than 70% of the tax benefits go to an individual including via a partnership or S corporations) on an engagement that resulted in or is expected to result in a reportable transaction. Unsure whether the transaction is a reportable transaction? Refer to the resources posted in the Reportable Transaction Toolkit or contact an RTDA specialist, such as Ruth Perez (703-963-5641) for assistance. PwC policy requires that all tax professionals take the following steps to ensure that we identify reportable transactions where we are a material advisor and that we timely register those transactions: Step 1 – Evaluate: As part of engagement assessment (A&amp;C), engagement teams should evaluate whether they believe that the engagement will involve a reportable transaction. Step 2 – Re-evaluate: As an engagement is being performed, engagement teams should re-evaluate whether the engagement involves a reportable transaction. The Engagement Checklist may be used for this purpose. Step 3 – Consult: Engagement teams should consult with OFRO Tax immediately if there is a possibility that we may be a material advisor. PwC is a material advisor if (i) the tax advice engagement involves a reportable transaction and (ii) the material advisor fee threshold is satisfied. Step 4 – Certify: All tax partners must certify annually that they have complied with the firm’s policy regarding reportable transactions.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Smart Pricing creates win-win opportunities in the market Tax Oct. 17, 2019 Want to improve engagement financials and deliver more value for clients? Partner Tov Haueisen and his team are doing just that by embracing Smart Pricing — converting to fixed fee and adding a contingent fee to compliance engagements for their non-audit clients. Converting VDA engagements to fixed-fee pricing Before Smart Pricing, Tov Haueisen and his team priced their Voluntary Disclosure Agreements (VDAs) using a rates and hours pricing structure with a not-to-exceed fee cap. But they recognized the burning platform for Smart Pricing in a Project 5 Million environment. Seeing how digitization would lead to reduced hours, they knew that a rates and hours pricing structure -- especially one with a fee cap -- would not be sustainable. “It was more about convincing ourselves than the client,” said Tov. “We needed to get out of our comfort zone, and make sure we were billing for value, efficiencies, and the technology-enabled service we were delivering.” Tov Haueisen So, they worked as a team to raise their pricing and value acumen, convert to fixed-fee, and use the Smart Pricing Tool.In the end, it wasn’t a hard sell. The client appreciated how fixed-fee pricing took out variability and reduced risk. And the results have been impressive -- with fixed-fee pricing contributing to both increased margin (by 25%) and revenue growth. One recent VDA, which started as a small $30K project, is now evolving into a ~$300K fixed-fee engagement, thanks to the additional value the PwC team was able to drive for the client and the way the team has structured the engagement. By converting to fixed free and taking the extra step to frame the value for the client, the team was also able to open doors for additional work with the client. “Not only are we in a better position financially, but the client is happier, too,” said Tov. Compliance paired with a contingent fee review For their compliance work, Tov’s team wanted to be more effective in meeting or exceeding margins. So, they paired refund review services on a contingency basis with their compliance work. Reviewing prior year returns also presented an opportunity to better understand the client and deliver even more value. And they’re already seeing results. “On the last two engagements we’ve worked on we’ve seen our margins go up over 30%,” said Tov, “With both approaches, we’ve created a win-win and look forward to continuing to bring these solutions to future engagements. An important note on contingent fee arrangements Please remember that these examples and pricing recommendations don’t alter our existing Risk Management (RM) and US independence policies (USIP), particularly as it relates to contingent fees, value based fees, discretionary fees and phased engagements with restricted entities, as well as contingent fees for all Tax engagements. There are also unique requirements for audit/attest engagements which must be adhered to. Please refer to the relevant Risk Management policies and sections of USIP and OFRO Pricing guide for further details, or reach out to an OFRO - Independence or RM representative with any specific questions relating to these areas. Your team can do this, too.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Submit your schedules and budgets by Thursday Tax Oct. 30, 2019 The Tax final submission deadline for FlexForecast budgets for work occurring between January and May for resource deployment purposes is October 31. FlexForecast budgets should be “Sent to Deployment” for all engagements you are 80% sure will be starting in the coming months and where the total contract will exceed 200 hours. The budget should cover the total expected duration of the engagement. Not sure yet what your final scope and fees will be? That’s OK! Only a Draft budget with resource names or “TBDs” and weekly hours is required at this point for purposes of deployment planning, and you’ll be able to update and finalize the budget later. Note that this deadline should not override any market specific deadlines set by your deployment consultant. Here are some tips to make the process efficient: You can copy from prior year budget or actuals. You can download/upload hours changes from Excel directly into FlexForecast budgets. Once you have added all team members to the online budget, the “custom spread” allows you to allocate the timing of hours across the weeks of the project. See these FAQs for more! FlexForecast saves you time and reduces duplication of work because the Draft budget you create now should be the same one your team updates later with your fees, expenses, and resource hours to review the expected economics of your engagement. Please continue to engage your Deployment Consultant, PM Driver, or Tax Finance team with questions or concerns specific to your market and engagement.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Tax AC Phoenix reservations for 2020 due Nov. 22 Tax Oct. 23, 2019 We are continuing our journey to deliver greater quality to our clients at a lower cost, while managing our profitability. To do so, it is critical that we work with our AC teams on a more consistent basis, engage and team more effectively with our AC teams, and plan/coordinate in advance. Help the ACs help you: get your Tax AC Phoenix Reservations for all of calendar year 2020 submitted by November 22, so we can ensure we have the right resources to support you. You do not need to have new WBS codes or current engagement letters in place to set up your reservations. As part of a more simplified approach to putting in reservations we have added a Roll Forward functionality. If you are already using an AC, Engagement Teams will now have the opportunity to utilize their current year Engagement as a template for next year’s reservation. This will save time and reduce the amount of inputs to create a new Engagement as the dates, services and hours by week will all be pre-populated based on last year! Please see the updated QRC for Creating Engagements, Forecasting and completing an Engagement Roll Forward for Engagement Teams located on the Phoenix Spark page. In addition we have a short video demonstrating the Roll Forward process! Reminders: To utilize the Roll Forward feature, your current year Engagement must be ACTIVE. Do not close your current Engagement until you have allowed for Auto Roll Forward or have Manually Rolled Forward, as you will lose the opportunity to use this feature. You need to create/roll forward new Engagement profiles for each Tax year. The engagement name should begin with the Tax year, e.g. 2019 Federal Compliance. Separate Engagements are needed for each Engagement Partner within a client. If you do not have a new WBS code when creating your Engagement, please check “No Charge Code” during your Engagement creation. If you utilize Tax Engagement Center for your engagement, you will be able to take advantage of the Phoenix integration and submit your reservation through EC by rolling forward your engagement within Tax Engagement Center. These features will be available within Tax Engagement Center beginning October 31. Make sure to complete or update the Forecast Details with your best estimate of the weekly hours when you’ll need AC resources. As the details regarding the work request, (e.g. timing or WBS code) change throughout the engagement, update Phoenix accordingly and notify your delivery team via email. Visit the Tax Acceleration Center Tax Source site for information on AC Activities, FAQs, key contacts and more.

After renewing or obtaining your PTIN, report your PTIN through the PTIN Confirmation on your My Compliance Dashboard by the due date. The PTIN requirement is a two-step process: Register/Renew your PTIN at www.irs.gov/ptin Report your PTIN (or request an exemption) through the PTIN Confirmation on your My Compliance Dashboard The PTIN requirement is a Tax LOS Core Compliance Requirement. The Core Compliance Requirements are subject to specific sanction protocols if not completed on time. As such, failure to complete the requirement by the due date subjects you to specific sanctions for late completion, including consequences up to suspension for staff and fines for partners. New for 2020 renewal season: A data security responsibilities statement and confirmation checkbox has been added to the PTIN renewal application. The statement is an acknowledgment that the PTIN applicant is “aware that paid tax return preparers must have a data security plan in place to provide data and system security protection for all taxpayer information.” To maintain the appropriate degree of confidentiality, privacy and security of taxpayer information, firm personnel must follow the requirements of the Information Protection Principles (the “Principles”). Each individual obtaining or renewing a PTIN should review the Principles for information regarding the firm’s processes for safeguarding taxpayer information and their roles and responsibilities with respect to such processes. Note: If you were required to obtain a 2019 PTIN and have not yet done so, you must obtain a valid 2019 PTIN before you can renew for 2020. Obtaining a PTIN valid for the 2020 calendar year does not satisfy the requirement to obtain a PTIN valid for the 2019 calendar year. The firm requires all Tax personnel below manager (including interns) to obtain a PTIN regardless of job role or designated business unit, and requires all managers and above to obtain a PTIN unless they (1) do not anticipate preparing, or assisting in the preparation of, all or substantially all of a federal tax return or claim for refund, and (2) work in one of the narrowly excluded business units (link). Additionally, all tax professionals, including those qualifying for an exemption, must obtain and report an approved exemption. For additional information regarding your PTIN responsibilities, including responses to FAQs regarding the application and renewal process, click on the PTIN Toolkit. NOTE: If you received an exemption in the prior year, and your role has not changed, you are not required to obtain additional approval from OFRO Tax or update your exemption. However, should your circumstances change such that you no longer qualify for an exemption (e.g., change groups, preparation of returns, etc.), you may need to obtain a PTIN and update Ethics &amp; Compliance by sending an email to Ethics &amp; Compliance. If you have any further questions, please contact Jim Emilian at (202) 251-4459 or Emily Burgardt at (408) 613-5973.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Infinite Learning activated: Respected time &amp; Tax Development Paths Tax Nov. 3, 2019 At PwC, learning is something that happens every day all around us, with limitless possibilities. We want you to be an Infinite Learner — to learn and grow, so you can do your job more effectively and be ready for new opportunities. That’s why our investment in our people includes investing in your Learning &amp; Development. It’s a core piece of our Your Tomorrow strategy and one way we deliver the skills and knowledge we all need to be future-ready. Here are two ways we’re doing more to support L&amp;D in FY20: Infinite Learning Days to respect your time We’ve heard from you that it can be difficult to find time for learning. As a start, we’ve designated three Infinite Learning Days (24 hours total) in FY20 to advance your learning objectives — whether it’s for Tax Foundation Milestones, Digital Upskilling, engagement-based study teams, catching up on CPE or whatever else will contribute to your L&amp;D experience. Our three designated Tax Infinite Learning Days are: November 18 (add to calendar) — suggested area: Tax Technical January 10 (add to calendar) — suggested area: Industry/Specialty Tax training June 5 (add to calendar) — suggested area: Digital upskilling/Tax technology tools We will block these days in TalentLink for all Tax staff. Please note though that due to busy periods or other commitments, some BUs/teams may schedule their Infinite Learning Day on different dates around these same times — known alternate dates are: FM on December 13 (add to calendar); NYM BCMI, ITP on January 6 (add to calendar); MLP on April 17 (add to calendar). Tax Development Paths to guide your way Would you like guidance as to what L&amp;D courses you should be taking and when? How about an L&amp;D experience that matches the relevant skills for your role with the ability to set a pace that’s right for you? We’ve addressed that and more in our new Tax Development Paths, which capture learning by staff level and business unit, show what content is required and recommended, and what’s ahead as you progress in your career. Here’s how to make Infinite Learning meaningful Learners Work with your RL to plan ahead for Infinite Learning Days and familiarize yourself with your Development Path With your RL, identify courses that support your career goals and development priorities Plan for the day and communicate accordingly with your engagement teams (if you can’t participate on the designated day, work with your leader to choose an alternative date) Stay connected with your RL on how to meet your L&amp;D goals Relationship Leaders Review the appropriate Development Path with each of your assignees and advise them on specific courses, keeping in mind Foundational Milestones and courses needed for promotion Prepare staff for Infinite Learning Days and review L&amp;D commitments (as referenced in One Firm and Tax FY20 Expectations) Reinforce importance of prioritizing learning, whether that be protecting time to attend conferences or to meet other L&amp;D requirements (e.g., encouraging discussion with their engagement team, working with managers/directors to plan, etc.) Additional details for RLs to follow separately Tax Team leaders/Engagement team leaders Drive awareness of development paths and infinite learning days and encourage staff to begin planning with their RLs Respect learners’ protected time — and where required, help identify an alternate date Reinforce importance of prioritizing learning, whether that be protecting time to attend conferences or to meet other L&amp;D requirements Contact: Tax Development Path L&amp;D team Quick read We want you to be an Infinite Learner — to learn and grow, so you can do your job more effectively and be ready for new opportunities.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Self-nominate for Talent Movement -- here's why Last year, Boston Senior Associate Frank Cicchetti felt like he might enjoy project-based work — a change from his Financial Services role. “I wanted to try something new. I liked my current role, but Talent Movement was an opportunity to see what else is out there in Tax.” Frank self-nominated and was placed with the Specialized Tax Services (STS) group. “As a senior associate, I was worried about my subject matter expertise — I hadn’t done this type of work before. But there was a lot of carry-over from Financial Services, and the general tax knowledge I had was a great foundation. I also participated in training before and throughout my transition to STS.” “I’ve already learned so much being with a different team. I’ve diversified my experience, I’m meeting new clients, making new connections and growing my skills.” And what advice does Frank have for those considering Talent Movement this year? “Go for it! If you have the initiative to try something new, Tax makes this an easy process. Lean into your new group you so get the most out of the experience.” For a limited time — now through October 11 — Tax staff can submit a self-nomination to participate in a tour in one of our Tax BUs.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Smart Factory Integrated Solution accelerates Stanley Black &amp; Decker’s leadership in Industry 4.0 Advisory Aug. 29, 2019 What challenge was Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SBD) looking to solve? As part of its scale-up phase, SBD’s Industry 4.0 Center of Excellence looked for a partner to: Demonstrate the value of smart factory solutions in a high performing, capacity-constrained operating environment Help them reinvent how factory and operations personnel interact with and leverage technology - using digital solutions as part of their standard work for driving improved factory performance. How did we leverage the Integrated Solution in our pitch to SBD? Smart Factory Integrated Solution, aligned to our Fit for Growth platform, offers manufacturers a comprehensive, accelerated path to building a smart factory that will help them: maximize operational performance, and effectively support the business strategy with new operational capabilities in the age of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The Smart Factory Integrated Solution assets enabled us to create a compelling proposal within a short timeframe as all materials were already collected and client-ready, built on a differentiated BXT philosophy. Having a proven approach for value creation and digital operations innovation gave us a strong foundation to build out our tailored approach for SBD. We utilized the Smart Factory Integrated Solution in the following ways: Selling playbook, including the impact stories and showcased our Factory Intelligence solutions. Leveraged our repository of sample proposals, case study library, SoW templates, and approach / pricing guideline for the proposal phase. In the delivery phase, we leveraged the Integrated Solution delivery approach and use case library to identify and detail high-value use cases together with the client team. We followed the agile delivery method to build the customized use cases for the client based on our pre-existing accelerator, the PwC-developed Factory Intelligence solutions. The client valued our interdisciplinary team composed of experts in manufacturing operations, Industry 4.0 analytics, and user experience. What results will SBD see using our solution? Up to 15% Operating Equipment Efficiency improvement when the solution is fully rolled out and incorporated in the daily life of the plant team. Improvement opportunities that are anticipated to create &gt;$2M of traceable cost savings, per plant, plus an ability to create capacity to enable growth without additional capital or labor investments. How is this win significant for us and what results will we see? This win has a high strategic importance for PwC. SBD is one of the priority accounts for Industrial Products and Services (IPS) and the win allowed us to strengthen our brand with SBD’s Industry 4.0 team, operations teams, business unit leaders, and executive suite. Our collaborative delivery approach resonated well and we’ve received multiple additional RFPs and a sole-source opportunity to expand our work across multiple business units. SBD is a leading player in Industry 4.0 in the US and advertises frequently as such. Being a trusted advisor for them will help us gain credibility, work on cutting-edge implementations, and open the doors at other industrial clients. Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Google data retention policy: What it means for Advisory Advisory Sept. 13, 2019 Did you know that starting Nov. 1, emails older than 18 months (both Gmail and Lotus Notes) and My Drive files which have a “last modified” date older than 36 months will be automatically deleted?* Read this PwC Inside article announcing the change and familiarize yourself with our Records &amp; Data Management policy. What does this mean for me, in Advisory? In Advisory, we create a variety of materials that are critical to client engagements and firm operations. We must think critically about what’s important to keep, and what’s not, making educated decisions to ensure that what should be kept is managed appropriately. The new data retention policy will be put in place to automate the process for releasing the data we don’t need and was established in line with industry standards for data retention. What to do prior to the deadline? Start a conversation with your team on how to manage data moving forward. PwC is moving away from a “keep everything forever” mindset, and we each have a responsibility to prepare and adapt to our new ways of working. Guidelines for data retention in Advisory: Consider allowing automated deletion of files (that live in your My Drive) that haven’t been modified in 36 months. It is very unlikely that this data falls into the category of “must keep” — and therefore you should consider deleting. Follow established protocols for maintaining and retaining engagement documentation. Refer to Consulting RM policy 39. Use the current Advisory record system, MAP to store required engagement documentation. Business critical materials should not be housed in your My Drive or email. You should leverage other firm systems (Salesforce, Google Shared Drives**, etc.) to store other business critical documents. If it’s not business critical, it should be deleted in the timeframes outlined in the Google data retention policy. If you or your team needs help please reach out to the Chief Data Office and request a briefing and consultation. Who is responsible? We are all responsible for managing the data lifecycle. That means getting comfortable with and thinking critically about what’s important for us to keep and what’s not — and ensuring we have the right processes in place to support those decisions. * Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold or part of an exception group. ** Google Shared Drives (formerly known as Team Drives) are not subject to the Google data retention policies at this time.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Mohamed Kande: Advisory Q1 Update Advisory Oct. 18, 2019 Team, FY20 is all about accelerating our One Firm and Advisory 2.0 strategy -- and we are off to a strong start. As we move into Q2, let’s stay focused on our digital upskilling journey by being active in Digital Labs, incorporating BXT into our delivery, driving our Integrated Solutions, generating demand through market campaigns, and pricing for the value we deliver. Together, we are changing the game. As we continue to execute on our strategy in Q2, keep this in mind: Our FY20 Performance bonus plan -- Here’s what you should know about how we share the firm’s success and reward your personal impact with the FY20 Performance bonus plan: Funding of the FY20 bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Paying at, above, or below the target bonus ranges will be determined by whether we meet, exceed or fall short of our goals. Click here or launch the Me@PwC app (for US staff) to learn more about your earnings potential and how your impact influences your pay. Remain focused on achieving your goals and identifying ways to expand your knowledge and skills as outlined in the FY20 One Firm &amp; Advisory Expectations. Impact described in your Snapshots (including flexing your digital fitness and contributions to tech-enabling PwC) along with your performance metrics compared to your peers, will continue to be the key inputs during Career Roundtable. Thank you for all of your hard work. I look forward to connecting soon. Delivering as One Firm: Driving Demand: Proactive demand generation was a top focus in Q1 -- using our Platforms, Integrated Solutions and Products to identify and address client problems. Vertical-specific campaigns began to move the needle, accelerating our shift to more high margin, transformational work. xLOS teaming with colleagues from Assurance and Tax is allowing us to deliver as One Firm and provide the highest value to our clients. Hear from teams who are successfully leveraging our Platforms here. (~10-15 min podcasts). Pricing for the value we deliver. One Firm Smart Pricing is increasingly allowing us to price based on the full value we deliver -- better representing the automations, digitally-enabled integrated solutions and BXT approaches that wouldn’t have been captured in previous pricing models. All managers and above should be using the Smart Pricing Microsite as part of all pricing processes. Missed the trainings? View the replays: Advisory Smart Pricing 101 / Advisory Smart Pricing 201 Supporting our practice: As we work to execute on our One Firm and Advisory 2.0 strategies, we’ve made updates to our Advisory teams. Q1 Results: The FY20 Q1 FYTD results included revenue of $1.48B (2.7% favorable to budget), engagement margin of 28.8% (0.9 points above budget), and client utilization exceeded budget by 1.3 points at 67.3%. This success is largely due to investments we are making in our business and our firm. Investing in our business: Integrated Solutions continue to drive significant impact as our Advisory engagement teams bring our strategic playbooks to life. To date, we have $919M in wins and $4.0B in our Integrated Solutions pipeline. Case in point: we beat out key competitors to win a 6-month, $18M engagement with Kimberly-Clarke -- congratulations to the team! The secret? Using the Fit-for-Growth Platform; the Trade for Promotion Management Integrated Solution; a BXT approach to proposal materials; the Performance Analyzer product and a smart pricing structure (fees at risk). Investing in you: A large part of our One Firm strategy continues to be investing in our people BXT for the win: Our BXT site is live and teams are applying learnings from our BXT Incubators to deliver greater value to their clients (hear one team’s story here).

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Front Office Transformation Integrated Solution for the win at Xilinx Advisory Sept. 10, 2019 What challenge was Xilinx trying to solve? Xilinx is on a mission to build an adaptable, intelligent world. As one of the leaders in the semiconductor and programmable device world, they were at a crossroads - it was essential for them to modernize their sales function and increase user adoption of their Siebel Customer Relationship Management (CRM) implementation. If they do not transform, the sales function would be unable to support effective account discussions with existing customers, prospects, and partners thus compromising their market position and eventually their future. How did we propose solving their challenge using an Integrated Solution? The Front Office Transformation (FOT) Integrated Solution, specifically the Sales &amp; Marketing Excellence accelerator toolkit, was at the center of our value proposition for Xilinx. Front Office Transformation (FOT) Integrated Solution supports our Fit for Growth platform, helping create an environment for change to happen and culture to evolve by standardizing business processes, and improving collaboration around customer needs. Our multi-competency delivery approach of this solution, with a pre-configured model system, set us apart from the competition. We challenged Xilinx on its status quo and used our deep industry expertise to help the business rethink its CRM strategy and business processes. Throughout the proposal journey, the team stayed true to the core aspects of the FOT Integrated Solution, leveraging the playbook, sales toolkit, standard proposals and preconfigured model systems. Our demonstrated ability and proposal to help Xilinx in their transformation journey impressed Salesforce and made them an advocate for PwC in the front office. How did the integrated solution change what we sold, compared to a past selling experience? This is our first transformational win at Xilinx and it’s clear that the Integrated Solution was key to that win. The Integrated Solution gave us a baseline and the focus to challenge Xilinx to stay within the capabilities of CRM + PRM (partner relationship management). Xilinx appreciated the time-to-value benefits of our approach and our industry expertise. What results will Xilinx see using our solution? Consolidating approximately 20 legacy systems (including Siebel) with Salesforce as the primary engagement platform for sales and leadership teams, which will lead to cost and time savings. Retiring inefficient practices of legacy spreadsheets, which led to inaccurate visibility of pipeline and opportunities. Helping begin the journey onto Salesforce, which will give Xilinx a more integrated, higher productive sales management tool across business units (both traditional &amp; new) while thinking more broadly about how to maximize the Xilinx investment in Salesforce. How is this win significant for us and what results will we see? Continued strengthening of our Salesforce Alliance relationship, as the opportunity came through the partnership. Showcases global partnership, with the PwC India Salesforce Practice co-delivering the engagement. Highlights cross-engagement teaming - bringing in the People &amp; Organization team leading a change management engagement also at Xilinx Supports Advisory 2.0 priorities with an Integrated Solution at the forefront, delivery through a BXT approach, and cross-teaming through GTMs. Generates opportunities for future phases of work with Xilinx (e.g. CPQ, Customer Communities, Service Transformation) and potential for xLoS team involvement. Meet the Team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Anti-Bribery Anti-Corruption Integrated Solution for the win at Bunge Limited Advisory June 18, 2019 What was the challenge Bunge asked us to solve? Bunge Limited was looking to assess and enhance their global compliance program, with a focus on bribery and corruption risks specific to third-party management and monitoring of higher risk activities. While going through this process, they wanted to preserve the brand trust established during their 200 operational years and equip the company to better face anti-bribery and anti-corruption (ABAC) compliance challenges of today, tomorrow and into the future. What was our solution for Bunge? We held a brainstorming workshop with Bunge’s compliance team and shared real-time ideas with them to drive enhancements on the design and execution of their ABAC Compliance Program, particularly related to third-party risk management and monitoring activities. The team leveraged the framework of our ABAC Integrated Solution, including our methodology to help clients prepare for, respond to and emerge stronger from compliance challenges, and demos of certain proprietary digital assets. Our broad and cross-functional approach was driven by a team with diverse functional and sector experience and was enabled through the demonstration of digital assets, for example compliance tracker, offering the ability to provide clarity around key risks and visibility into the unknown. Delivering the solution with a BXT approach, from a consumer perspective, wowed the Bunge leadership team who said, "there was a consensus at Bunge about the quality of your work and the presentation." What results will Bunge see using our solution? The use of a technology enabled solution should help Bunge to increase efficiencies in monitoring execution which will deliver increased value to the organization, through the following: -Centralized web-based platform (Compliance Tracker) to manage the monitoring analytics, execution and reporting -Case management to track potential compliance matters from identification through remediation, with customizable workflow and audit trail -Tailored monitoring summary dashboards to simplify and visualize results for management and executives. -Automation of data processing, analytics, and on-demand reporting. More visibility and clarity into risks and the unknown, allowing Bunge to make better strategic and tactical decisions in managing its business in various complex locations on a global basis. More consistent view of key areas of risk and higher risk third parties on a go forward basis. Lessons learned from certain locations that can be applied to the business in a broader manner. How is this win significant and what results will we see? A substantial margin delivered for the firm at ~34%. A showcase in Advisory 2.0 strategic agenda with the use of an Integrated Solution, a BXT approach and Your Tomorrow digital usage focus. A streamlined, digital approach that can be consistently applied across xLoS PwC engagements by leveraging the Digital Compliance &amp; Fraud Office (DCFO) technology tool, Compliance Tracker. Enhanced relationships across functional areas at the company and a strong showing of our Risk and Regulatory platform messaging- focusing the complexity of risk into a powerful business strategy by helping clients proactively understand and evolve with the changing global regulatory landscape. Ability to identify other areas where we may be able to add value for the client and introduce others to bring new ideas. New insights to showcase on our recently launched Anti-bribery Anti-corruption external webpage! Meet the team! This was truly a team effort and we had close interactions and support from the account team, from the GEP (Peter Frank) to the client driver (Donna Panettiere). We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname From burritos to guac, we helped Chipotle reimagine loyalty through BXT Advisory Oct. 1, 2019 Chipotle wanted a way to identify and communicate with individual customers to accomplish several crucial business objectives. Understand customers better through data Build loyalty Generate increased demand Help staff become front-line ambassadors for the chain The PwC difference: Our strengths shine through in our work with Chipotle “One of the smoothest launches in company history.” Chief Restaurant Officer Chipotle We brought everyone together to tackle the issue and solve the problem That meant building a team inclusive of competitors, vendors, executives, and front-line workers. And it meant developing a command center approach for launches--aka mission control. The command center included everyone with a stake in the design, tech and customer experience. It’s something Chipotle said they’d never done before. We led the project with our professional conscience, our way of working: BXT PwC helped Chipotle strategize, design, test and launch a loyalty platform across 2,500 stores by remaining focused on experience for customers and employees. We did it by working differently. By living BXT. That meant titles down, creative minds in, and all ideas on the table. We brought curiosity, bold ideas and a focus on experience, going beyond a deliverables mindset to ignite the experience and keep the momentum going--even through a headquarters move and executive change. To do it, we had to not just embrace, but quarterback the vision. It’s an approach that’s proven. And it delivered results--big time--for Chipotle. During an 18-month, BXT-fueled project that involved more than 75 players and multiple teams, we turned loyalty on its head--in a good way. PwC defined and influenced tech requirements, integrating the needs of multiple players around the world. To make it successful, we also built a customized change management program, engaging staff at all levels with training that mattered, when and where they needed it. Yes, we even helped make every employee a change agent. And it worked--Chipotle saw a: 99% increase in digital sales (Q2 2019 YOY); 1M enrollments in Chipotle Rewards within the first week; 6 million within six months and $1.4B in revenue, an increase of 13.2% (Q2 2019 YOY). With deeper connections to its customers and PwC as its partner, Chipotle didn’t just get its groove back, but reimagined the very idea of loyalty.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Inclusivity shines at Advisory Start Foundations Advisory Sept. 17, 2019 This past August we welcomed 318 new joiners to our Advisory practice through a newly re-designed Advisory Start Foundations program in Orlando. Throughout the program 39 facilitators led our new joiners through an action-packed week of learning our firm’s Your Tomorrow vision, our Advisory 2.0 strategy, and our PwC culture. Thank you to the facilitators and the L&amp;D team that helped put this innovative program together! Marcos Goldstein, one of the facilitators, led an unexpected organic discussion about inclusivity, authenticity and intersectionality, some of the underlying themes of the program redesign. As Marcos was introducing himself to the group, he included his pronouns, mentioning that his advice to new joiners would be to bring themselves to work starting from day one. After ten minutes, the plenary facilitator questioned the general audience: “Can you describe situations in your life where you felt like an outsider but became an insider?” One man in the crowd of 350 stood up and shared: “I was feeling like an outsider until Marcos spoke and talked about his pronouns. That allowed for a conversation to take place for me as a queer man.” Marcos shared his perspective on this in a LinkedIn article: "Bring your Whole Self to work." We called him to bring you more of the story straight from the source! Refer to https://pwc.diverst.com/groups for more information about our Inclusion Networks. Special thanks to the combined Advisory Human Capital and L&amp;D teams for making this event come to life!

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Who won with Workspace ONE? PwC Technology Jan. 7, 2020 More than 21,000 PwCers are using Workspace ONE, the new way to connect mobile devices to PwC. It replaces MobileIron as the platform to access email, calendar, contacts, PwC apps and office wifi. And drumroll please … Congrats to Katrin Gubin, who was selected at random from all eligible US staff who have moved to Workspace ONE. This lucky winner will be starting off 2020 with a brand-new pair of AirPods Pro! Could you be next? An early migration means you’ll be entered into more of our monthly drawings — so migrate now to maximize your chances of winning (see official rules for details). Our Workspace ONE migration assistant will walk you through a one-time setup. Here’s how to get started with Workspace ONE. 5 tips for a smooth Workspace ONE transition While the process is designed to be simple, there are a number of steps to follow. Some tips: You’ll need your PwC PC and mobile device. It should take about 15 minutes per device (longer if you update the OS, back up the device or have a lot of apps). The process removes MobileIron and all PwC apps, wifi connectivity, etc. If you’re in a PwC office, you’ll lose your wifi connection and your device will automatically switch to the cell carrier’s data. If you have more than one device, migrate one at a time, but in quick succession. Most apps automatically reinstall, but some require special backup and installation (details here). Don’t skip the step where you log in to GlobalProtect and SecureSSO. Want more details about making the switch? Get the highlights in under 10 minutes with this Connect &amp; Learn demo! Need a hand? Reserve with IT If you don’t feel up to the task, the PwC Help Desk is here to help. Schedule time for one-on-one assistance through Reserve with IT. Get the latest premium apps on Workspace ONE As a bonus, when you switch to Workspace ONE you’ll get exclusive access to apps you can’t get otherwise. You’ll find premium apps — paid for by the firm — like Carrot Weather, AutoSleep Tracker for Watch and more. But you can only access them when you switch to Workspace ONE.

Crisis support Each September, many mental health organizations and individuals across the US and around the world raise awareness of suicide prevention during National Suicide Prevention Month. Learn the warning signs, how to talk with someone who may be at risk, where to get help and how to cope if you’re a suicide survivor. The following tips from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can help you help someone else who might be talking about suicide. Be direct. Talk openly and matter-of-factly about suicide. Be willing to listen. Allow expressions of feelings. Accept the feelings. Be non-judgmental. Don't debate whether suicide is right or wrong, or whether feelings are good or bad. Don't lecture on the value of life. Get involved. Become available. Show interest and support. Don't act shocked. This will put distance between you. Don't be sworn to secrecy. Seek support. Offer hope that alternatives are available but do not offer glib reassurance. Get help from persons or agencies specializing in crisis intervention and suicide prevention.

On the myLiveandworkwell app, click Connect, Search Live and Work Well, and then from the menu, click Suicide Prevention from the Crisis Support drop down menu.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Bonus time means it’s time to think about your 401(k) contributions National Benefits Sept. 5, 2019 With FY19 bonuses to be paid on Sept. 30, those eligible1 for bonus payments may want to consider how their 401(k) contribution rate will affect their payment. If you currently make contributions to PwC's 401(k) Savings Plan — more than 90% of staff participate — whatever percentage you've elected to contribute to your account will apply to your semi-monthly pay and your bonus payment. It will be deposited into your 401(k) Savings Plan account on Sept. 30. If you're eligible for a bonus, note the following: - If you want to change your contribution rate in the 401(k) Savings Plan, you must make a contribution rate change at Benefits Express Online prior to 4 p.m. ET on Sept. 15 (or 4 p.m. ET on Sept. 13 if the change is made by phone). Any changes made by Sept. 15 at 4 p.m. ET will affect your Sept. 30 payroll deduction (which includes your bonus payment). - If you make a change in light of the bonus payment but want to resume your original contribution rate for your Oct. 15 pay, you must make another contribution rate change at Benefits Express between Sept. 16-30 at 4 p.m. ET. Remember: If you don’t make a change by Sept. 15 at 4 p.m. ET, your current contribution election will apply to any September bonus payment as well as all semi-monthly paychecks until you change your election in the future. 401(k) Savings Plan contribution limits The IRS limits 401(k) plan pre-tax contributions to $19,000 in 2019 ($25,000 if you will be age 50 by Dec. 31). Depending on your earnings, contribution rate and the amount of your bonus, the September bonus may result in you maxing out your pre-tax contribution early, thereby resulting in a loss of firm matching contributions for the remainder of the year unless you elect to contribute on a post-tax basis once you meet the pre-tax limit. You can view your year-to-date 401(k) Savings Plan contributions, as well as update your contribution election, via Me@PwC on HQ or on the Me@PwC App. Note: The Me@PwC app is for US staff only and is available for the iPhone, Android and iPad. This app is not available to partners, interns, contractors or US staff on international assignment. Quick read Your 401(k) Savings Plan contribution election will apply to your Sept. 30 bonus payment. If you don’t want this to happen, make a new election by Sept. 15 at 4 p.m. ET.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Take your contributions to the max with increased limits for 2020 National Benefits Dec. 10, 2019 The IRS announced new 401(k), Health Savings Account, and commuter plan contribution limits effective Jan. 1, 2020. Take advantage of these opportunities to save more while cutting your tax bill in the process. Check out this podcast to learn more about the benefits of pre-tax savings. And, if you haven’t already done so, subscribe to our podcast channel, 4 My Benefit. Maximize your 401(k) savings For 2020, you can stash up to $19,500 pre-tax in your 401(k) Savings Plan (up from $19,000 in 2019). If you’re 50 or older, you can save an additional $6,500. The pre-tax dollars you contribute do not count toward your gross income for the year, which lowers your taxable income — and your taxes. Plus, you can also contribute after-tax money. When you contribute either pre-tax or after-tax money, the firm matches 25% of the first 6% of your eligible compensation. Your aggregate pre- and after-tax contributions (including the firm match and what PwC puts in your Wealth Builder account) cannot exceed $57,000 in 2020 ($63,500 if you’re over 50). Staff can increase, decrease or stop 401(k) contribution amounts at any time throughout the year via Benefits Express Online. Partners can find the updated 2020 retirement plan contribution summary page in the 401(k) row on the Balance Sheet in the Partner Portal. Add more to your HSA You have an opportunity to save from $50 - $100 more in your HSA during 2020 than in 2019. If you have individual coverage in the UnitedHealthcare (UHC) Medical Plan, you can contribute up to $3,550 to your HSA; PwCers with other coverage levels can contribute up to $7,100 (including the firm’s contribution for staff enrolled in the High and Middle Deductible Plan). Your HSA contributions are tax-deductible, and withdrawals are tax-free, too, as long as you use them for qualified medical expenses. Remember, your HSA balance is yours to carry over from year to year if you don’t need it for medical expenses today, and you can invest any balance over $1,000. Increase, decrease or stop your HSA contributions at any time throughout the year via Benefits Express Online. Learn more about HSAs via this video, an online course and the HealthEquity HSA learning site. Note: if you received an email on Dec. 6 from Benefits Express advising you that your HSA would automatically increase to the new 2020 limit, you do not have to act. Your HSA contribution increase will happen automatically, effective Jan. 1. Save on your commute If you take public transportation to work or pay for parking — even just a couple days a week — you can reduce your commuting costs on average by 30% when you participate in the Commuter Benefits Program. That’s because you can set aside up to $270 per month for transit expenses and $270 per month for parking expenses (up from $265 in 2019) before taxes are taken, translating to more money in your pocket each month. For more information about enrollment and eligible expenses, or to elect or change a contribution amount, visit wageworks.com. The Commuter Benefits Program is available to active US staff receiving US pay only. Interns and temporary employees, partners and principals, and staff of the Puerto Rico and Mexico offices are not eligible.

        <pwc_body>Alexa, refill my Express Scripts prescription Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Alexa, refill my Express Scripts prescription National Benefits Oct. 22, 2019 We all work hard and we need to take care of ourselves, crucial to Be well, work well. Express Scripts' new Amazon Alexa-enabled mail order prescription management feature is a new digital resource to help empower us to play an active role in our personal well-being. Who can use Alexa for prescription drugs? Alexa-enabled prescription drug management is available through Express Scripts to PwC UnitedHealthcare (UHC) High, Middle or Low Deductible Plan participants who take maintenance medication(s) — which means you’re taking medicine on a regular, recurring basis over an extended period of time, such as birth control or treatment for an ongoing condition like asthma, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis, etc. Alexa cannot be used if you are taking Specialty medications filled by Accredo, Express Scripts’ Specialty pharmacy. How do I start using Alexa for Express Scripts? Managing prescription drug home delivery is even more convenient than before through Express Scripts’ partnership with Amazon. If you use an Alexa-enabled device, and you have a current prescription with the Express Scripts home delivery pharmacy, you can start using this feature right away. You’ll need to enable the Express Scripts skill on Alexa. Enabling a skill is like enabling an app on a smartphone; you can find instructions on Amazon. Once the Alexa skill is enabled, simply say “Alexa, open Express Scripts” to place your order or ask your question. Then, use your 12-digit home delivery prescription number (included on a current prescription with Express Scripts or on the Express Scripts website) to ask Alexa for your order status. Alexa can respond with any one of the following statuses: order received, processing, shipped, or cancelled. Alexa can also proactively provide you with order notifications when the status changes, alerting you with the Alexa-enabled device’s green light indicator. When the indicator is lit, and you ask for an update by saying "Alexa, read my notifications," Alexa will respond with the update. Savvy healthcare consumers use Express Scripts Pharmacy home delivery service and generics Using Express Scripts home delivery pharmacy for regular, recurring long-term medications can reduce your current personal expenses and even help minimize future health plan cost increases. With home delivery, you can get a larger supplies (up to 90 days) of medication at a lower cost than when purchased at a retail pharmacy (up to a 30-day supply) and auto-refill features help ensure you don’t run out of your medication. Home delivery service typically features better negotiated prices than are available at a retail pharmacy. Prescriptions are delivered directly to your door with no standard shipping charges and you have 24/7 access to Express Scripts pharmacists from the privacy of your own home. Another way to save money either via home delivery or at the retail pharmacy is to consider generic and preferred brand medications. Generic drugs typically cost less and can be equally effective as brand name medications for most people, so talk to your doctor when you get a prescription. And, consider the ‘preferred brands’ available at a lower cost under the plan if a generic is not available. Go to Express Scripts for more information. Privacy is important Express Scripts does not share your personal health information with Amazon Alexa. Content provided by this skill may be available to anyone using your Alexa devices. But, to protect your interactions with Express Scripts, your Alexa interaction history and activity cards associated with this skill will not be viewable in the Alexa App or via https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy. Questions If you have any questions about this new service, please contact Express Scripts at (800) PwC-9501 (792-9501). You can also find more information, including possible commands, by visiting the Express Scripts skill on Amazon’s Alexa companion app (iOS/Android).

Hinge Health now offers a hip pain program, along with the back and knee pain programs that were introduced in the spring. Hinge Health provides personalized, digital, remotely-guided care for hip, back or knee pain with a tablet and wearable sensors that provide real-time feedback.

Hinge Health has already helped more than 2,500 PwCers complete knee and back programs, reducing their average pain level by over 55% in just 12 weeks.

        <pwc_body>Update on FY21 healthcare premiums Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Update on FY21 healthcare premiums National Benefits Dec. 13, 2019 The following information does not apply to partners, residents of Puerto Rico, Mexico region staff, or staff deployed on outbound global mobility assignment. We all work hard, so it’s important that we take care of ourselves. We have many programs and resources that empower us to make healthy choices and protect our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being including innovative options like Well-Being Rewards, Be well, work well, the Calm and Ginger Emotional Support apps, Gympass, Hinge Health digital physical therapy and more. PwC’s medical plans (including prescription drug coverage) continue to be an essential component of our benefits, providing a foundation for each of us and our families to protect our physical and mental health. FY21 PwC medical plan cost preview for US staff Now that half of the fiscal year is almost complete, planning for our annual benefits enrollment period in May 2020 is underway. You’ve told us you want advance notice regarding changes that affect you personally. To help you plan and budget, we’re sharing our anticipated healthcare approach and premium increases effective July 1, 2020 now rather than waiting until the spring as we typically do. We will share more detailed information about the benefit plans and final premium cost changes in mid-April. Here’s what you can expect. PwC will continue to subsidize the majority of the cost of healthcare coverage for staff as we have in the past. Our policy is to pay approximately 70% of the overall cost of healthcare premiums. You’ll continue to have the choice to select coverage in any one of the three current medical plans offered through UnitedHealthcare (including prescription drug coverage through Express Scripts) — High, Middle or Low Deductible Plan. PwC will continue to deposit the current amounts each pay period to High and Middle Deductible Plan participants’ Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) (for staff: $300 individual/$600 family annually in the Middle Deductible Plan and $700 individual/$1,400 family annually in the High Deductible Plan). PwC medical plan premium increases have been well below the national average medical inflation cost trend of 5.7% for the past two years1. In FY21, we expect premium increases for staff to be close to the national average, with anticipated increases between 5% and 7%. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE If PwC premiums increase by 6% in FY21, the amount you pay each semi-monthly pay period would increase by the following on July 1, 2020 (final cost changes will be available in April 2020) Coverage level* High Deductible Plan Middle Deductible Plan Low Deductible Plan Staff only coverage illustrative premium increase $2.00 $4.00 $5.50 Family coverage illustrative premium increase $8.50 $15.50 $20.50 * Premium increases for other coverage levels would fall between the staff only increase and family increase. Check out the savvy healthcare consumer round-up of resources, tools and tips to help you as you think about budgeting for next year. Healthcare trends and costs Like many large employers, PwC’s healthcare plans are self-insured, which means they are designed and priced to reflect the actual claims and usage of our people. Empowering everyone in the firm to make healthy choices by taking advantage of our well-being and benefits programs helps all of us as individuals and as a firm. While not all healthcare costs are tied to lifestyle factors, taking an active role in our personal well-being can help us stay healthier, reduce our personal spending on healthcare and improve our financial well-being over the long term. And when we collectively manage our healthcare spending, we also help to manage potential increases in the cost of our healthcare premiums. Medical costs have been rising at three times the general inflation rate for several years along with prescription drug price increases, and PwC is not immune to this trend. For the benefit plan year that started July 1, 2019 (FY20), we took steps to keep our medical plan premium increases well below the national average (staff experienced an increase of $1-$10 per pay period depending on medical plan/coverage level). In the prior plan year (FY19) there were no premium increases. PwC’s Health Research Institute projects a 6% increase in medical inflation cost trend in 2020 in the US, which is slightly higher than it’s been over the past two years1. More information is coming In April, you’ll receive more detailed information about the plans and cost changes effective July 1, 2020, and we’ll provide additional guidance and resources to help you make your benefits decisions. You’ll be able to enroll in or make changes to your medical, dental, vision and legal plan coverages as well as flexible spending accounts in May during the annual benefits enrollment period.

        <pwc_body>Top 10 savvy healthcare consumer habits Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Top 10 savvy healthcare consumer habits National Benefits Oct. 18, 2019 We all work hard and have many obligations outside of work — and we all need to take care of ourselves. That’s why PwC has made well-being a central part of Be well, work well and our Your Tomorrow commitment. One of the reasons we invest in Be well, work well and all of our well-being programs is to help address an issue that’s important to our business and to each of us personally — rising healthcare costs. While we know not all healthcare costs are tied to lifestyle factors, we can take advantage of Be well, work well resources to play an active role in our personal well-being — not only physically but mentally, spiritually and emotionally. This can help us stay healthy, reduce our personal spending on healthcare and improve our financial well-being. When we are savvy consumers of healthcare, we’re contributing to the ability to hold down future health plan cost increases. This is important to all of us at PwC because our healthcare plans are self-insured, which means they are designed and priced to reflect the actual claims and usage of our people. Medical costs have been rising at three times the general inflation rate nationally for several years now — and these trends are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Get started being a savvy healthcare consumer with these 10 habits. Top 10 savvy healthcare consumer habits 1. Take advantage of our Be well, work well resources. PwC offers many free programs that help support and manage your well-being. Check out the Be well, work well round-up for more information and visit The Well, your one-stop resource for all of our well-being, flexibility and protected time resources. The Well has everything you need to be your best self personally and professionally, including our new Be well, work well Team Plan Builder, which makes it even simpler to create your team plan by Nov. 27. 2. Access free emotional and mental health support. The Ginger Emotional Support app provides confidential emotional health support for each of us and our family members (age 18+) at no cost. Live coaches can chat with you on demand via the app anytime, anywhere. It's free, convenient and completely confidential. And, the firm offers six free mental health visits through LiveWell Resources. 3. Get routine and preventive care. The best medicine is prevention. Our medical, dental and vision care plans all offer routine or preventive services, some at no cost and others with low copays or coinsurance, and in some cases no deductible. See the information in the Be well, work well round-up regarding Executive Health Exams and review the healthcare plan summaries via Me@PwC. 4. Take advantage of tax savings through Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs). If you’re enrolled in these accounts, you save money for current and future healthcare expenses because of their tax advantages. If you’re a PwC UnitedHealthcare (UHC) medical plan participant, you can start or increase HSA contributions at any time via Benefits Express. You can change FSA contributions or enroll during the Annual Enrollment period in May, unless you have a life event like getting married or having a baby (staff only). Check out the How to Use your HSA video and Flexible Spending Account video to learn more. 5. Know your plan. Do you know what your coinsurance, deductible and maximum out-of-pocket expenses are for your plan? Check out these videos to learn more and review the summaries on Me@PwC. 6. Stay in the network. To help you save money, our healthcare plans provide access to a network of doctors, facilities and pharmacies. These doctors and facilities agree to accept a discounted rate for covered services. The plans offer the flexibility to see out-of-network doctors, but you’ll typically pay more. If you're enrolled in a PwC medical plan and expect to have substantial care such as surgery with a doctor or services at a facility that is not in the UHC network, it's a good idea to get an estimated cost before your procedure. Submitting the UHC Out-of-Network Pricing Request Form is an efficient way to know how much you're going to need to pay out of pocket before you receive the service so you can avoid being surprised by larger than expected expenses. Visit myuhc.com to search for doctors and quality ratings. 7. Use the right level of care. When you need care, think about the right type of care for your situation. Could you use a virtual visit instead of going to the doctor’s office? (Virtual visits are available via myuhc.com or the Health4Me app.) Is an urgent care clinic a better option than an ER for less serious issues? Be sure to get the care you need for your circumstances and personal situation. 8. Check out labs before you go. Blood work and lab services can be very expensive. Check with your doctor and before you go to the lab, make sure it’s part of the UHC network (LabCorp and Quest are both in-network labs with UHC). 9. Ask about generics and preferred brands, and use mail order for long-term medications. Generic drugs typically cost less and can be equally effective as brand name medications for most people, so talk to your doctor when you get a prescription. Consider the “preferred brands” available at a lower cost under the plan if a generic is not available. Remember, using mail order for maintenance medication is convenient and can save you money. Go to Express Scripts for more information. 10. Use the tools and resources. There are lots of resources and information available to help you make the most of your benefits. Go to myuhc.com to find doctors and resources, review the plan summary sheets at Me@PwC, visit HQ and Benefits Express, and watch the videos to learn more about your benefit options.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Protect yourself from identity theft and get rewarded, too National Benefits Jan. 3, 2020 Every two seconds there’s a new victim of identity theft, so protecting your personal information is more important than ever. To help safeguard you from this very real danger, PwC pays the cost of identity theft protection for you with Identity Guard. If you haven’t registered for this benefit yet, do it today. PwC pays for Identity Guard® Gold Service Plan, which includes: 24/7 monitoring of your Social Security number, credit cards and bank accounts Three-bureau credit monitoring, plus a monthly credit score and report update Lost wallet protection $1 million identity theft insurance Identity theft victim recovery services Mobile apps: Anti-Phishing and Identity Guard provide access to your Identity Guard account on-the-go SaferPass password manager — for personal accounts only. For PwC information, use our firm-approved password manager, 1Password. Purchase additional identity theft protection for yourself and family members Beyond the identity theft protection that PwC provides through the Identity Guard Gold Plan, you can register for enhanced coverage for yourself and your family, for a nominal additional monthly charge billed to your credit card. Review the Identity Guard® brochure and FAQs for more information. Register for identity theft monitoring To get the most from the program, registration is required so Identity Guard can start monitoring your personal information. (If you’ve already registered, you don’t need to register again.) When you register, you can also earn Well-Being Rewards points — just confirm your Identity Guard registration on the Well-Being Rewards site to receive 1,000 points (one-time limit). For security purposes, and to ensure Identity Guard is monitoring your personal information, you’ll need to provide your Social Security number and answer a few questions related to your credit file (for example, your mortgage amount or automobile loan amount). If you answer the security questions incorrectly, don’t worry. You can register again, but you must wait at least 72 hours before you re-register. Register for identity theft monitoring here. For security reasons, we highly recommend you register on a PC or laptop, not on a mobile device. If you decide not to register for the identity theft protection services paid for by PwC, you are still eligible for Identity Guard’s Victim Recovery Service if you become a victim of identity theft. For more information, call 1-866-324-3159.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Take your car to the (insurance) limit National Benefits Sept. 17, 2019 If you use your car for firm business or are covered by PwC’s Personal Liability Umbrella Insurance Program, you need to maintain the minimum coverage limits necessary to protect yourself from potential financial liabilities. Check your policies today, and make the necessary changes to protect yourself. Firm business auto policy minimum coverage limits When you drive your personal car, coverage may be afforded for an accident that takes place while conducting PwC business. A general rule of thumb is that, if you can claim mileage reimbursement for the trip, it likely constitutes driving on firm business. (Note: commuting to and from the office does not constitute using a personal vehicle for firm business.) Each year, you are required to confirm that you maintain a minimum auto insurance coverage level of: · $100,000/$300,000 for bodily injury and $50,000 for property damage OR · $300,000 combined If you’re involved in an accident and you are found liable, your personal auto insurance covers the first $100,000 (or $300,000). Firm insurance covers anything above this minimum amount. If you don’t have the minimum coverage amounts, you could have a gap in insurance that you would be responsible for paying personally. Note, the firm’s coverage does not cover physical damage (collision or comprehensive) to the partner / staff's vehicle; it only covers third party bodily injury and property damage. Additional information for senior managers, directors, managing directors and partners: The Personal Liability Umbrella Insurance Policy (Umbrella Policy) is automatically provided to senior managers, directors, managing directors and partners. The cost of this policy is paid by the firm. It provides additional insurance for your cars (and homes), but you are required to maintain a higher minimum coverage level: · $250,000/$500,000 for bodily injury and $50,000 for property damage OR · $300,000 combined Your personal auto insurance covers the first $250,000 (or $300,000) and the Umbrella Policy covers anything above this amount (subject to Umbrella Policy maximums) if you are liable for an accident that occurs while using your car for business or personal use. If you're a senior manager or above, you should increase your current insurance to $250,000/$500,000 OR $300,000 if you currently only maintain personal coverage for $100,000/$300,000 on your car. If you don’t maintain the $250,000/$500,000 limit and you use your car for personal use, your personal insurance would cover the first $100,000. You would be responsible for the next $150,000, as there would be a gap in insurance that would be your responsibility to pay. The firm’s Umbrella Policy would then cover expenses above $250,000 (subject to limits). Access PwC’s Home and Auto Insurance Program for quotes PwC’s Home &amp; Auto Insurance Program, administered by Hub Int’l, provides eligible partners and staff access to group auto and home insurance payable through payroll deductions. These policies include the required underlying limits. Available independence-cleared carriers include: · Chubb Personal Insurance (“Chubb”); · MetLife Home &amp; Auto (“MetLife”); · Liberty Mutual Auto and Home Voluntary Benefits (“Liberty Mutual”); · The Travelers Indemnity Company (“Travelers”); · Privilege Underwriters Reciprocal Exchange (“PURE”); and · Cincinnati Ins.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Better vision, clear costs, can’t lose National Benefits Oct. 25, 2019 Every day, we spend hours looking at our laptops, reading from our tablets and gazing at our phones. The fatigue this places on our eyes, coupled with the fact that our eyes are always changing, makes regular vision exams an essential component of our personal well-being. PwC’s EyeMed vision care plan and the new Know Before You Go cost transparency tool can help us stay healthy and manage our personal healthcare spending. Know Before You Go If you’re enrolled in PwC’s vision care plan, consider scheduling an eye exam – you’re eligible for one each year. The plan also includes a Video Display Terminal benefit for partners and staff (not available to covered dependents), which covers a screening, completed along with your regular exam, and lenses specifically designed to address eye strain and fatigue associated with computer use. While you’re considering making an appointment, think about how you can minimize your personal expenses. Search for an eye doctor with the location and hours that work for you. You’ll experience the greatest cost savings when you use EyeMed in-network providers. Your cost is also affected by whether you need contact lenses or glasses, and any special coatings or add-ons. Plus, while you’re logged into the EyeMed site, you can find additional savings opportunities by clicking on “Special Offers” at the top of the page. To get a feel for the expenses you might incur before your appointment, log into the Know Before you Go tool and get an estimate. Log into your EyeMed account and click “Know Before You Go” in the top dropdown menu. Choose from exams and a variety of lens types, options and add-ons. Plus, get detailed descriptions of each product so you feel confident in your choices. View a range of costs based on your choices and vision benefits. If you’re not currently enrolled in vision care, you’ll have an opportunity to elect coverage during the Annual Enrollment period in May, for coverage effective July 1. Bonus: You can earn Well-Being Rewards points The Well-Being Rewards Program provides an added incentive of 300 points per year for having your routine eye exam. Remember, you’ll need to enter your exam details in the Virgin Pulse desktop site in order to claim your points. Questions For more information about how the plan works: Call an EyeMed representative at (877) PwC-1863 (877-792-1863). Visit the EyeMed website at eyemedvisioncare.com/pwc.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Help hack-proof your passwords Network Information Security Oct. 8, 2019 Cybercriminals can crack a weak password in seconds. And reusing passwords leaves you even more vulnerable if one account is compromised. So how do you thwart the bad guys? Be sure to create a unique password for each account — no recycling! And yes, that includes just changing one number. If your account comes with a default password, change it right away. If available, enable two-factor authentication. You can manage all your passwords using our firm-provided password manager, 1Password. What makes a password hard to hack? Longer is stronger. Use uppercase and lowercase characters, numerals and special characters. Passphrases can be more secure than randomized passwords and are easier to remember. Unrelated words or phrases make strong passwords (e.g., “World$Cup$candle$dog” or “Peanut!Ball!Boat!Car”). What to avoid User IDs and other personal information (name, birthday, places you’ve lived, sports teams, etc.) Common words, phrases, abbreviations and related words like “PricewaterhouseCoopers1” or “FallOfTwentyNineteen1” Words spelled backwards or common misspellings Sequences or repeated characters (12345678, 222222, abcdefg, qwerty) Test your passwords — but do it the right way Type a password into the PwC Password Checker to assess its strength, plus find out how many times it’s been compromised in the past. But don’t use just any password checker — others may actually reside on malicious websites. Learn more by reviewing our Password Guidance or by visiting the Information Security Awareness site. If you think your password and/or GUID may have been compromised, change it immediately and contact PwC’s Cybersecurity Incident Response Team. Visit PwC’s Service Hub for support on passwords including your GUID, mobile devices, PwC applications and more. For help managing your passwords, check out the firm provided tool 1Password.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Social engineering: Understanding your digital presence Network Information Security Oct. 15, 2019 Websites visited, information submitted online, and personal information posted on social media creates a data trail unique to the user called a “digital footprint”. Even leaving comments on someone’s post contributes to that footprint, and with other items that can be gathered such as locations visited, hobbies, work, and relationships...cyber criminals can piece together an unsuspecting victim’s life. Often people have a tendency to overshare information, and cyber criminals can use a digital footprint to create a profile on an individual. Using that profile, they can craft convincing lures through social engineering tactics by impersonating a colleague, a friend, or family member to gain the trust of the individual. The cyber criminals’ goal is often to steal business or personal information for financial gain. Be aware of the information you create and post online. Assume anything you post online is potentially viewable to anyone on the internet. Here are some tips to help clean up and protect your digital footprint: Review your privacy settings. Spend some time getting to know profile privacy settings on social media platforms that allow you to control who sees your posts on your social media streams. Create strong, memorable passwords. Anytime you need a password, create one that uses a combination of words, numbers, symbols, and upper- and lowercase letters. If an account allows, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). Keep all your software up to date. Many viruses and malware programs are specifically designed to “mine” your digital footprint. Updating your software can help protect against this. Review your mobile use: if you don’t need it, delete it. From time to time, review the apps on your phone or tablet. What are their privacy or information-sharing settings? If you don’t use an app anymore, think about deleting it. Watch the video Wrong Connection: A Social Engineering Story to learn more.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname That email may not be what it seems — stay vigilant Network Information Security Oct. 1, 2019 It’s Security Awareness Month! We’ll be sharing some of our best tips to help you protect yourself, the firm, our clients and our data. Remember, you are our first line of defense. First up: Do you know how to spot Business Email Compromise? Business Email Compromise (BEC) is an advanced cybersecurity scam that capitalizes on a brief moment of inattention or tricks you to act too quickly. BEC can take various forms. In most cases, cybercriminals compromise legitimate email accounts of people who approve payments or access sensitive information. For example, cybercriminals have posed as PwC partners/staff and sent emails to our clients that appear to come from PwC. Techniques include online ploys such as spear-phishing, social engineering, identity theft, email spoofing and the use of malware. Perpetrators are so practiced at their craft that the deception is often difficult to uncover until it is too late. Remember: Stay alert. A BEC attack could be directed at you. Scrutinize email, texts, calls, in-app messages (e.g., WhatsApp) and social media. Share your knowledge. While we can’t predict who or how criminals will attack, we do know that anyone could be a victim. Share this info with others, including clients who could be targets by cyber criminals trying to gain insight into the client’s relationship with PwC. Report it. If an email looks suspicious, use the PwC Phish Reporter button in your Google mail. Want more info?

Important changes for removable USBs Network Information Security Oct. 25, 2019 Most of us already use one of the firm’s secure data transmittal and collaboration tools. But if you’re using a firm-issued thumb drive or external hard drive with your PwC laptop, here’s what you should know about this update to our removable media policy: Starting Nov. 7, you’ll no longer be able to read or copy files from existing firm-issued USB devices. Copy any files to your laptop before Nov. 7. If you need to continue working with a USB or hard drive, no problem — you just need the right device. More information about ordering a new device is available here. (Older firm-issued removable media devices are software encrypted; the new hardware encrypted devices you can order are more secure.) Saving files to removable media continues to be disabled, per the change in policy we announced last year. You may receive additional guidance specific to your line of service. This may include additional actions for those with an exception to use removable media. How do I request an exception? If you have a valid business case that requires the ability to save or read files to removable media and cannot leverage any of our standard collaboration tools, complete this short form to request an exception. It may take up to four business days to review your request. Learn more about the exception request process. What should I do with my current device? We recommend that you return your old devices to Office Technology Support at any PwC office. Our teams will recycle the devices and make sure that any data on the device is destroyed. Questions?

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Top Policy Trends 2020: What your clients need to know Marketing &amp; Sales Dec. 12, 2019 Policy uncertainty is beginning to lift and businesses need to be prepared for a changing regulatory climate. Top Policy Trends 2020 gives our clients insight into the policies and influencers to watch across the seven most important policy areas that will impact their businesses, plus a recent C-suite poll sheds light on executives’ perspective. A presidential election year guarantees policy attention. Some policies are moving swiftly, while others are in the early stages: Data privacy: Concerns about privacy are now centered around the collection, storage and security of data, especially as consumers call for more transparency around their own data. Trade: Tensions continue between the US and China, but the strategy will be shifting focus to supply chain diversity. Digital Services Tax: The rising number of digital services taxes are in response to companies having “scale without mass.” Until countries come to a consensus on dealing with the shifting digital economy, these taxes are likely here to stay. Healthcare: Presidential candidates will continue to debate the prospect of Medicare for All, but healthcare regulation will center on pricing transparency and drug pricing reform. Antitrust: Antitrust investigations into Big Tech will have a trickle-down effect for other industries, especially those that rely on an advertising model. Artificial Intelligence: AI is here and regulators are playing catch-up, with cities and states regulating the technology on an application-specific basis. But sweeping regulation will be about protecting society from negative effects like algorithmic bias. Workforce: Developments in workforce policy are changing the relationship between employer and employee as the digital revolution allows for business models that rely on more flexible employment terms. Produced by our Risk &amp; Regulatory platform team, the annual report and C-suite poll (below) highlight influencers to watch and the regulatory shifts businesses should know about. Share our perspectives with clients, so they know we’re prepared to help them navigate change. These conversation starters can help us get up to speed quickly, share our perspective and bring insights from our platforms in ways that are appropriate for our audit and non-audit clients.

Access the PwC Holiday eCard site, then follow the instructions to search for and select your contacts from those who are already loaded into the site.

        <pwc_body>New widgets and Einstein Analytics dashboards hit Salesforce this week Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname New widgets and Einstein Analytics dashboards hit Salesforce this weekend Marketing &amp; Sales Oct. 31, 2019 The Salesforce enhancements coming on Monday, Nov. 4 will help you make faster, data-driven decisions with new insights on the Contact, Account and Opportunity pages and a standard set of easy-to-use dashboards powered by Einstein Analytics. While these upgrades are being made, Salesforce will be unavailable from Friday, Nov. 1 at 8 p.m. ET to Sunday, Nov. 3 at noon ET. This December will mark the two-year anniversary of our Salesforce launch. You know that using the tool helps you communicate better across your teams, saving you time and helping you deliver a better One Firm client experience. As new functionality is incorporated, you should stay focused on Tim’s three key actions to get even more out of Salesforce. Keep using Chatter to share insights, include contacts on opportunities (relating yourself to contacts and logging meetings), and make sure information is current. When everyone works in Salesforce, we capture information that helps predict trends and gives us greater insights across the firm. New widgets to reinforce our key ways of working: Contact pages: Highlighting a Contact’s relationships and activities, this widget gives you an overview of the Contact’s relationship strength and interactions. Opportunity Completeness: Housed at the top of all Opportunity pages, this widget provides a “Completeness Score” indicating how many of the required fields and highly suggested fields have been populated. You can update fields directly from the widget to boost your score and provide valuable data. Client pages: This widget provides quick insight into the pipeline, wins and activities at the Client level. Einstein Analytics dashboards Following a successful pilot, we will make Einstein Analytics available to most Salesforce license holders (Core Attest, admins and interns who use Salesforce will not have access). Einstein Analytics is Salesforce’s enhanced dashboarding tool, simplifying how we access data visualization and insights. Einstein Analytics is particularly valuable to those who team across multiple accounts, as a simple flip of the filter moves from one client view to the next, providing the same information in a consistent fashion. You can easily filter to get the slice of information you need and then save your view to quickly see it again later or share with others. You’ll also benefit from a tool that is centrally managed and updated. Access our Einstein Analytics US/MX Landing page now, and check out this Cheat Sheet to get started quickly.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Scratch starting from scratch with 50+ new proposal templates Marketing &amp; Sales Oct. 28, 2019 If you’re still building your proposals from the ground up, or from the last proposal on your hard drive, consider using a Proposal on Demand (PoD) to jump start your next one. Our new templates, available through our Proposal Center of Excellence storefront, can help you begin with a proposal that’s already 30%, 50%, or even 80% complete — rather than starting from scratch. Our PoD templates quickly serve up frequently-used content and messaging that we know has resulted in wins with other clients. The templates are branded and fully customizable to your client’s needs. And, because the content is developed with and approved by senior leaders from each practice, you’ll know you’re sharing your leadership’s best-in-class thinking. With the basic elements of a proposal in place from the start — such as an executive summary, qualifications, approach, team org charts and fee tables — your team can focus directly on tailoring the response to your client’s specific needs. With more than 50 templates already live, we have a PoD for approximately a third of the services in the firm’s Salesforce pipeline — representing nearly $2.8 billion in potential revenue. And we're expanding our PoD portfolio every day. Where can you find a Proposal on Demand? PoDs are available through our Proposal on Demand homepage. PoDs are organized by LoS, key One Firm offerings (Platforms, Integrated Solutions) and sectors. While you’re on the site, get familiar with the resources available through our Proposal Center of Excellence to drive your pursuit needs. Services include proposal management, proposal writing, document coordination, digital solutions and self-service options. A cyber team traveling under a tight deadline was able to pull together a completed proposal draft in under two hours while on a plane and enroute to the client, and shared this feedback on using one of our PoDs: “I wanted to let you know that last Friday I leveraged the PoD for a last-minute proposal I had to draft and it saved me a lot of time. I did not have to work all weekend and was able to turn the deck around quickly.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Honoring Dr. King by being a voice for change Tim Ryan Jan. 17, 2020 Team - On Monday, we mark Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, and we honor a purpose-led leader who drove change in our country by challenging traditional thinking, calling out bias and tackling difficult conversations head-on. Dr. King not only had a vision for the future, he also brought people together to drive change and make his dream a reality. As we remember Dr. King, I want to update you on the ways that we are taking action and coming together with others to continue to make meaningful progress on diversity and inclusion within our firm and across the business community. Please click here for more about the actions you can take to honor Dr. King through volunteering and service. About a year ago, to honor our colleague Bo Jean, we worked with the CEO Action coalition to lead the way on the first Day of Understanding. Over 150 organizations and tens of thousands of people at PwC took part in discussions about unconscious bias, inclusion and understanding the experiences of diverse colleagues. It was an inspiring day! In 2020, we’re going to participate in the next Day of Understanding and accomplish even more. This won’t be just one day: Throughout February and into early March, we’re going to create opportunities within PwC to talk to each other about important but difficult topics like race, gender and religious inclusion. Having these conversations helps us understand each other better, be better colleagues and bring the best of ourselves to solving problems. We know that everyone is busy, so the approach is flexible and leverages technology. We’ll release a series of podcasts and conversation guides so that groups and teams can have conversations on topics that are important to them and at times that work for them — whether that’s one discussion or several. While we've talked about differences before at PwC, the podcasts will help us go deeper on challenging topics. For example, a recent external report highlighted the differences between the experiences of Black and White professionals in the workplace. We'll talk about what it’s like to be Black in corporate America and ways to foster more inclusive cultures. Another podcast will explore religious inclusion through experiences of our colleagues and how -- at times -- it can impact their authentic selves at work. These discussions will be a starting point that we’ll build on throughout the year with new ideas to help us grow as inclusive leaders and an even more inclusive firm. Of course, taking the time to learn more about others and listen to their experiences is something we can do anytime at PwC. We’ve learned that when we focus on taking action together, we have a greater impact — so we’ve chosen to align these discussions with our peers in CEO Action and during Black History Month in February and the time leading up to International Women’s Day in early March. We’re also helping to expand the impact of the Day of Understanding in the business community by bringing even more organizations on board. Similar to last year, our firm will take a leadership role, sharing resources to assist other organizations in holding these discussions. Given the growth in the CEO Action coalition, we expect even more organizations, including many of our clients, to join us this year and hold discussions over the month of February. Many of us have talked with our clients about diversity and inclusion, and this is an opportunity to continue those conversations. Team, we are at the start of a new year that is full of possibilities for us. My hope for us in 2020 is that we continue to grow as an organization that takes on big issues and makes a fundamental difference in the lives of our people, our clients and our communities. The Day of Understanding is a great example of what it means to be purpose-led and how our individual actions add up to something bigger. Please watch for the resources that will be coming in PwC Inside and on HQ. These conversations are an opportunity to be our best selves, to be a voice of change, and to help our firm continue to grow as a place where everyone can be themselves and feel a sense of belonging.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Remembering and honoring Bo Tim Ryan Sept. 5, 2019 Team, It was one year ago when we were devastated by the killing of our colleague Bo Jean. Many of us are thinking of Bo and his family today. That includes his colleagues in Dallas and our Risk Assurance practice who are honoring Bo through community service and wearing #belikebo shirts to remember Bo’s life and example. Later this month, the Dallas office will be unveiling a portrait of Bo at a ceremony attended by Bo’s family. We’ve stayed in touch with Bo’s family over the past year. They are remembering him this month both privately and with an event to celebrate his life and support the foundation they created in his name. The Botham Jean Foundation focuses on causes that were important to Bo including racial unity and caring for those who are less fortunate. We’ve contributed to the foundation as a firm and as individuals. Last year, with the support of many people across the firm, we also established a scholarship in Bo’s honor at Harding University’s College of Business. The scholarship will help other promising young people pursue their education and their dreams. Harding University students Yui Kondo, Tonio Montez, Brittany Tate and Courtney Porter are the first four recipients chosen to receive the scholarship set up to honor Bo’s life and enhance his legacy. They were chosen for their excellent academic performance and leadership. If you wish to honor Bo with a contribution to the scholarship or the Botham Jean Foundation, you may do so through Impact Space. All eligible donations to the scholarship fund at Harding University will be matched by PwC, and, as always, 100% of your donations through this site will go to the charity (no fees). If you’re interested in other ways to carry forward Bo's legacy, consider mentoring a student in Bo's honor by visiting our Access Your Potential Mentor Hub. As we remember Bo and think of his family today, I hope you join me in celebrating and honoring Bo for how he lived. Bo was a person who lifted others up, who reached across differences, and who took care of his family, friends and community. He continues to be an inspiring example for all of us to follow.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Small steps, big impact, lots of gratitude Tim Ryan Nov. 26, 2019 Team, What inspires me and humbles me every week are the people and teams of PwC. Little successes happen every day, and they show us that together we can get anything done. Together, we serve our clients and make our firm better. We support and care for each other. We bring financial and tech skills to our underrepresented communities. We give to causes we care about and support each other’s causes. Over the last three weeks we’ve had lots of these little successes. We collectively took 43,594 steps towards our well being, enhancing our digital skills and leveling up in Digital Lab. The firm is going to match each of those steps and round up a bit to give 100,000 meals to those in need through Feeding America. That means individuals and families who don’t always know where their next meal is coming from will have food on the table – something that’s easy to take for granted. Helping others is such a powerful way to give thanks for the good in our own lives. On behalf of all the partners, thank you for taking part in Firm to Table and for everything you do to make a difference each day. We hope you enjoy the long weekend and the time to focus on the things in your life that you are most grateful for.

Tim Ryan Dec. 20, 2019 A message from Tim Team, On a recent flight I spent time thinking about the past year and what’s coming next. I’m feeling great about what’s coming in 2020 – and that’s because of all of you. Over the past year I’ve had many opportunities to meet people across the firm and to talk with our clients about the work we are doing. And what I see makes me very proud. Your excitement about the future. It’s been a privilege to meet with teams this year who could not wait to demonstrate what they are doing with our digital tools or the progress they are making on their engagements. I’m proud of these teams not only for making a difference for our clients – but because they are grabbing the opportunity to build skills and create even more opportunities for themselves. Standing for what is right. Thousands of you each day are making a difference by performing quality work and adding value to our clients. I’m proud of our teams who live our value of integrity, stand for doing the right thing and have the confidence to consult and not go it alone. And I’ve also had many conversations with our audit and non-audit clients telling me about teams who have pulled together to meet tough deadlines and overcome challenges, while always delivering quality. Leading by example in the business community and within PwC. At our recent CEO Action Summit it was an honor to represent our firm and share our experiences, lessons learned and commitment to diversity and inclusion with 150 CEOs and 300 CHROs and CDOs. I’m proud that our firm is recognized as a leader, and equally proud as I travel around and see the many ways that people at PwC show their caring, create an environment where everyone can feel they belong and open the door to opportunities for others. Team, each and every day, I see how committed you are and how you live our values. And that makes me incredibly optimistic about the year ahead. I’ve shared just a few of the thousands and thousands of good “things” that have happened this year. And at the end of this busy and successful year, we should all take some time to appreciate and celebrate the good things that are happening. As we go off for our well-deserved break, I speak for all of our partners when I say thank you for everything you do for PwC, our clients and our communities. We hope for the health and well-being of you and your loved ones in 2020. We hope you know how appreciated you are. And we hope that each one of you truly knows you’re making a difference.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Marching to the beat of inclusion, digital enablement with HBCUs Tim Ryan Oct. 10, 2019 Team, I had the opportunity to spend a day at Howard University this week. The Howard community’s sense of mission, focus on solving human problems and educating and developing future leaders was inspiring. When I’m on campus I spend a lot of time listening — and what I heard is Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are looking for businesses like PwC to invest in their students and their mission. What I shared in return in my discussions with students, faculty and administrators is that we also have a strong sense of mission at PwC. As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, diversity and inclusion is a defining issue for us — and it goes hand-in-hand with our commitment to upskilling and investing in people. We’re delivering on that commitment in very concrete ways through our growing relationship with Howard and 34 other HBCUs. This summer we held our first HBCU Faculty Forum, where we shared the importance of incorporating digital skills for their students into their curriculums. We’ve made our Digital Fitness App available to professors to support their upskilling and offered them the opportunity to attend our two-day analytics academies free of charge. We’re also investing in students. This year, we awarded $150,000 in HBCU scholarships. We’re also working with HBCU alumni at PwC to reach and recruit graduates, and to empower them with the knowledge of job opportunities that are available to them and the skills they need to help them be successful. And we are exploring ways to prepare incoming hires from HBCUs and help them build relationships with our people so they can experience an even greater sense of belonging once they’re part of PwC. Team, we continue to look for new ways to enhance our inclusive culture and this is a great example. We’re hiring from five times more HBCU sources than we were two years ago and have seen a 72% increase in hires year over year. We’re far from done but, with your support, we’re making progress. One of the reasons we’re able to attract talented students from HBCUs, and from schools all across the country, is because of the many people at PwC who do so much to support our recruiting efforts. THANK YOU to everyone who is out on campus helping to show future PwCers why they belong at PwC. And if you want to learn more (or help) with our growing relationships at HBCUs, please get in touch with Andrew Mansaray.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Where we’re headed in FY20 and how we’ll recognize your contributions Tim Ryan Oct. 17, 2019 Team, We just wrapped up meetings with the partners to talk about our strategy and the actions we’ll take in FY20. Now I want to share these updates with you because the strength of our business matters to all of us – from the opportunities we have, to our ability to reward you for your contributions. Here are some of the key things we talked about. Our business is strong. We had a good year in FY19, and that trend continues in FY20. For the first quarter, firmwide revenues of $4 billion are 2.7% ahead of budget. While it’s still early in the year, all three Lines of Service are showing good momentum and growing ahead of plan, with our bottom line profitability also trending positively. Our strategy is working. We’re running our business well, we’re continuing to focus on One Firm teamwork and we’ve made tremendous progress on bringing Your Tomorrow to life. And we’ll build on that in FY20 so we keep getting better. Please read my FY20 Strategy letter, which captures the progress we made in FY19 and previews what’s ahead. We’re transforming our firm, step by step. Our success over the last few years is the result of a lot of hard work and all of us getting on board to do our part. We know this is hard but it’s also exciting. We’ve broken our journey up into smaller steps that we take together — and those steps add up to big progress. Together we’re changing our firm so that we secure the future and continue to provide great opportunities for FY20 as well as 10, 15, 20 years from now. Please plan to join the firmwide Town Hall on October 30 at 4 p.m. ET. I’m excited to talk with you about our next steps, which include more opportunities to learn, make a difference and support each other in being our best. (It should already be on your calendar -- but if you don’t see it, click here. When our business does well, we have the ability to reward you and invest for the future. Today Wes, Roy, Mohamed and Jim will have an update on our progress so far in FY20 — and they’ll provide you with a look at the bonus ranges for our FY20 performance bonus plan. Funding of the FY20 bonus pool is based on our collective ability to achieve the business goals that drive the firm’s overall success. Team, we’re in this together, so we all need to know the plan and do our part. Please read my FY20 strategy letter and plan to join our firmwide Town Hall Oct. 30!

        <pwc_body>CEO Insights - July 2019 Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname CEO Insights - July 2019 Tim Ryan July 29, 2019 Team, One of the privileges we have as part of PwC is seeing our clients’ businesses and getting a firsthand understanding of how the business world works -- and the challenges business leaders are thinking about. In my experience, our clients are hungry to hear our views on what’s happening in business. Of course, we don’t share confidential information. But as we do work for multiple clients, we have insights to share. What I do several times a year is reflect on the themes coming out of my conversations with CEOs and share these with my contact list of CEOs and others to give them insight into what other leaders are collectively focused on. I just sent my latest note to more than 1,000 business leaders. I also share this with our partners, and with all of you, to help you with your own client conversations. Please see my note below -- I hope you’ll find this helpful! And if you want to share with your clients, I’ve also posted my observations on LinkedIn. CEO Insights - July 2019 The best part of my job is getting to speak to CEOs and business leaders from a variety of sectors, industries and countries. Through our conversations, I’m able to get a good sense of CEO sentiment as well as identify the macro trends impacting all types of businesses and industries. Overall, I believe CEO sentiment is positive. But when you drill down, that positive outlook is pointed at the things that executives can control. On the things that can’t be controlled -- the economy, trade, regulation, etc. -- the outlook isn’t as optimistic. With that said, businesses aren’t standing still. If business executives have demonstrated anything over the last few years, it is that worrying about what you can’t control is not productive and energy is best focused on the things that can be controlled. As a result, most executives would classify the environment as “glass is half full.” Here are five key business trends that CEOs should keep in mind as they focus on what they can control: 1. Despite market uncertainty, organic growth goals remain high Even though CEOs can clearly see the economic headwinds that are on the horizon -- with growing trade tensions and market uncertainty -- most of the ones I’ve spoken with remain optimistic about their own companies’ growth potential. In fact, many have very aggressive organic growth targets despite knowing that supply in many cases is outstripping demand and that competition has become more cutthroat than ever. CEOs are realistic and know they’re going to have to fight for market share. And with 91% of US CEOs confident that their companies will grow organically in the next 12 months (according to the most recent PwC CEO Survey), we’ll likely see more battles for market share, where companies with the lowest cost and best value will win. As a result, CEOs and C-Suite leaders are laser-focused on improving the cost of their products and services, increasing their value proposition and improving their customer experience. This will be especially important if the economy turns and companies may no longer have the pricing power they once had. 2. Be nimble and move quickly: To win market share, CEOs must lead change efforts with intensity and urgency There is a wide range in intensity when it comes to how different companies and their respective leaders are responding to this more challenging business environment. Some companies are quickly adapting and changing, while others are moving much slower than expected. But the common trait among those companies moving quickly is the engagement and focus of the CEO. As one CEO said to me recently, “Let’s face it -- what people really want to do is get to their office and simply do their work the same way they did it yesterday.” This insight perfectly illustrates how behavior gets entrenched and how change often has to be driven from the top down. Indeed, CEOs need to be a “force of nature” in shifting the organizational and cultural behaviors responsible for preventing change from taking hold. I personally believe that this is a big opportunity for CEOs. They can take charge and be even more forceful in driving change within and across their company. This is especially true in a tougher economic climate, where greater reward will go to the CEOs and companies that achieve better execution versus the ones that just design the perfect strategy. Speed is the name of the game. As leaders, CEOs need to not only drive change with intensity, but also do it fast. The world is only going to continue to throw us curveballs, whether they be tariffs and trade conflicts, regulatory uncertainty, or market volatility. The key to overcoming these challenges is to build your organization’s ability to be nimble and to adapt quickly. 3. Are you getting the right return for your IT and technology spend? We are seeing a continued high level of spending on IT and emerging technology at most companies. New CRM, human capital and finance systems along with AI and data analytic platforms provide great promise of efficiencies, quicker data for making better and faster business decisions, more collaboration to better serve customers, and increased employee productivity. But unfortunately in many cases these aspirations are not being fully realized. Why? Many companies are implementing large-scale technology solutions but underestimating the behavioral and cultural changes that need to be managed with new technology. What do I mean? One CEO said to me that they invested in a new CRM system but underestimated the desire of middle and line personnel to simply do work the way they always did (meaning they did not embrace the new technology, but rather simply continued to use their legacy practices, spreadsheets and communications). The CEO surmised “we bought and paid for world class technology, but didn’t show our people how to work and manage differently” and therefore, “we didn’t achieve the benefits and ROI that was expected.” Major IT projects need active involvement by the C-Suite as well as the right amount of time invested in the change management around the system or technology being implemented. 4. Invest in “citizen-led” innovation and change We are seeing some companies invest in digital upskilling and teaching their employees, by the thousands, new skills such as data wrangling, data visualization, bot building and data automation, to name a few. What companies are discovering is that by teaching their employees in sales, finance, accounting, human capital and the back office these new skills, the workforce can then apply those skills to automating and reimagining their day-to-day work tasks. This can help create capacity for growth without adding headcount. Based on what we have seen from our own experiences, we are of the view that there are billions of dollars of cost savings to be achieved in corporate America if employees are given new skills. Similarly, we have seen that teaching these skills to large percentages of the entire employee base builds loyalty and can serve both to help attract and retain talent in what is only going to be a continuing tight labor market. 5. Investors are closely watching management’s ability to execute Most importantly, the investor community sees all the challenges and opportunities that companies and CEOs are facing -- and they’re making their investment decisions accordingly. While some companies will survive and thrive, others companies that are not able to remain competitive will become targets of activist investors and M&amp;A. And, of course, a major root cause of not being able to stay competitive is the effectiveness and speed of change that CEOs are responsible for leading. Investors are looking to invest in companies where the CEOs have the skills to lead change and transformation. They are looking closely at the quality and speed with which company management is transforming the business. One major investor shared with me that he is not looking to invest in companies with management teams that have the highest external profiles. Instead, he is looking to invest in companies with CEOs who are focused on the guts of the business because that is what matters. Companies that are going to be rewarded by investors are the ones that have CEOs and management teams who roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty in the change and transformation agenda.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Our work is behind the scenes but our impact is big: #auditorproud Tim Ryan Sept. 26, 2019 Team, One thing I'm incredibly proud of is the role that many of us play in the audit space. Quality information is the bedrock of rational decision-making in our market economy, and it provides a foundation for millions of people as they invest their money to save for a home, their kids’ education or retirement. There’s always room for continued improvement and vigilance in carrying out our role in financial reporting — and we are committed to that. But I believe we can and should tell the story of the important role we play in the capital markets and how we bring people and technology together to enhance audit quality and provide value-added insights to our clients. One of the ways we tell that story is through our annual quality report, which we released today: Our focus on audit quality—2019. Another way we talk about who we are is #AuditorProud day. Yesterday, across the firm, we celebrated the audit profession at PwC, joining with other groups and companies to show people — primarily students — the kinds of careers you can build in this profession and why our work is so important. To mark the occasion, I also shared my thoughts on my LinkedIn blog. But talking about what we do once a year isn’t enough. We have a strong story to tell about what we’ve accomplished with the tech-enabled audit, and we’re out there telling it. Led by our core Assurance partners, we’ve launched an initiative — Tomorrow's Audit, Today — to be more visible in the marketplace. Our significant investments in technology, together with digitally upskilling our people and our Acceleration Centers, make us unique. We are harnessing the power of humans and technology, and bringing the best of both worlds to enhance quality and deliver an unparalleled experience for our clients. Even though our work is behind the scenes, our impact is big. We’re part of an important and noble profession — so let’s continue to share our pride.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Standing together against hatred and violence Tim Ryan Jan. 7, 2020 Team, As we enter a new year, we hope for peaceful days ahead. Sadly, however, we continue to see reminders that peace, unity and understanding are things that we can’t just hope for, but which we must work for. Over the holidays we heard about ugly acts of intolerance and violence against the Jewish community that looked to instill fear and attack religious freedom. As a firm, we stand with those who condemn violence and hatred, and believe that all people should be able to freely, visibly and safely express their beliefs and identities -- and live without the threat of violence. We’ll continue to work to be a firm where everyone is valued for who they are. And, in 2020, we’ll continue to join with others who want to take action and make progress to promote mutual respect and inclusion.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Remembering colleagues lost on Sept 11 Tim Ryan Sept. 9, 2019 Team, It's been 18 years since Sept. 11, 2001 and it’s still an emotional day. We lost five colleagues that day. Kelly Booms, Dan Brandhorst, Brian Kinney, Pat Quigley and Jessica Sachs were on the planes that hit the World Trade Center. Given the size of our firm and our network, many of us will also be thinking of friends, family members or PwC alumni who also died that day. Every year we remember Kelly, Dan, Brian, Pat and Jessica, and we think of their families and the terrible loss they suffered. I also reflect on how our firm came together. PwCers helped each other when travelers were stranded after flights were grounded, and people across the firm gave to help the victims and their families — work which continues through our firm’s long relationship with the New York Police &amp; Fire Widows' &amp; Children's Benefit Fund. As memorials take place publicly and privately in New York, Boston, Washington and across the country, let’s think of Kelly, Jessica, Brian, Pat and Dan -- as well as all those who were lost or injured, and the brave responders who ran into the danger.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname CEO Action: 800+ CEOs, 100 tour stops, and the impact keeps growing! Tim Ryan Nov. 14, 2019 Team, We led the way on creating the CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion back in 2017. At the start, 175 CEOs came together and pledged to take steps to become more diverse and inclusive. Just two and a half years later, the CEOs of more than 800 companies and organizations, representing 85 industries, have joined us. Together we’re driving change with 93% of signatories enacting the pledge commitments. As the coalition grows, so does our impact. By standing together and sharing what we’ve learned, we’re prioritizing this issue within our organizations, driving sustainable change within our individual organizations and across the business community. This week, CEO Action for Diversity &amp; Inclusion hosted its third Closed-Door Session for CEOs, along with the annual Summit for CHROs and CDOs. CEO Action is also engaging the broader community through the nationwide unconscious bias awareness tour that has already reached tens of thousands. The Check Your Blindspots tour just made its 100th stop. So far, it’s reached 29 states, 73 cities and 20 colleges — as well as many of our offices and clients. In addition, the coalition will be holding a second “Day of Understanding.” This will build on what was accomplished last year when 150 organizations, representing 600,000+ people, held conversations about unconscious biases and differences in the workplace. Let’s continue the discussions with our clients about CEO Action and the importance of diversity and inclusion. One of the reasons the CEO Action coalition continues to grow is because we’re talking with our clients, sharing our experiences and and asking them to join us. To everyone who has connected with their clients on this — thank you! We’re building our brand and stronger professional relationships with organizations that share our values. Let’s continue to lead by example. I want to thank all of you who are helping us live up to our pledge commitments for our own firm. We all have a part to play in cultivating and sustaining an inclusive culture where everyone can be true to themselves, recognized and valued for who they are and realize a sense of belonging. We’re truly an organization that leads with its purpose and values. When people ask me what that means, I’m proud to tell them about our role in leading the business community to do better on one of the most important issues of our time.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname At PwC, we speak up Tim Ryan Jan. 14, 2020 Team, As a purpose-led, values-driven firm, we do business the right way. We are a firm where people speak up when they have concerns. We take those concerns seriously and handle them confidentially, meaning we discuss them only on a need-to-know basis. This matters because every organization has issues — and we’ve seen stories in the press of what happens when people don’t speak up when they have a concern. That’s why I want to remind you that if you experience or see situations that don’t reflect our values, we have resources to help.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Our continued focus on independence and objectivity Tim Ryan Nov. 21, 2019 Team, Independence, objectivity and quality are foundational to our brand and our role in the capital markets. We all have a role in protecting that foundation — no matter what part of the business we are in. While we have strong training and processes in place and people who strive to do the right thing each day, just one bad decision can hurt our brand and the business we’ve worked so hard to build. You might wonder how the things you do each day could affect our independence with our restricted clients. Let me give you a few examples: You may not serve an SEC-restricted client today, but you could tomorrow. You may come into contact with a restricted client in the course of a joint business relationship or when explaining technology options to our clients. You might be making a personal financial decision — obtaining a loan or opening a brokerage account, among many other decisions — that could impact your personal independence. We know this can be difficult, but independence and objectivity — in fact and appearance — are critical characteristics of our profession. And they’re everyone’s responsibility. To that end, we’re launching several important independence-related initiatives this month to continue to enhance our processes and provide us with additional training and support. While each will affect us differently depending on our roles, they’re critical to our business and you should be familiar with all of them. This special edition of PwC Inside provides the resources and information you’ll need. Here’s an overview of the proactive steps we’re taking. The articles below will help you learn more about which changes apply to you. Here’s what I’m asking you to do: If you provide non-audit services to US or Mexico SEC-issuer audit clients, please read below about the enhanced independence-related processes and reviews — and a limited number of services that we’ll stop providing to SEC-issuer audit clients. Read about the new training that’s coming — we’ll all need to complete training that is relevant for our role. Seniors and associates, learn about the transition to using Independence Checkpoint and enrolling eligible accounts in the Brokerage Simplification Program. Find out how we’re tech-enabling the way we finalize engagement letters and statements of work through Create (or via DocuSign). Remember, you never have to go it alone. If you need support with personal or engagement independence matters, help is available.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname US and Mexico: Three years together HQ News July 12, 2019 Three years ago, PwC US and PwC Mexico came together to create one firm. With our combined strength and resources, we’re bringing greater value to our clients and creating opportunities for our people. Teaming to deliver value to our clients. One of these cross-border success stories comes from our International Tax Qualitative Solutions team. Tax partners Lissett Tautfest, in Mexico City, and Justin Denworth and Darryl Wodecki in the US worked together to develop staff in Mexico to perform quantitative modeling to support our clients. By expanding the ITS-QS team into Mexico City, we were able to improve margins on the work we deliver to our clients, as well as respond to the increased client demand for quantitative modeling as a result of US tax reform. Lissett says, “Our staff in Mexico has shown agility, drive and an ability to work remotely with teams across the US, while learning both new technology and US tax technical skills. It’s a testament to what our people can do when presented with innovative and unfamiliar challenges.” Delivering deep local knowledge. Our strong presence in both the US and Mexico has been a differentiator when proposing to clients who do business across borders. For example, our firm now serves as auditors of Kansas City Southern Railway -- a transportation company with railway routes across the US and Mexico. According to engagement partner Christopher Briggs, our presence in both countries was one of the key reasons that Kansas City Southern chose to work with PwC. And earlier this year, we were chosen as global mobility providers for CEMEX, one of the largest companies in Mexico. The decision makers at CEMEX cited our track record in the broader tax area -- and our ability to field strong local teams in Mexico, the US and more broadly. Led by Tom Richards, with support from Alice Espinoza, the team includes PwC professionals from PwC Mexico, US, UK and Colombia. Opportunities for our people. The sharing of talent flows both ways between the US and Mexico. In the past year, we have had 75 international assignments between Mexico and the US, as well as many teams working together as we serve clients. The US and Mexico are also on a shared upskilling journey, using workflow and data visualization tools, as well as both building and using tools from the Digital Lab. As a result of upskilling, our teams in both the US and Mexico are using digital tools to add value for our clients. For example, the Advisory Finance practice in Mexico has been using Robotic Processing Automations to drive digital transformation by finding innovative ways to reduce costs, enhance quality and improve processing times for our clients in retail, health, telecommunications, financial and shared services. The Mexico Advisory Finance Practice has also teamed with the US and Acceleration Centers on projects for non-audit clients Ingredion and Pepsi. As we mark the third anniversary, we celebrate these and many other successes that come with serving clients together, sharing talent and bringing clients the benefits of deep knowledge and professional relationships on both sides of the border.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Remembering the person behind the verdict in Dallas Tim Ryan Oct. 1, 2019 Team, Earlier today, the jury returned the verdict in the trial of the former Dallas police officer who killed our colleague Botham Jean last year. Bo’s death was a heartbreak for many of us at PwC. While I hope the verdict provides some peace for his family and those who loved him, it doesn’t change the fact that Bo's life was cut much too short. My thoughts today are with Bo’s family who have demonstrated tremendous strength and grace in the most terrible of times. While nothing will bring Bo back, I’m asking all of us to remember the tremendous person we lost at the center of this, our friend and colleague. Bo is remembered as a person who was generous of spirit – giving of himself without reservation to his family, friends, colleagues, and community. As I reflect on his life and spirit, I think about what else we could learn. We know that racial tensions, discrimination and bias -- both conscious and unconscious -- continue to be problems in our country. And all of us have a role in making our country and workplace more inclusive for everyone. When we recognize and value the people around us for who they are and build connections through the experiences we have in common -- we are doing what Bo would have done. Bo would have been 28 this past Sunday. Let’s remember him and the life he lived and think about his family, friends and all those who are dealing with so many emotions. And for those who want to join with others to honor and remember Bo, please share your memories using #BeLikeBo.

PwC has invested $3 billion to upskill our entire global network through Your Tomorrow and hiring diverse, stand-out technologists to build the technology, services and products that will redefine our firm and support clients. In order to successfully empower our employees, our initiatives are inclusive, without regard to level, tenure, age, race, gender or role.

Our PwC US Women in Technology (WiT) network is made up of 2,800 digital and technical professionals from across the firm with even more ally opportunities. We welcome all PwC partners and staff to join our community and create a movement that will: Support diversity in technology Network, share ideas and foster inclusion and belonging Enable practitioners to grow their tech IQ by providing tools and assets Provide access to commercial opportunities Develop and engage advocates, mentors, sponsors and role models How you can get involved Visit our website to become a speaker, enhance your skill development and make an impact.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Working with Feeding America to end hunger Responsible Business Leadership Nov. 26, 2019 Thanks to our collective commitment to the Firm to Table challenge, we'll be donating thousands of meals through Feeding America this holiday season, but our contributions to Feeding America go much deeper. We've supported Feeding America's mission to drive transformational change by working to end hunger in America for several years, in many ways: The PwC Charitable Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity founded by and for the people of PwC and their communities, has contributed to Feeding America through: Multiple grants to support the food banks' community programs that target children and youth, such as Kids Café and after-school programs. Children from homes that lack access to food are more likely to experience poor classroom performance. Learning readiness is a critical element aligned with the Foundation's ongoing focus on education and helping students thrive academically. Funding for a study to jumpstart Feeding America’s efforts to scale up training that can help under-employed working families prepare for more financially stable employment. The firm’s work with Feeding America has created opportunities for our people to put their personal purpose into action. For example: We’ve done pro bono engagements with Feeding America over the years, advising them on how to enhance their logistics, which yielded an increased ability to deliver 400M more meals, and then looking at their supply chain so they could become more efficient and reinvest in feeding even more families. Earlier this year, we hosted a BXT session for Feeding America and discussed building a roadmap for recovering and distributing 5 billion pounds of food that might otherwise go to waste. Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and we look for opportunities to work with organizations like Feeding America where we can go beyond a single donation or interaction and drive lasting change. We’re feeding 100,000 families through Firm to Table and we’re also helping to strengthen a network that serves 40 million people and helps them meet one of their most basic needs: having enough to eat.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname The power of giving makes a world of difference Tim Ryan Oct. 1, 2019 Team, When we work for change it’s powerful, whether we’re helping our clients, volunteering in the community or giving to causes that are important to us. Together, we have the ability to make a world of difference — and at this time of year, we put an extra focus on our impact through giving. Giving back is something you can do right now. It only takes a few moments to put your personal touch on our value of caring and make a difference by giving through Impact Space. Last year, tens of thousands of us collectively contributed more than $34 million to causes we care about — by supporting each other’s crowdfunders, rebuilding communities after natural disasters, supporting youth education, and much more. As a purpose-led and values-driven firm, we want to contribute to solving some of society’s biggest problems. For many of us, that means addressing opportunity gaps that can prevent young people from succeeding. We know this issue is important to people at PwC because over half of the dollars contributed last year through Impact Space went to education-related nonprofits. With that in mind, here are two new and easy ways to make an impact: Tech Education Fund: By choosing this option, we can support a portfolio of charities addressing the opportunity gap by transforming tech education for students around the country — and unlock personalized monthly impact reports on how your support is being put to work! Pennies from Payroll: We can build momentum on addressing society's largest challenges by opting into donating the change from your paycheck to the PwC Charitable Foundation. The Foundation supports the people of PwC in times of need and invests in emerging solutions to society’s greatest challenges in education and humanitarianism. Giving is individual and personal — but when we give together our impact is magnified. Whether you give your time or financial resources, your generosity and leadership make a difference.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname We’re turning the lights out on climate change Responsible Business Leadership Sept. 24, 2019 Our purpose is to build trust and solve important problems, and climate change is an important problem — and we know it’s important to our people, too. So, what is the firm doing? We’ve been proactive in responding to climate change and in FY18 we achieved our goal of reducing the firm’s carbon footprint 45% against a 2007 baseline. Our carbon emissions primarily come from our air travel and the electricity we consume in our offices. We manage these in the following ways: Air travel: This is our single largest source of carbon emissions and can often rise with revenue. First, we try to reduce our air travel emissions whenever possible by using virtual connectivity tools like Google Meet or Webex. Second, we offset 100% of our air travel emissions — meaning, we pay for things that capture or store CO2, like tree reforestation in line with the global network’s environment ambition. These offsets allow us to take responsibility for those emissions that are an unavoidable part of doing business. Energy use: Through the efforts of PwC’s Real Estate team, we’ve optimized our office space and our energy use has decreased by 40% per full-time employee between FY07 and FY19. For our remaining energy footprint from electricity use, we purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs), so that 100% of those emissions are covered by electricity generated from renewable sources like solar or wind. What can I do at work to manage my footprint? Here are some tips to help minimize your impact on climate change: Turn off unused lights, monitors or other equipment when you don’t need them. Use the firm’s virtual meeting tools to enhance calls, or skip a flight when appropriate. Take public transportation or carpool. Did you know the firm has a rideshare app? 'Ride Together'. Reduce your waste -- The best way to do this is at the beginning of the process (purchasing) versus the end (recycling or landfill), so follow these steps: REFUSE: tempting as it is, don’t take a disposable bag, extra napkins, ketchup packets etc. at lunch if you don’t really need them. REDUCE: limit what you purchase and use to what you really need. REUSE: get yourself a stylish reusable water bottle and coffee mug. RECYCLE: check what your office recycles and what goes to landfill. Join a local PwC Green Team, where you can learn more and contribute to local efforts to reduce waste and improve recycling in our offices.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Use your skills for good (anytime, anywhere) with virtual volunteering Responsible Business Leadership Dec. 17, 2019 San Jose-based Assurance Director Zack Wallerich is a practiced interviewer and has been involved in many hiring decisions over the last several years. When he stumbled across a posting in Impact Space to be a virtual interview prep coach for Candorful, a nonprofit that helps military veterans prepare for interviews while transitioning into the civilian workforce, he jumped at the opportunity to use (and improve!) his interview skills to make a difference for others. “Working with Candorful gives me an opportunity to put my interview experience to good use, and provides the flexibility I need to contribute on my schedule -- from wherever I have an internet connection. Plus it’s just an awesome cause." Military veterans gain valuable skills and knowledge from their experiences, but may have difficulty communicating them concisely in interviews with civilian employers. Some phrases that are natural in the military like "My MOS is 0231" don’t translate to civilians, but through practice veterans can learn to tailor the descriptive language they use to something like "My job in the military was an intelligence specialist." Zack has already facilitated a number of practice interview sessions with veterans and plans on continuing to stay involved as his schedule allows. “There are few ways to start the day better than to dedicate an hour before work to helping a vet nail their next interview,” states Zack. “It’s tremendously humbling and rewarding, and I encourage anyone who is short on time but interested in an impactful and sustainable way of giving back to explore virtual volunteering opportunities such as Candorful.” Zack Wallerich Assurance Director What is virtual volunteering? Virtual volunteering enables our people to use their skills and experience to make a positive societal impact through a laptop or mobile device, without needing to be physically present. How can I be a virtual volunteer? Search “virtual” to find opportunities in Impact Space. Check out the Virtual Volunteer Hub for stories and ideas for you and your team to get involved Current opportunities include: Be an eMentor this Spring (totally virtually) with a student in a Title 1 School Give advice to a student through CareerVillage.org Reminder: Charge any time spent volunteering (even if it is done virtually!) to 80071199001. For each 25 hours of time charged to our volunteer WBS codes, you’ll automatically receive a $375 Dollars for Doers credit in our giving site to use for the nonprofit of your choice (up to $1,500/year).

Recipients are among the highest-performing of all US high school students, as determined by the prestigious National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC), an independent, nonprofit organization that seeks to identify and honor exceptionally performing high school students. Meet this year's PwC Foundation National Merit Scholars We are proud of the record 21 children of PwCers who will receive the PwC Foundation's National Merit Scholarship this year. Their many accomplishments and diverse interests represent the richness of PwC — and gives us insight into the work of tomorrow. Their career ambitions span a range of fields, including architecture, marine science, film, economics, business and robotics. Let’s take a look at a few! Sarah Kwok will attend the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania and hopes to start her own architecture firm one day. “I’ve always loved making my own art as an outlet for my creative expressions and have been fascinated by the problem solving that mathematics requires. And architecture is at the intersection of these two fields,” says the daughter of IFS manager Kevin Kwok. Yadu Krishna Rasmi Sunil, son of Advisory senior manager Sunil Morakkatte, will be pursuing his passion for robotics at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Inspired by his high school robotics mentor and longtime involvement with the VEX Robotics Competition, he hopes to take his learning to the next level by majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in computer science. He hopes to channel his education and creativity into one day helping to develop improved prosthetic limbs. Magdalena and Svend Phillips, the children of IFS partner Lori Phillips, will be attending Duke University in North Carolina and Wesleyan University in Connecticut, respectively. Scuba certified and inspired by her volunteer work at the Seattle Aquarium, Magdalena plans to major in marine science. Svend plans to study filmmaking and explore his interests in writing and English — and hopes to break into the movie industry. “I’ve always enjoyed math and want to explore how I can take my knowledge in mathematics and apply it to other areas of interest, particularly economics,” says Richa Sehgal, who will major in applied mathematics and economics at Northwestern University in Illinois. Mom, Tax director Devyani Sehgal, notes “this scholarship and achievement is a testament to PwC’s focus on flexibility. With that I was able to provide support and guidance — and be present for my daughter throughout her high school career.” Please join us in congratulating all 21 PwC Charitable Foundation scholars and their families: Scholar Parent Nithya Sri Attaluri Rama Attaluri Tanner Booth Matthew Booth Samantha Chin Victor Chin Charles Forbes Robert Forbes Jessica Keane Dennis Keane Justin Kopek Tami Kopek Drew Kuroda Timothy Kuroda Sarah Kwok Kevin Kwok Tarannum Lakdawala Munawar Lakdawala Veronica Leahy Kenneth Leahy Catherine Lee Sharon Lee Chloe Martin Kenneth Martin Isabella Perrigo Christopher Perrigo Magdalena Phillips Lori Phillips Svend Phillips Lori Phillips Aditya Rajesh Rajesh Venkateswaran Christian Reddin Charles Reddin Richa Sehgal Devyani Sehgal Jill St. Clair Amy St. Clair Yadu Krishna Rasmi Sunil Sunil Morakkatte Cassidy Wallace Daniel Wallace Reminder for parents of students who took the PSAT in fall 2018 This month, NMSC will be notifying high school seniors if they qualify as a National Merit Semifinalist based on their fall 2018 Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT). Semifinalists will receive an application to advance to finalists. If your child is a semifinalist, it's important that they note that their parent/guardian works for PwC in the parental employment section on the application to be eligible for the PwC Foundation scholarship.

Suktika Mukhopadhyay serves as a board member for The Evoluer House (TEH), a nonprofit focused on giving marginalized girls of color in Philadelphia the tools they need to become college-bound and career-ready, breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty. “Growing up, I was told directly and indirectly that I was not good enough because I wasn’t a boy. I wanted to take my experiences, skills and access to resources at PwC to help make the path easier for other young girls.” Suktika has used her cybersecurity and tech skills to support TEH’s digital transformation — for example, teaching a cyber safety and social media etiquette class every summer. Over 1,000 middle and high school girls have graduated from TEH’s program, and 100% have gone on to attend college or post-secondary education/training. Camila Negret has a long-standing relationship with Esperanza Inc., which means “hope” in Spanish. For the past 36 years, the organization has focused on the intersection of youth education and diversity and inclusion, providing free mentoring, as well as comprehensive post-secondary and family support, to Hispanic and Latinx students and families in Northeast Ohio. “I love that at PwC, I can live out my personal purpose every day and connect my experiences at the firm with my personal values of serving my community and creating a culture of belonging.” Taylor Hughes and his wife started The Will King Foundation to honor the life of their newborn son who passed away in 2018 due to complications from a virus. The foundation partners with Patrons of the Hearts, a local nonprofit that brings children from developing countries to Wolfson Children’s Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. for life-saving heart treatment. To date, the foundation has sponsored five little girls and provided care packages and care teams to support all 12 international children receiving treatment through Patrons of the Hearts. “Not all children live in places with access to the specialized medical care they need for a chance at life. While they’re here in our city, we want to help these children and families receive the love, care and support we did when our twin babies were sick.” Colin Gerner and his brother GJ founded StacheStrong, shortly after GJ was diagnosed with an incurable brain cancer called Glioblastoma Multi-forme (GBM), to raise funds and awareness for brain cancer research. After a courageous 25-month battle, GJ passed away this past September, and the work of StacheStrong continues in his memory. StacheStrong has raised over $210,000 in 20 months, with $7,500 coming from the people of PwC through Impact Space. “With help from our supporters and donors, we’ve funded grants to launch two major clinical research trials. I want to do everything possible to help make sure this doesn't happen to another set of brothers.” Bethany Belmonte is passionate about The El Paso Community Foundation, an organization assisting the victims and families affected by the August shooting at Walmart in her hometown of El Paso, Texas. Through her crowdfunding efforts, she’s raised $4,000 to date, all of which will go directly to medical treatment for those affected and to education funds for the children of victims who did not survive the shooting. “El Paso is the community that supported me in becoming the first in my family to pursue higher education. That’s why it’s so important for me to find a way to give back … to help my home heal.” At PwC, giving is a powerful way to come together as One Firm to care for each other, our clients and our communities and take steps to close the opportunity gap. Whether big or small, all of our charitable contributions add up to change we can be proud of.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Fighting LGBTQ youth suicide with The Trevor Project Responsible Business Leadership Nov. 22, 2019 Young people in this country who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer &amp; questioning (LGBTQ) are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight cisgender peers. That means more than 1.8 million LGBTQ young people between the ages of 13 and 24 have seriously considered ending their lives each year. The Trevor Project is devoted to addressing this staggering problem. It’s the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ people under the age of 25. The organization offers free, confidential suicide prevention services 24/7 — by phone, online or through text. Over the past two years, the volume of The Trevor Project’s crisis services has grown quickly -- going from approximately 5,000 crisis contacts a month to more than 10,000. That’s why the PwC Charitable Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity founded by and for the people of PwC and their communities, is investing $6 million over the next four years — the largest grant received by The Trevor Project to date. With it, The Trevor Project will be able to provide its life-saving services to even more LGBTQ young people in need. The PwC Foundation grant, which was announced on Sunday at the annual TrevorLIVE Los Angeles Gala, will be used to build out The Trevor Project’s technological abilities and incorporate AI solutions into its volunteer management system. PwC is also providing pro bono consulting services and our knowledge of people, technology, and business transformation to enable Trevor to recruit and train a network of volunteers who can use smart tech solutions to reach even more of the 1.8 million LGBTQ teens who seriously consider suicide each year. With this boost to its technological infrastructure, Trevor aims to increase by 10x the number of trained volunteer crisis counselors by 2022. The opportunity to collaborate with The Trevor Project supports the PwC Foundation’s priorities of fostering inclusion, creating access for underrepresented populations and investing in innovation and scaling. Want to get involved? Here’s how you can make a difference: Give: Consider supporting the important work of The Trevor Project by making a charitable donation through Impact Space.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname High impact, zero commute: Virtual volunteering Responsible Business Leadership Sept. 13, 2019 We know you’re busy. Virtual volunteering removes travel time and maximizes your time making an impact. Alexandra Grashkina-Hristov, a Tax senior associate, used PwC’s custom CareerVillage.org site to answer students’ questions to give back while on-the-go. CareerVillage is an online platform where students (most of whom are without access to professional role models) can get advice about college and career opportunities. Professionals can answer students’ questions any time, anywhere. Since its inception in 2011, CareerVillage has helped over 3.5 million students — and Alexandra’s advice has reached over 3,000! When I first moved to the United States as a teenager, I had many questions about college and potential career opportunities. While I had great mentors and resources, I look back and wish I had known so much more. I became involved with CareerVillage because I know how hard it can be to find information about an educational or career path. I’ve had the fortune of gaining diverse experiences and knowledge during my career, and I am eager to share what I learned with others. Alexandra Grashkina-Hristov What is virtual volunteering? Virtual volunteering enables our people to use their skills and experience to make a positive societal impact through a laptop or mobile device, without needing to be physically present. It can be anything from providing pro bono support remotely to a nonprofit organization and practicing interview skills with veterans from organizations like Candorful, to reviewing student essays with InvestWrite or teaching an Access Your Potential (AYP) lesson with video conference technology. How can I be a virtual volunteer? Search “virtual” to find opportunities in Impact Space. Reach out to your local AYP Market Champion to learn about opportunities in your market. Reminder: Charge any time spent volunteering (even if it is done virtually!) to 80071199001. For each 25 hours of time charged to our volunteer WBS codes, you’ll automatically receive a $375 Dollars for Doers credit in our giving site to use for the nonprofit of your choice (up to $1,500/year). Contact: US_RBL_Info@pwc.com From digital to physical — and back again! Interns at the recent PwC Impact event gave thousands of answers to questions for students that will be posted on CareerVillage.org for thousands more students to benefit from!

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname The power of mentoring: PwCers help students supercharge their futures Responsible Business Leadership Jan. 16, 2020 January is mentoring month, and we want to celebrate PwCers who have made a difference in a student’s life by coaching, guiding and supporting them. Mentoring is often equally rewarding for the mentor, enabling them to use (and grow!) their business skills and talents for students from communities that need support the most. PwCers share what these mentoring relationships mean to them: Shannon Murphy, Senior Associate: “Recently, in our weekly gratitude journal, my little sister (from Big Brothers Big Sisters) wrote ‘I'm thankful for my life and having the best big sister Shannon ever.’ Knowing I am making a difference in a little girl's life is something that makes me very happy and proud.” Kailey Sanchez, Associate: “This past spring I had the pleasure of mentoring a high school student through buildOn. I still keep in touch with my mentee today and have helped her review college essays and build her resume — even after the program ended. I truly hope my mentee was able to get as much out of the experience as I did.” Cory Wynn, Manager: “Students from our Minds Matter group recently shared that they wanted even more sessions because the program ‘gives them something fun to do’ on Saturdays. Hearing that was so exciting to me! Beyond preparing these students academically and professionally, Minds Matter is creating a special place for our mentees. I'm proud to be part of such an incredible team and am thrilled to see where our first class of graduating students end up.” Thanks to PwCers like you, we’ve enabled over 10,000 mentoring moments in the last two and a half years. And while that’s something to celebrate, we’re not done yet! Sign up to mentor Here’s how you can share your time, talent and passion with students, either virtually or in person: Check out Impact Space for current volunteer opportunities and the Mentor Hub for resources. Virtually mentor a student this spring with eMentor (sign up by the end of January). Answer a career or college question from your laptop or phone on CareerVillage.org. This only takes minutes but makes a big impact! In fact, advice given by PwCers to students through CareerVillage.org has now been read over 1 million times since we started working with them in 2017!

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Our top 8 takeaways from the Firmwide Town Hall HQ News Nov. 1, 2019 From Workbench and collections in Digital Lab, to a new digital knowledge badge and digital upskilling channels, we covered a lot of ground on the Firmwide Town Hall broadcast on Wednesday. Didn’t get a chance to tune in live? Read up on the moments you missed here, and watch the replay (access instructions below)! We’re putting the “giving” in Thanksgiving with the Firm to Table challenge. With the holidays fast approaching, we’re taking a new approach to our firmwide Your Tomorrow challenge this year. For each weekly goal you meet — completing a digital upskilling activity in the Digital Hub, creating or joining a Be well, work well plan and leveling up in Digital Lab — the firm will donate a meal to someone in need through Feeding America. Learn more and get all the challenge details here. We’re taking Digital Lab to the next level. We’re challenging everyone to put our digital skills to the test and become an Engaged User in Digital Lab 2.0. Now, we’ll each have visibility into our individual Digital Lab engagement and a better understanding of those areas where we can further develop. Learn what makes someone an Engaged User here. To find out what the next level is for you, go to myMetrics and check out the new Digital Lab section. Then, visit Digital Lab to see what’s new and relevant to you, including Digital Lab Collections, new Workbench capabilities and Idea Marketplace. We’ll be getting a day each quarter to build our skills. One of the biggest challenges with upskilling is finding the time to take advantage of learning opportunities. That’s why the firm is making an incredible investment in Infinite Learning Days. Each quarter, we’ll all have one full day to dedicate to getting upskilled. Stay tuned for more information on the days that will be designated for your line of service or IFS functional group. New learning paths are now available. Digital Learning Paths open content that was previously available only to Digital Accelerators to anyone interested in leveling up their Digital Upskilling. Build skills and earn additional badges in four areas — Business Analytics, Intelligent Process Automation, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. Digial Learning Paths are now available in the Digital Hub. We’re all on a journey to earn a new badge. We’re rolling out a new firmwide digital badge: the Human-Centered Design knowledge badge. Human-centered design places the user at the center of innovation to help create winning digital solutions that address core needs. Our firmwide goal is to each earn our Human-Centered Design knowledge badges by June 30, 2020. Watch for more information coming soon, including how to access a kickoff webcast on Nov. 15. Get hands-on help at a Digital Café. On Nov. 12, we’re opening up our Digital Cafés, both in-person in 15 PwC offices and online. Digital Café Guides can help resolve issues with automations, data visualizations or data wrangling. If you’ve got an automation you’re trying to download and modify from Digital Lab, or a data visualization in Tableau you’ve been trying to create, but just can’t seem to figure out how to make it work ... the Digital Café is for you! We’ll be sharing more information on how to visit the Digital Café in PwC Inside soon. Visit The Well for all things Be well, work well. This new site simplifies planning and provides inspirational examples. It includes the Team Plan Builder, which helps teams design a Be well, work well plan that emphasizes communication, flexibility and engagement planning with both shared team and individual goals. As a firm, we’ve set a goal to start, or join, a team plan using the Team Plan Builder in The Well by Nov. 27 — but to meet our Firm to Table challenge goal, be sure to do so by Nov. 15. If you haven’t yet, visit The Well today to get started! PowerUp! returns. Your favorite PwC game show is back! This year, we’ll run three sprints of four to five games each, focused on specific digital topics, beginning today at 2 p.m. ET (the rest of this sprint’s games will be on Nov. 5, 12 and 19). To keep things fresh, the amount of prize money will differ each week, and you’ll have the option to donate your prize money to charity. Remember, the best way to prepare for PowerUp! and to access any of our Digital Upskilling resources is to visit the Digital Hub.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname 6 PwCers share their top travel tips US Travel Nov. 11, 2019 We reached out to a few seasoned PwC travelers for their favorite travel hacks. From planning and booking a trip to ensuring an enjoyable airport experience and flight, here’s what they had to say: Leland Thomas, manager “Keep an eye on the left-hand window of SAP Concur when you first sign in and are booking your business travel. For each selection (flight, train, hotel), special promotions offered exclusively to PwC will show up there with links of how to take advantage of them.” Travels weekly (Monday-Thursday) for work and about five to eight times per year for play Favorite airport snack: I bring protein bars in my backpack with me everywhere to keep from getting hungry. Also will occasionally pick up a few chicken nuggets. You can find other preferred travel programs exclusive to PwC here. Christina Kravatas, senior manager “I really hate packing. So I use Google Keep to make a list of items to pack ahead of time (like while I’m watching TV) and then when I go to pack, I just have to go down the list without having to think about it!” Travels about four times a year for work and up to four times per year for play Favorite airport snack: Anything salty! If you like packing lists like Christina, check out the Google Keep app or the Packing Pro app in PwC’s App Store or read about other helpful travel apps here! Whitney Browne, senior associate “My Be well, work well travel hack is to bring an empty reusable water bottle. I find that I am able to both stay hydrated and save on airport prices by bringing my own water bottle/snacks. I also use the TripIt Pro app (which can also be found in PwC’s App Store) to organize all of my travel plans. It also helps me stay one step ahead. Sometimes it knows about a delay or change even before the provider notifies me.” Travels about one to two times a month for work and about six times a year for play Favorite airport snack: Popcorn chips Daniel McKiernan, senior associate “If traveling to a different time zone, set your phone / watch to the destination time as soon as you board your flight to help reduce jet lag.” Travels about four times a year for work and about six times a year for play Favorite airport snack: Some sort of trail mix, but oddly enjoys most plane meals, too Nicole Bacharach, senior associate “Invest in a neck pillow, earplugs and an eye mask for overnight flights. You may look silly, but you‘ll have the last laugh with the amount of sleep you get! Also, bring a big scarf that doubles as a blanket. It’s great for cold flights or a makeshift pillow.” Travels about three times a year for work and 10 times a year for play Favorite airport snack: Hummus and pretzel snackers Michael Roth, manager “Always have a powerbank. Don’t count on inflight power or entertainment. And never leave for a trip without noise canceling headphones.” Travels about 10+ times a year for work and five times a year for play Favorite airport snack: Trail mix Are you a road warrior with some tricks up your sleeve?

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Verify your W-2 information by Dec. 13 US Finance Nov. 11, 2019 We are preparing your 2019 W-2 forms (wage and tax statements). Do yourself a favor by verifying (and updating, if necessary) your personal information — but act now! Any changes must be completed no later than Friday, Dec. 13 by 11:59 p.m. ET to avoid tax-time corrections, which have to be handled on your own as part of your personal tax return. Here’s how to verify your W-2 withholdings, multi-state allocations and other personal information: Visit Workday to verify your mailing and home address(es). (While you’re at it, make sure all personal information, including your emergency contact info, is current.) Keep in mind, your “home” address determines your resident state and local tax withholding status. If you have changed residency during the year and your home address is not correct, update it now so all future paychecks will be taxed appropriately. Visit the ADP Payroll Services Portal to verify federal, state and local wages are being reported on your pay statements, including multi-state allocations. Visit myMetrics for a snapshot view of your time reported working in other states. From myMetrics, select Employee 360 &gt; Time &amp; Expense &gt; Time Detail &gt; Charged Tax Areas. If you find you need to change any time allocations, you can correct those up to four periods back in Mobile Time. What else? The IRS’ new Tax Withholding Estimator is now more accurate and realigned with payroll withholding tables. It’s a helpful tool to review regularly and see if you need to update your withholding for your remaining 2019 pay, or when planning ahead for 2020 to align your withholding with your personal tax liability. Want to switch from receiving paper to electronic W-2 forms for your taxes? ADP Payroll Services lets you opt out of printed W-2 forms (Pay &amp; Taxes &gt; Go Paperless). Choose this option before Dec. 30 to receive paperless forms for 2019. Download the ADP Mobile Solutions app from PwC’s App Store to easily view pay statements and more. Next year, don’t wait! Make it a habit to check and update your personal information in Workday regularly, or any time you have a change. Questions? Call 1-877-PwC-Help (1-877-792-357), option 4 then 1.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname The latest on Hurricane Dorian and how you can help those impacted US Security Sept. 9, 2019 As we continue to learn more about the destruction caused by Dorian in the Bahamas, our hearts go out to the people and communities who have lost so much. Many of you have asked how you can help. Our US/Mexico Security team has been in touch with their counterparts and leadership of PwC Bahamas to get their guidance on how we can give our support. We are helping them to locate missing family and friends, as well as getting supplies and generators to the PwC residents in the Grand Bahamas. Additionally, a group of volunteers in the Miami office have collected requested items, and we have secured space on a ship that will deliver these goods to staff in the Freeport office later this week. Read PwC Bahamas’ latest update on Hurricane Dorian recovery efforts. To aid the broader impacted community, the PwC Charitable Foundation is contributing $250,000 to Team Rubicon USA to support its response and recovery efforts in the Bahamas. Team Rubicon is providing critical medical care and its expertise in incident management, damage assessment and route clearance to serve affected communities. More to know How can I help with immediate assistance and recovery for the broader Bahamas community? Thousands in the Bahamas have lost everything. We’ve created a Hurricane Dorian disaster relief page with information on charitable organizations providing specialized skills on the ground. Additionally, a team in the San Juan office, led by Rauluy Santos and Jose Resto, has experienced the impact of hurricanes first hand and is rallying support for their peers in the Caribbean through a crowdfunder to benefit the Bahamas Hurricane Restoration Fund. Where can I send clothing, food and supplies? Based on discussions between the US/Mexico Security team and PwC Bahamas leadership, it’s very challenging for civilians to get items to the islands at this time. Given the extent of the destruction, organizations are currently emphasizing the need for funds to purchase specific items as needed. Will the firm provide pro bono assistance to help with post-Dorian recovery? While pro bono assistance will be a longer-term effort, teams are already reviewing highest need and best fit for pro bono assistance from the firm. Decisions will be made in the coming weeks. If you are receiving requests, please reach out to Jeff Senne on the Responsible Business Leadership team. How are we helping our clients respond to Dorian? When disasters happen, our focus is on our people first — and on how we can bring the resources of the firm to help those most in need. We know our clients will also be reaching out for support. Our Global Crisis Centre is a central coordination point to support our client service teams in responding to situations like this. The Global Crisis Centre is a resource to help teams connect the dots between client requests and our capabilities, in ways that are appropriate for our audit and non-audit relationships. Should you experience any impact from these storms, please call the PwC Emergency Hotline at 1-888-755-1515. We’re here to assist you, and we can also connect you to resources to provide temporary housing, financial relief, emotional support services and other means of support.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Come Monday, hoteling is back to business-as-usual Administrative Services Jan. 9, 2020 Beginning Monday, we return to checking ourselves in to our hoteling workspaces — and taking full advantage of the new features of our updated workspace management system. Read on for reminders and tips to tech-enable the hoteling process: Be sure to check in within 60 minutes of your reservation start time — even if you’re a “resident” hoteler — or your reserved space will be released for other users. Use the Hoteling mobile app — available in PwC’s App Store — and you’ll be automatically checked in* once your mobile device is within 300 feet of the office. Set default reservation start and end times in your Hoteling app preferences to be sure your check-in window fits your schedule. Managers and above can ask Astro to quickly pull up reservation details, snooze a reservation or even find teammates. Just say: “What are my workspace reservations?” or “Snooze my hoteling reservation” or “Show hoteling for {name}.” Set preferences for buildings, floors or favorite workspaces to make reserving space even easier. * Be sure your device’s location services are set to “always on” for this feature to work. PwC never saves or uses your location data other than to support the app’s automatic check-in feature. What’s next for hoteling? Development work continues to keep improving your experience with our hoteling system. Over the next few months, you’ll see a number of small enhancements, including reservation reminders for resident hotelers (so you don’t forget to book your regular space), desktop access to the hoteling system for Mac users and improvements to the interface on certain screens.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Showing support for our colleagues facing disasters US Security Jan. 16, 2020 One of the things that makes PwC special is our value of care. When disasters strike, PwC people want to know how to help. We've heard from people asking how they can show their support for our colleagues in Puerto Rico, who have been experiencing destructive earthquakes, as well as respond to the devastating bushfires in Australia. Supporting relief efforts in Puerto Rico Puerto Rico and the surrounding region have been struck by more than 500 earthquakes registering 2.0 or higher since Dec. 28, with more than 30 of those registering greater than 4.0 magnitude. While our Security team continues to actively monitor the situation, at this time, all of our PwC colleagues in the region are accounted for and safe. If you want to help, a group in the local PwC San Juan office has set up a fundraising page on Impact Space to support relief and recovery efforts through Mentes Puertorriqueñas En Acción, Inc., a local charity focused on supporting affected communities with urgently needed supplies, as well as transition and rebuilding efforts. If you or your immediate family have experienced any impact from the Puerto Rico earthquakes (or other disasters), please call the PwC Emergency Hotline at 1-888-755-1515. We’re here to assist you, and we can also connect you to resources to provide temporary housing, financial relief, emotional support services and other means of support. Responding to bushfires in Australia We've seen the coverage of the bushfires which continue to burn in Australia. The fires have taken lives, destroyed homes and devastated large areas of Australia's natural environment. Through the Australian firm we have heard that people there are safe, but several have been impacted directly or through families. To show our support, we now have a giving page via Impact Space with several options for organizations assisting with the response as recommended by our colleagues in Australia.

While we work to resolve them here are some workarounds to help minimize disruptions in securing space in our offices. Continue to reserve space in advance as you normally would, using the hoteling app on your mobile device or laptop, or through the kiosks. Each day, you’ll be automatically checked in to the space you reserve, at the time your reservation indicates — we’ll temporarily handle this step for you while we smooth out the system issues. If you’re in an office that hasn’t yet gone Mobile Only, you may want to be sure your phone number can route to your workspace in time for your arrival; if so, please double-check that your reservation is scheduled to start close to the time you plan to arrive. The Space Concierge Team is standing by to provide any support you may need while we address these system disruptions. In the meantime, go ahead and take advantage of the updates you’ll see when you book new space, like integrated maps, same-day team space booking from our kiosks and more choices to select space based on your needs for the day.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Sunsetting Lotus Notes at PwC Chief Data Office Oct. 18, 2019 You already know we’re in the process of sunsetting Lotus Notes at PwC and launching new data retention policies. On Nov. 1, we’ll take the next step in moving away from Notes. What’s changing Nov. 1? As of Nov. 1, Lotus Notes mailboxes will have an 18-month retention period. That means we’ll start automatically deleting Lotus Notes emails when they hit the 18-month milestone. If you have an existing Notes archive, it will be removed from your PC. When this happens, you’ll see a pop-up message like the one below. If needed, you can save important Notes emails. Be sure to use the appropriate system of record for your LoS — Aura, map, DMS — to retain client engagement files and other information subject to retention policies. If you’re unsure of the correct system of record or how to use it, ask your engagement or team leader. There is special guidance for those subject to an OGC Legal Hold. Next steps toward the sunset Starting later this fiscal year, we’ll stop issuing Lotus Notes mailboxes to new joiners. Later, Notes will be removed from all our PCs. For those in Tax For Tax, the remaining mail archive will be kept for a short period of time. However, the same firmwide retention rules will be applicable for the current Notes mailbox. Are you ready for all the data retention policy changes on Nov. 1? Make sure you and your team are ready by following our readiness checklist. If your team needs help thinking about how to manage your files, request a consultation with the Chief Data Office.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Book meeting space on the fly with these hoteling improvements Administrative Services Oct. 28, 2019 Next week, you’ll notice an improved experience with our workspace management system — especially when you use the hoteling kiosks in our offices. It’s the latest tech enablement that’s moving us toward a simplified, digital in-office experience where we’ll all have better visibility into what space is available, more choices open to us and the ability to select space based on our specific work needs each day. What’s new? We’re making more space available for teams to use on-demand — which means when you need to find team space on the fly, you’ll see more options. Find and book same-day conference rooms and other team spaces directly from our hoteling kiosks. You’ll be able to see what’s open and make your reservation right away. Pinch-and-zoom integrated maps make it easy to identify the location of available space — and you can book your space directly from the map. Delegates can now book space — both meeting rooms and individual hoteling space — on behalf of others. Check out detailed instructions for delegates here.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname After Dorian, recovery is just beginning — here’s how we’re helping Responsible Business Leadership Sept. 26, 2019 Hurricane Dorian was the most powerful storm on record to hit the Bahamas, and its residents will continue to feel its destructive impact for years to come. Over the past two weeks, a group of volunteers in the PwC Miami office gathered requested items, including generators, portable gas stoves and other necessities. The group packed and prepared nearly 100 boxes of supplies to ship to Freeport to provide direct relief to our PwC Bahamas colleagues. Marriott International generously provided space for the group of volunteers to organize, sort, and pack the donations. In addition, the PwC Charitable Foundation made a $250,000 contribution to Team Rubicon USA, whose team is knee-deep in recovery efforts (view their Instagram shoutout here!). Among other relief efforts, Team Rubicon has cleared more than 70 miles of road and restored access to more than 350 homes. PwCers have also raised more than $46,000 through the Hurricane Dorian relief Impact Space page and crowdfunders started by colleagues Kevin Basden, Verne Perigord, Neil Edwards, and Armando Moss (here) and Rauluy Santos (here) to support organizations providing a variety of immediate and long-term relief services. PwCers organizing crowdfunders and pulling together assistance for hard-hit communities across the Bahamas are moved by the generosity provided by and response they’ve seen from so many colleagues who want to do their part. “I feel blessed to be part of such a great firm. On the heels of a successful year, I try to reflect on such blessing and feel a responsibility to help those in need. The Bahama crisis hits home for me, as my wife and I recently visited there on a vacation and cannot imagine what those folks are going through. The least we can do is contribute to the cause of their recovery.” Chris Janis PwC Partner If you want to learn more about and get involved in PwC’s ongoing Hurricane Dorian relief efforts, let us know via this form. We’ll reach out to you soon with details on how you can get engaged. If you or your immediate family have experienced any impact from Hurricane Dorian (or other disasters), please call the PwC Emergency Hotline at 1-888-755-1515. We’re here to assist you, and we can also connect you to resources to provide temporary housing, financial relief, emotional support services and other means of support.

Get Real ID ready by October 2020 US Travel Oct. 21, 2019 Beginning Oct. 1, 2020, only Real ID-compliant documentation will be accepted for boarding commercial flights, including domestic flights. The Real ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 to increase security measures concerning state-issued personal identification cards, mainly driver’s licenses. Compliant documentation includes passports (which are still required for international flights), passport cards and trusted traveler identification like Global Entry. But if you plan to use your driver’s license to pass through security for domestic air travel, you’ll need to make sure it’s Real ID compliant. Use the Department of Homeland Security’s Real ID FAQs to quickly check whether your driver’s license is already compliant. And, if not, visit your state’s driver’s licensing agency website for the steps and documentation required to get a compliant license. Quick read Starting Oct. 1, 2020, travelers will need Real ID-compliant driver’s licenses or other identification cards to board domestic flights.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Lab Notes: A One Firm team’s pursuit of 75% less client research time HQ News Nov. 15, 2019 This “Lab notes” series highlights success stories to inspire you to reimagine the possible through Digital Lab. With Digital Lab, our gateway to Your Tomorrow, you’re driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. First things first: Have you leveled up in Digital Lab yet? Visit Digital Lab today to find and use what’s relevant to you — and level up by next Friday, November 22 to earn a meal for someone in need through the firmwide Firm to Table challenge. And don’t miss our Workbench 101 webcast this coming Tuesday, November 19 at 2:30 p.m. ET. Click to add it to your calendar. Client Strategists who support our Private Company Services (PCS) team spend a lot of time researching prospective clients to determine whether the target is worth pursuit efforts. With just a client name, strategists thoroughly search across various databases in order to make an informed decision. Recognizing an opportunity to gather and to organize this information with a more efficient and effective process, team members from PCS Assurance, Kolkata Acceleration Center and Marketing &amp; Sales came together to develop the Research Bot for Digital Lab. The bot automatically gathers information on prospective clients from three different platforms, Fathom, GCP and Boardex, and downloads reports on the target’s financial health, leadership and business presence. The bot is expected to reduce time spent on this exercise by 75%, allowing strategists to redirect efforts to other value-added activities. Here’s what this One Firm team had to say: PCS Assurance Digital Accelerators Tommy DeGarmo, Salvador Hernandez and Lindsey Luraschi: After completing our digital training, we were interested in putting our skills to work to support our growth agenda, win in the market and build the brand of our PCS Assurance Technology DA team. We decided to branch out of our LoS, reaching out for One Firm ideas. In this case, the idea came from PCS Marketing &amp; Sales. Researching company information was clearly a manual process that could be simplified through automation, and we saw applicability outside of just the Marketing &amp; Sales team, so we were excited to pick it up. Once we started planning for the bot, a fellow Digital Accelerator, Raymond Cheung, who had built strong relationships with our Acceleration Center in India during his overseas rotation, suggested we reach out to a few coworkers who had advanced skills in robotic automation. We designed and strategized how the bot should work and our Acceleration Center was able to build it. We tested it along with the Marketing &amp; Sales team. The result was a great example of One Firm teaming. Acceleration Center Robotic Process Automation (RPA) specialists Nisha Kankaria, Siddhant Vyas and Amitanshu Mishra: We were excited to flex our robotics skills on this project. Like the US, we are on a Your Tomorrow journey looking for new opportunities to save time, automate processes and use Digital Lab. Working closely with the other teams, we were able to identify and fix bot kinks quickly. We’re looking forward to helping with more automation in the future. Marketing &amp; Sales client strategists Jessica Singh and Kelli Martin: The automation replicates the exact steps we used to take to source data on a prospective target. Now, we can just check the output of the bot and make a judgment on a potential client in a fraction of the time. Using the bot allows us to save 75% of the time, taking research exercises from about 4 hours to 1 hour. We are now able to spend that time further along in the firm's Pursuit framework, strategizing on Interact opportunities with the companies the bot helped us research. Have an idea for a solution but don’t currently know how to leverage our technology tools or don’t have the time to build an automation? You have options: Engage with a Digital Accelerator. Post your automation need to Digital Lab’s Idea Marketplace, where you can get feedback from the community and potentially see your ideas developed into solutions.

Through Digital Lab, our gateway to Your Tomorrow, we’re driving quality, reducing hours through automation and delivering the digital experience our clients expect. The best-laid plans often go awry We’ve all used an old-school project plan … but have you brought your project management tools into 2020? The Carlyle Group tax compliance engagement team is using Workbench - accessible through Digital Lab - to do just that. “When one date slipped in the process, our entire plan would be thrown off. We knew we needed to increase Carlyle management's visibility into the plan without burying them with more meetings or calls,” engagement leader Kristen Hansen recognized. Team member Ning Yim first “started emailing a spreadsheet daily with a snapshot of the status of every single deliverable — whose court the ball is in, what client-provided information is late in getting to us, etc. — to show where the holdups were and make resource decisions.” This increased transparency but the large email attachment presented other difficulties, including version control and unproductive email traffic. “For example, the client would ask their staff people at 4 p.m. what the hold up was on something when, in fact, it had been completed at noon that day but wouldn’t be captured until the next daily spreadsheet was sent the following morning.” Cloud-connected Workbench to the rescue Now, the team is using a dashboard built with PowerBI by Victor Lopes for Carlyle that is shared with the client via Workbench. This tool provides an easy-to-read visualization and is updated in real-time, helping save hours and countless emails by quickly identifying areas of opportunity or critical factors to project completion. Every week, an email is sent to the same group with some headlines and the link to the Workbench site, which anyone can click on any time of day to see the current project state. Remind me, what is Workbench? Workbench, accesible through Digital Lab, is a secure, cloud-based space where you and your engagement team can work with data and analytics using the best technologies on the market, including PwC’s proprietary solutions. Built on the firm’s Data Platform, Workbench provides self-service access to many services and advanced tools, all in one place. It also offers the abilty to share reports, so you can share visualizations with your teams and clients in just a few clicks.

We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. We’re making digital a part of the experience for our people right from their first days with the firm. Two of our interns this summer were Kadeem Langhorne and Michael Guarnuccio, who were part of the JPMorgan Chase team. During their internship, Kadeem and Michael took part in a friendly competition and put their digital skills to work to automate the Connect reporting process, which is our global audit workflow tool for real-time communication and workflow between the PwC engagement team and our clients. They demonstrated their digital acumen by going into Digital Lab, identifying a Connect-related workflow that had already been created, and editing it for the JPMorgan Chase audit and the team’s specific reporting needs. (Pro tip: Starting with Digital Lab and building on the automations that are already there is something we should all be doing.) They then created a bot that will run the workflow and create visualizations showing data such as average business days of overdue requests, percentage of requests submitted on time, and the number of requests currently overdue by line of business, among others. Kathryn Kaminsky, Global Engagement Partner for JPMorgan Chase, shared, “I loved that Kadeem and Michael were able to leverage what had already been built elsewhere in the firm through Digital Lab. And, after the right reviews, their idea will be used for reporting on the status of requests to the client, including the Global Controller.

Tired of manually inputting your time in Mobile T&amp;E each day? So were Stephanie Hayes, Imran Mehdi, Nathan Kobayashi, Stacey Chen, David Barrett, Elizabeth Robles and Tammy Martin, who together solved this problem with the Time Capture Automation (TCA). As Elizabeth explained, “My calendar is full of meetings all day, every day. I knew not having to manually re-enter my meetings in Mobile T&amp;E would be a huge time saver.” The TCA radically simplifies the time entry process by connecting Google Calendar Events to Mobile T&amp;E with a Chrome extension. Download it today for an improved timesheet entry experience, more accurate and timely time reporting, and more hours back in your day. Teams across the firm are already seeing an impact with hours saved. Here’s what they had to say: “What sort of magic is this?”- Igor Yezhov “This is a definite time saver for charging my time. It is a simple process and runs very smoothly. I look forward to this being more widely used by individuals in the firm to continue to drive efficiency as WBS codes are included in nearly all invites.” - Diedre Lauver “This will save me hundreds of hours in time reporting and create more consistent time reporting. Revolutionary!” - Julie Goosman “I could not love this automation more! When having all my meetings already associated to WBS codes, this cuts what used to be a dreaded daily task into a behind-the- scenes task that runs while I focus on other digital upskilling!” - Brian Matheny Join the robot revolution with UiPath The Time Capture Automation, like many of our other bots, was built in UiPath, our robotic process automation tool.

The “Lab notes” series highlights these success stories. We hope they inspire you to use Digital Lab to reimagine the possible on your own engagements and make a difference for our firm, our clients and each other. The ‘Smart Review’ bundle of workflows on Digital Lab is revolutionizing tax form reviews at PwC. It automates the manual process of comparing the current year to prior years’ tax returns as well as versions of current year forms. This is not only helping to eliminate human error, but allows teams to focus their review by quickly identifying areas for further investigation. We sat down with the builders — Digital Accelerators, Tax senior manager Sandra Francese and Tax senior associate Whitney Browne — to learn more. PwC Inside: How did this bundle first come about? Sandra: When we originally sat down to think about ways we could cut hours and contribute to Project 5 Million, one of the most obvious areas to tackle was the tax return form review process. In the past, teams have printed out different years of forms and manually compared each line — a process that leaves room for error, inconsistency across teams and work being accidentally repeated. Additionally, there isn’t a whole lot of evidence of review that’s easy to pass along to the next level with hard copies. Whitney: To start, we collaborated with subject matter experts to standardize the review process by creating a checklist of best practices to ensure quality and consistency across all engagements. Next, we thought about the user and what they would want in an output. We also worked with the Labs automation team to incorporate the correct technology already available at the firm. Finally, we considered scalability, so that regardless of what tax software is used and what form is prepared, users across the country can execute this automation directly from Digital Lab to meet their specific client’s needs, all without downloading any software. What has the feedback been? S: Our people are using this on a daily basis. Once you know it’s available and take the time to set it up, it’s a no-brainer — this is by far a more efficient and consistent option than manual reviews. W: On average, teams historically spent 10 hours, from the Acceleration Centers to Partner, manually reviewing each federal tax return. We estimate that teams are saving about 7 hours for each tax return they run through the Smart Review tools, and people are running these tools up to 20 times daily. So people are loving the time back, along with the comfort of knowing we are minimizing error and bringing the information directly to them. The feedback has been so great in fact, that since posting our first automation in the suite to Digital Lab in June, we’ve been making continuous enhancements and adding different form options to the suite, with the help of other Digital Accelerators. What challenges have you faced? S: Change management has been the hardest. People have been reviewing these forms a certain way for years, and there’s always some fear around change and automations. But once you get started using the suite, it doesn’t take a lot of convincing that this standardized review helps. W: We found that some of our users have to spend a bit more time when they start using the suite if they are not using Tax’s Engagement Center already (which is mandatory in Tax). So we created a Best Practices document to help address some of the common roadblocks. But again, once you get through the idea of the change and the initial set-up, it is so worth it. Any advice for PwCers just getting started on their digital journey? S: Think about what processes are not currently standardized in your day-to-day and consider the tools and platforms we already provide to help change that. The firm now has technologies, specialists (Digital Accelerators and the Digital Lab team) and assets on Digital Lab that can be adapted to fit your needs. You don’t have to start from scratch. W: Even if this bundle doesn’t apply to you in the current form and even if you aren’t the person able to change a process right now, you have options. Reach out — talk to your Digital Accelerators or submit your automation idea. If your team prepares Forms 1120, 1065 or 5471 in OneSource, GoSystem or CorpTax, the ‘Smart Review’ bundle is for you! If you have any questions, please submit them here or reach out directly to Sandra Francese and Whitney Browne. And, there are plans to expand the bundle in the near future, so stay tuned. Visit Digital Lab regularly to find relevant automations that add value to your client engagements and internal projects.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Digital Lab reward changes coming in July HQ News June 18, 2019 To encourage you to find, build and share the thousands of digital assets available on Digital Lab, and make it a part of everything you do at PwC, we’re continuing to reward points that can be redeemed by eligible users for cash rewards. When Digital Lab launched last November, we challenged you to dive in and explore the community. Now, in our second fiscal year with Digital Lab, we’re raising the bar. Beginning July 1, we’re making changes to how points are redeemed -- and will be paying out up to $1 million in rewards every quarter of FY20. What’s changing on July 1? Points redemption rate will vary by quarter, based on the total number of Digital Lab points earned that quarter across the firm. Maximum redemption rate for 1,000 points will be $150 (currently, points are converted at a rate of 1,000 points = $100). Points will be cashed out automatically at the end of each quarter. Eligible users who earned 500+ points in a quarter will receive an automatic payroll redemption shortly after the end of that quarter, based on the new rates described above. “Current Period” points will reset at the start of each quarter. Now that we’re all using Digital Lab more, you won’t earn points for basic tasks like reviewing and rating, but will continue to earn them a number of other ways. For more information on how to earn points, click here. What will happen to my current Digital Lab points? If you have 250+ points available to be redeemed within Digital Lab as of June 30, you will receive an automatic payroll redemption at a rate of 1,000 points = $100. Are you close to 250 ‘Available’ points but not quite there yet? Check out “Recommendations for You” on your Digital Lab homepage for some automations relevant to you -- and earn points for running/downloading them “Available” points will reset on July 1; any points earned from July 1 onwards will be earned and redeemable according to the FY20 process outlined above. Additional questions about this change? Check out our Rewards one-pager and additional FAQs.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname A picture’s worth a thousand words with this time saving tool HQ News Sept. 20, 2019 Do you or your team spend significant time extracting information from client documents — time that would be better spent helping deliver even more value to your clients? There’s a solution to cut hours out of your information extraction process, available now through Software Center. ABBYY FlexiCapture offers content intelligence technology, including optical character recognition, document classification and data validation. This means you can now automatically digitize, read and extract information from PDFs, emails, scanned images, and other digital documents. The Pittsburgh State and Local Tax (SALT) Indirect group is using ABBYY FlexiCapture to process up to three million invoice pages a week. We spoke with team member Dan Gwin to learn more: PwC Inside: Can you tell us about your engagement and the issue you were trying to solve? Dan: Within the SALT Indirect practice, we often do reverse audits to determine whether an item was properly taxed. For my engagement, we were given thousands of invoices and spent hundreds of hours opening each and every one to extract the information we needed, review the purchase, identify the state and local tax, and determine if the tax was accurate. What was the impact following the implementation of ABBYY FlexiCapture? Once we began using the AI-enhanced process of optical character recognition (OCR), we were able to expand the scope of our services, process up to three million pages of invoices within a week and eliminate hundreds of hours of manual tasks. With ABBYY’s OCR and information extraction capabilities, we were able to convert PDFs and scanned documents into a consolidated Excel output. Instead of handling these tasks manually, we’re researching local tax laws to expand our technical knowledge and enhance the quality of deliverables. Looking to use information extraction on your own engagement? You can access ABBYY Flexicapture by installing the software from Software Center (Software Installer). For more information and trainings, visit our PwC ABBYY site. NOTE: This technology has not been approved by the firm for use in support of audit or attest engagements. Accordingly, its deployment should be limited to non-audit and non-attest engagements at this time.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Learning to let go — a data retention checklist Chief Data Office Oct. 11, 2019 We’re changing how we think about data — and that includes emails and content stored in your Google My Drive. Rather than saving everything forever, we keep what matters. Remember, here’s a quick summary of our policy as of Nov. 1 (unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold): Emails older than 18 months will be automatically deleted from Google Mail and Lotus Notes (including Notes email archives on PCs). Google My Drive files that haven't been edited in 36 months will be automatically deleted (i.e., files with a “last modified” date older than three years). For non-Google files uploaded to My Drive, the last modified date will likely be the day you uploaded it. A readiness checklist for you and your team We’ve put together this checklist based on firm policy and best practices of teams that are ready. Think critically about what to keep. If you haven’t modified a file in three years, it’s likely you don’t need it. Visit the Data Remediation@PwC site for advice on what to keep (record data), how to keep it — and what to let go (non-record data). Use the “MySavedEmails(US)” email label to save important Google emails. Emails with this label won’t be automatically deleted after 18 months. But be judicious — not everything needs to be saved (aim for less than 5 percent). Here's how to save Notes emails. Be careful with labels — while an email can be tagged to multiple labels and sub-labels, it must be tagged with the MySavedEmails(US) to retain it outside the 18-month retention period. Refresh your understanding of when to use a system of record and the retention schedule. Your LoS has a designated system of record for retaining files. Don’t use your personal My Drive for long-term retention. Use Google integration functionality with your LoS system of record, where available. (However, for some IFS teams it is appropriate to consider Google Shared Drive for longer-term data retention.) Follow firm guidance on collaboration tools and file sharing. The collaboration tools site is a great place to learn about file sharing options for your LoS. Consider using Google Shared Drives — a great option for files shared by your team. For now, Shared Drives are not subject to automated deletion. Work with teammates to coordinate moving appropriate files. And remember, not everything needs to be moved. Ask for help when needed. If your team needs help thinking about how to manage your files, request a consultation with the Chief Data Office.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Washington Update: Elections, economic uncertainty and geopolitics Government and Public Policy Sept. 12, 2019 For internal use only. A message from Roslyn Brooks, Government, Regulatory Affairs &amp; Public Policy leader. Overview Against the backdrop of heightened trade tensions, the cooling of China’s economy, and fears of a recession in Germany and potentially elsewhere, the unpredictable policy environment is expected to continue this fall as the 2020 US elections approach. Central banks have cited geopolitical uncertainty as a critical risk to the US and global economies, including uncertainty due to unresolved trade disputes and perceived instability in the Middle East, Iran, Hong Kong, China and North Korea. Both in the US and abroad, analysts continue to highlight that many businesses will slow investing due to ongoing uncertainty with respect to China trade policy. Moreover, the negative economic consequences of tariffs to US businesses and consumers will continue to unfold. Yet the US economy is undergoing the longest economic expansion in the post World War II era, and many economic indicators, such as unemployment, labor force participation rates and wages, are at historic levels (or at least seeing major improvements over the recent past). Republican lawmakers are touting a strong economy and Democrats are forecasting storm clouds on the economic horizon. Which narrative will prevail with voters? The economy is often a reliable predictor of an incumbent political party’s likelihood of success during a presidential election. As speculation continues about a US and global economic slowdown, expect the administration’s dialogue and policies to work to counter that narrative. Although President Trump has touted strong economic indicators and stock market gains throughout much of his presidency, more recently he has criticized the actions of the Federal Reserve, floated further tax cuts and delayed a previously announced tariff in an effort to stave off an economic downturn. Whether or not an economic slowing is imminent, our clients are assessing trade dynamics and their associated macroeconomic implications in order to fine tune long-term investment decisions and meet business objectives. Trade update President Trump has made overhauling trade deals to boost manufacturing a centerpiece of his economic agenda — a strategy credited with helping him win historically Democratic states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Following a rise in US manufacturing growth, a growing recession concern in the sector still threatens to hinder President Trump’s reelection message to voters. The ongoing US-China trade dispute has imposed economic stress on these states and others. In the farm belt, retaliatory tariffs and the suspension of agricultural exports to China have significantly impacted farmers in states like Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin; states that make up part of the rural base that is crucial to the president’s reelection strategy. The political implications are difficult to predict because there is support for President Trump’s challenge to China as long overdue. However, businesses are beginning to adjust their plans to account for the possibility that trade tensions between the US and China will last through the 2020 election. Against the backdrop of uncertain negotiations with China that have rattled financial markets, the Trump administration is working toward congressional approval of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and finalizing a “skinny” trade deal with Japan, which the administration believes could bolster the president’s 2020 campaign platform and calm jittery markets. A working group of nine House Democrats worked with officials from the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) this summer on a detailed set of changes to the USMCA covering labor, environment, intellectual property rights for pharmaceuticals and enforcement. Although USTR has tried to accommodate Democrats’ concerns, specific changes would require approval from Mexico and Canada and sufficient Democratic support is not yet guaranteed. As for Japan, the preliminary agreement between President Trump and Prime Minister Abe announced at the G7 touches industrial tariffs, agriculture and digital trade, but it does not eliminate 2.5% tariffs on Japanese vehicles or auto parts or provide full market-opening access for American industrial firms who want to sell to Japan. President Trump’s threat to impose additional tariffs on auto parts at a later date remains a key issue in agreeing to a final deal. Interested parties will be watching President Trump and Prime Minister Abe’s meeting at the United Nations General Assembly to see if the deal they have announced “in principle” can be turned into something more concrete that results in legally implemented policy changes. While US-EU trade talks appear frozen, the EU is preparing for additional US pressure and tariffs on EU automobiles and agricultural products this fall. Last month, President Macron announced that the US and France had reached a deal, not confirmed by US officials, on digital tax, which would see France eliminate its 3% tax on technology companies once a new international agreement on digital taxation is reached. The OECD is aiming to have the framework finalized in 2020, although it may take longer to be approved. In the meantime, the US is likely to discourage other major trade partners’ efforts to impose a digital tax, including the UK. As uncertainty over Brexit continues, President Trump may look to accelerate trade talks with the UK as a show of support for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Congress In addition to building additional Democratic support for the USMCA, the Trump administration will need to convince House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to bring the measure to the floor this fall. This means convincing Speaker Pelosi that the deal is important to enough of her Democratic members to be worth the effort. Also on the trade front, both Republicans and Democrats have introduced legislation to rein in the president’s authority to impose tariffs, but finding consensus around a measure that the president will sign into law remains a challenge. As the November 2020 election approaches, partisan tensions between the president and Congressional Democrats continue to build with increasing calls for impeachment, mounting subpoenas of senior administration officials and documents (including the president’s tax returns) and the ongoing debate over the findings of the Mueller Report. This environment makes cutting legislative deals even harder to accomplish. Many of the legislative days remaining in this calendar year likely will be consumed by debate on spending bills required by the two-year budget and debt ceiling deal passed in July. In addition, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has made it clear the Senate will continue to prioritize confirming judicial appointments. Many businesses are focused on whether perennial issues like tax extenders will be resolved. Action on fiscal year 2020 spending bills could provide a vehicle for tax legislation before the end of 2019 to address expired or expiring tax provisions and some technical corrections to the 2017 tax reform act. Actions taken by the tax committees on tax extender legislation may serve as markers for forthcoming negotiations between House and Senate leaders. The Senate Finance Committee may mark up a tax extender bill in September. On June 20, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a bill that would retroactively extend certain expired or expiring tax provisions through December 31, 2020, and provide disaster tax relief. If passed, the package would be offset, at least partially, by accelerating the scheduled 2025 sunset of expanded estate tax relief enacted as part of the 2017 tax reform act. But President Trump and Congressional Republicans have rejected the revenue raisers proposed by House Democrats. Still, there remains some hope for an agreement on a year-end tax package, without revenue offsets, that addresses some Democratic priorities, such as expanded tax credits for lower-income families. After multiple mass shootings in El Paso, TX, Dayton, OH and West Texas, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell have openly discussed universal background checks and other potential gun safety-related measures. Leader McConnell recently reiterated he is willing to bring legislation to the Senate floor for a vote if it has the president’s support and could become law; however, there is no guarantee of Senate passage at this time. Movement on this issue likely has been facilitated by shifting public opinion in favor of stricter gun laws. In fact, a September Washington Post-ABC News poll found 86 percent of Americans support implementing red flag provisions, which allow guns to be taken from people found by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others. The same poll also showed that 89 percent of Americans support expanding federal background checks to cover private sales and gun show transactions. It is unclear if these proposals, or others, would garner the necessary support in the Senate, but at a minimum, expect Democrats to offer gun-related “poison pill” amendments to budget bills that could politicize the government spending debate. Similarly, the ongoing immigration debate and the administration’s funding requests for border security could further complicate spending negotiations. The damage left by Hurricane Dorian (or another storm yet to come) will likely lead to a disaster relief spending bill and quickly re-orient lawmakers’ attention. The Senate Banking and House Financial Services Committees are also working to address two must-pass bills this month, proposals to reauthorize both the National Flood Insurance Program and the Export-Import Bank, which are set to expire September 30, 2019. And while it may be less pressing, the committees are already working with stakeholders to explore potential reforms for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIP) well before its expiration on December 31, 2020. Data privacy legislation will continue to be a prime area of focus in the aftermath of the Capitol One data breach, though multiple committees share jurisdiction over the issue. The incident likely has increased the possibility of a federal data breach notification provision in any online privacy bill. From a purely political perspective, more than a dozen House Republicans have announced their retirements, while just three Democrats have done the same (not including those seeking higher office). Analysis by FiveThirtyEight indicates that House Republican retirements thus far generally fall into three groups, and some members fall into more than one: Those who have disagreed with President Trump, those who faced tough reelection odds and those who would likely lose seniority status. For Republicans who narrowly won in 2018 and are weighing a retirement decision, historical data is not reassuring. In fact, the last time the incumbent presidential party lost control of the House in a midterm and then gained it back in the subsequent presidential election was in 1948, when the Democrats won the House after losing it in 1946. The large number of House Republican retirements follows the typical trend of an exodus following a loss of party power after the House flips. After the 1994 “Republican Revolution,” Democrats saw 24 retirements in 1996; and when Democrats took back control in 2006, Republican retirements in 2008 spiked to two dozen. After Republicans flipped the House back, the 2012 cycle saw 20 Democratic retirements. History signals that Republican retirements will likely grow before the 2020 elections. Another factor impacting future control of the House is who prevails as the Democratic presidential nominee. After three Democratic presidential debates, the Democratic front runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has taken some attacks, but continues to hold a consistent lead in the polls. Most political analysts believe Democratic voters continue to back Biden as the candidate who would do the best in a general election against President Trump, perhaps performing well in key swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. However, if the party takes a more progressive turn in choosing its nominee, many believe it could increase the likelihood of President Trump being reelected; though, as stated earlier, a significant downturn in the economy could have a mitigating effect. SEC/PCAOB The latest Commissioner to join the SEC, Allison Lee, was confirmed by the US Senate on June 20 to replace Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein. With Lee joining, the SEC has a full complement of five commissioners for the first time under President Trump. In the fall, the Commission is expected to consider high-profile rulemakings, including those focused on proxy advisory firms and shareholder proposal thresholds. We also expect the Commission to propose to create an asset management advisory committee. Once in place, the committee would likely focus on three main areas: 1) The shift of investments from actively managed to passively managed funds; 2) The increasing reliance on third-party service providers; and 3) Systemic risk issues. The SEC will also consider a number of other rulemakings this fall, although some of these could slip into 2020. Among the many upcoming rule proposals are disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers and “proxy plumbing.” The Commission is also expected to issue final rules regarding the definition of an accelerated filer, further revisions to the Volcker Rule, modernization and simplification of disclosures regarding description of business, legal proceedings and risk factors, expanding “test-the-waters” modernization reform to all issuers (currently only available to emerging growth companies), amendments to the whistleblower program rules and amendments to financial disclosures about acquired businesses, among others. On the long-term horizon, the Commission continues to consider issues related to private securities offering exemptions, Brexit, LIBOR and cybersecurity, though no rule proposals on these issues appear imminent at this time. At the PCAOB, the Board is currently developing a concept release which would seek public comment to inform the direction of the standard-setting project and how its quality control standards could be revised in an effort to improve the quality of audit services. In September and October, the PCAOB is scheduled to host forums on auditing in the small business environment and auditing broker-dealers. Conclusion Some political analysts claim the economic anxiety felt by voters helped play a part in propelling President Trump into office in 2016. Now, amid signs of a global economic slowdown, those same anxieties could become a vulnerability in the president’s reelection bid if the contagion were to spread to the US. A negotiated trade deal with China, as well as Congress’ ratification of the USMCA, have the potential to help calm jittery markets and limit economic fears caused by current US trade policy uncertainty. But the question remains whether these agreements can be finalized in time to have the desired economic and, in turn, political impact. As the 2020 election period accelerates, expect the administration and Congress to shape the policy debate through a heightened political lens. Our clients would be wise to evaluate US trade policy through this lens as well. The anticipated additional shifts in trade policy and equally dramatic reactions from US trading partners, as well as the heightened concern for US national security and signs of a potential weakening economy, will likely impact every aspect of business, requiring constant engagement. Due to the pace of change in the trade landscape, companies will need to conduct fresh analyses of their business models and global operations to prepare for the shifts that may lie ahead.

The first thing to understand is the “last modified” date you see in Google Drive; it refers to the date the file was last edited (don’t confuse it with the “last opened by me” date). Files with a last-modified date older than 36 months will be automatically removed, unless subject to an OGC legal hold. That means you don’t need to worry about losing files you update regularly. Second, remember that the policy for My Drive files applies to a rolling 36 months. If you want to monitor files slated for deletion, consider adding some simple file management to your routine. Rest easy — we’ve got a quick tip for that. Repeat the steps below every so often to check what will be deleted. Identifying files slated for deletion: Go to your Google Drive. In the search bar type: before:2016-11-01 (or just click here). The search will return files last modified before November 1, 2016. (Note: The search will also return folders, but the retention policy will apply to the last modified date of each individual file.) After the policy is live, repeat these steps periodically, using the date 36 months prior. Two ways to prevent file deletions Simply make an edit. Updating a Google file (either the content or the file name) resets the last-modified date. For non-native My Drive files like Microsoft documents, updating the file name resets the last modified date. Or: Move team materials that are not regularly updated or modified to a Shared Drive. Engagement files must be stored in the LoS system of record. Real talk about old files If you haven’t modified a My Drive file in 36 months, it’s probably not a “must keep.” Our business changes rapidly and, generally speaking, we should not be using materials that haven’t been refreshed in more than three years. Use this opportunity to let go of files that don’t spark joy. However, don’t forget that for engagement documentation that must be retained; use the appropriate system of record for your line of service. Are you ready for all the data retention policy changes on Nov. 1? Make sure you and your team are ready by following our readiness checklist. If your team needs help thinking through how to manage your files, request a consultation with the Chief Data Office or watch a replay of our Connect &amp; Learn session. Quick read Our Google data retention policy goes into effect this Friday, Nov. 1. Here’s how to identify which My Drive files are subject to deletion in one click, and how to keep what’s needed.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Our new data retention policy and what’s next for auto-deletion Chief Data Office Oct. 31, 2019 Today, we reached another big milestone in moving away from a “keep everything forever” mindset and toward becoming active participants in managing the data lifecycle. Our new US Google data retention policy, effective today as part of our Records and Data Management Policy, applies retention periods to our active email system (Google Mail), our retiring email system (Lotus Notes) and other non-record data (including the entire G Suite)*. An important piece of making this policy business-as-usual for our firm is automating the deletion of emails and files once they age past our new retention periods. While this new policy is in effect as of today, we’re working through the final pieces to ensure we don’t interrupt our business services or processes as we begin automated deletion. You may not notice the automated deletions happening right away since they will be phased in slowly over the next several months. However, today is Day One for our policy and we should all be operating with our new retention periods in mind by following these best practices for data management. A refresher on our new policy Remember, as of Nov. 1, 2019, our policy is to automatically delete*: Some of our best tips for managing your data: That My Drive file is so 3 years ago No Notes necessary — here’s what’s changing in November Learning to let go — a data retention checklist Label of love: How to retain select Google emails What to know about our new Google data retention policy And specific guidance for our lines of service and IFS: Advisory Assurance Tax IFS *If you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold, the retention periods for only Gmail and My Drive will not apply.

We’ll check you in Administrative Services Dec. 5, 2019 From time to time, you may have had some trouble accessing our new hoteling system since it launched Nov. 4. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working diligently with the vendor to resolve these system issues. The workaround As our vendor continues to test and enhance the system to improve performance, there may be brief periods of service disruption (as some of us have experienced). Here’s what to do if you run into issues: Continue to reserve space in advance as you normally would, using the hoteling app on your mobile device or laptop, or through the kiosks. Each day, you’ll be automatically checked in to the space you reserve, at the time your reservation indicates — we’ll temporarily handle this step for you while we smooth out the system issues. If you’re in an office that hasn’t yet gone Mobile Only, to be sure your phone number routes to your workspace in time for your arrival, please double-check that your reservation is scheduled to start close to the time you plan to arrive. Need help? The Space Concierge Team is standing by to provide any support you may need while we continue to address these system disruptions.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Trade Promotion Management Integrated Solution goes Global with Upfield! Advisory Nov. 8, 2019 What was the challenge Upfield asked us to solve? Upfield wanted to: Standardize and improve the revenue management go-to-market activities globally. Redesign their sales planning and execution capabilities. Streamline price and non-price related merchandising activities with retailers and distributors. What was our solution for Upfield? Using our Trade Promotion Management (TPM) Integrated Solution, we proposed a set of differentiated capabilities to develop closed-loop trade promotion management and optimization operating model. Our solution included several aspects of the integrated solution: SAP TPM technology deployment for advanced markets, PwC Performance Analyzer tool for pre- and post-event analysis, and Excel-based templates and tools for countries that did not warrant a significant IT investment. Our key differentiators included the ability to field global teams; unsurpassed TPM expertise and experience based on 90+ implementations; deep knowledge and experience with the SAP TPM software platform combined with an excellent working relationship with SAP. The power of the TPM Integrated Solution with PwC’s Performance Analyzer tool saved Upfield from investing $3-5M to build and deploy a comparable solution! What results will Upfield see using our solution? Increased efficiency and effectiveness of their trade investments achieved by process, system and operational improvements on a global scale. Our solution will also help Upfield with financial transparency of sales and operational reductions, coupled with improved predictability of financial reporting. These outcomes help support our Fit for Growth platform, helping organizations reinvent themselves to prepare for a faster moving and unpredictable future - and now Upfield is ready! How was this win significant for us? Major first global win in a CPG sales planning and execution space, leveraging SAP TPM/BW and auxiliary technologies to deliver. First PwC Performance Analyzer win outside of US territory. A global teaming effort with US, UK and Acceleration Centers. Showcases our Alliance with SAP, as this was the first cross-SAP collaboration effort where SAP Model Company was leveraged during demos and core design activities. Will serve as a winning case study for future regional/global programs. Meet the team! We know there are many more stories to tell. Please let us know if you have an Integrated Solutions win we should feature. Want to learn more about Integrated Solutions?

Transform business with our Cloud CFO solution Advisory Dec. 6, 2019 Adopting public cloud technology is meant to be an engine of innovation that drives agility and scalability, but what’s the right way to ensure financial success? Companies typically waste an average of 35% of their cloud budgets on inefficiencies. It takes a modern approach to processes, skills, architecture design and tools to become financially efficient in managing and optimizing cloud spend. This is why PwC offers Cloud Consumption and Financial Optimization (Cloud CFO) -- a new solution that can reduce as much as 20% of our clients’ cloud spend. Cloud CFO starts by analyzing an organizations’ entire cloud presence, finding inefficiencies like redundant features and unused capacity. We combine our expertise in cloud architecture, engineering, operations, and finance to design a clear optimization plan, making sure you have exactly the services, tools, processes, controls and skills to get the job done at the lowest cost. Check out how we’re helping enterprises modernize and design an efficient and financially effective cloud platform. How can you find out more about Cloud Transformation?

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Change the attitude; change the game: BXT turned worry into excitement Advisory Nov. 5, 2019 One of America’s oldest banks and largest custodians, State Street Corporation, purchased Charles River Development in 2018. They asked us to help move from 11(!) legacy systems to a new trade compliance platform. Our approach seamlessly combined business strategy (B), experience (X), and technology (T). "PwC helped us look around the corners and see what we couldn’t see." Lou Maiuri COO, State Street Skepticism transformed to excitement during our client demo. While other firms wanted to use people to parse through mountains of data (did someone say tedious?), PwC got experimental and suggested machines, ultimately transforming the way the client worked, thought, and engaged. Machine learning identified patterns and grouped similar rules together, helping State Street convert to the new Charles River language. Viola--a drastic increase in speed and efficiency. With our staff focusing on complex rules-- while training the machines--we honed in on value and avoided repetitive tasks. We also helped our client build a control center app to manage status updates, approvals, and progress across IT, sales, and strategy teams--for thousands of the bank’s funds. Our work is helping our client get things done an entire year faster. To top it off, they’ll be able to reuse the code developed to accelerate future systems conversations and client onboardings--saving even more cash down the line.

        <pwc_body>Act Now: Google Data Retention Policy Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Act Now: Google Data Retention Policy Advisory Oct. 29, 2019 Don’t want to lose client data? Don’t say we didn’t warn you! Read the following data related policy change in detail and ACT NOW! On November 1st, Google emails (older than 18 months) and Google My Drive files (‘last modified’ over 36 months ago) will be automatically deleted.* Take Action: Work with your engagement teams and think critically about what’s important to keep, what’s not and for how long. Next, read through the guidelines for email and data retention below and make sure you address any changes prior to November 1. Important: Any documents on your individual MyDrive that have not been modified in 36 months will be automatically deleted unless moved to other firm systems (Sharepoint, Google Shared Drives**, etc.). Any engagement related documents that need to be retained in order to meet firm retention requirements should be attached to your map file. If the file exceeds the size requirements of map, or if you have questions, please reach out to Ask OFRO (US_Ask-OFRO@pwc.com) and request a briefing and consultation. Guidelines for email retention: Emails that should be retained as part of engagement working papers can be easily copied into your map file using the “Copy Cloud Mail” button located in the Documentation tab. Once it is copied, it can be deleted. Going forward we’ve also put in place a way to let you earmark select email messages to be retained in Google Mail beyond the 18-month retention period. How to save important Google emails: Open the email and select “Move to” or “Label As” in the toolbar Select MySavedEmails(US) Your email is now tagged to be retained outside of the 18-month retention period. An email can be tagged to multiple labels and sub-labels, but you must also tag it with the MySavedEmails(US) label in order to retain it outside of the 18-month retention period. PwC will monitor the use of the MySavedEmails label to ensure we, as a firm, maintain realistic targets for how much we keep outside of the retention period. Aim to save less than 5% of your emails. Excessive saving of non-record emails outside of the retention period is out of compliance with firm policies. Guidelines for My Drive data retention: Consider allowing automated deletion of My Drive files that haven’t been modified in 36 months. It is very unlikely that this data falls into the category of “must keep” — and therefore you should consider allowing these files to be automatically deleted. Follow established protocols for maintaining and retaining engagement documentation. Refer to Consulting RM policy 39. Use the current Advisory record system, map to store required engagement documentation. Work with Advisory IT and/or OFRO Risk Management resources for files that are too large to be stored in map. Business critical materials should not be housed in your My Drive or email. You should leverage other firm systems (Sharepoint, Google Shared Drives**, etc.) to store other business critical documents. If it’s not business critical, it should be allowed to be deleted in the timeframes outlined in the Google data retention policy. If you have questions, please reach out to Ask OFRO (US_Ask-OFRO@pwc.com) and request a briefing and consultation. * Unless you’re subject to an OGC Legal Hold or part of an exception group. ** Google Shared Drives (formerly known as Team Drives) are not subject to the Google data retention policies at this time.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Country Financial WIN for Insurance Transformation Integrated Solution Advisory Nov. 19, 2019 What was the challenge Country Financial was looking to solve? Country Financial’s claims processing system was aging and outdated. Adjusters were spending 60% of their time entering data rather than serving the customer. They were looking for a systems integrator to assist them with their claims transformation and implement a new system. But, with a history of failures and challenges on this project, the client needed assurance around what would be different this time. And that’s exactly what we delivered, with a bigger idea in mind based on our Fit for Growth Platform strategy. How did we leverage the Integrated Solution to win? Using pre-built accelerators from our Insurance Transformation Integrated Solution, we showed a modern claims technology and operations ecosystem (powered by Guidewire, digital, analytics, cloud, and more). This will provide Country Financial with a robust platform to build strategic capabilities in the future and improve customer experience. The Integrated Solution’s pre-built configurations, scenarios, and over 50 successful test cases differentiated the Firm from our competition and gave Country the confidence that we are the right people for the job. You could tell we struck a chord when articulating how we would use assets to build and refresh dozens of Guidewire projects to accelerate the implementation, reduce delivery risk, and increase confidence for on-time delivery. By helping them re-imagine the way they work and making this transformation a reality, we unseated the two-year incumbent, also a competitor. What results will Country Financial see using our solution? A new vendor partner model that is the first of its kind. A modern technology and operational platform that positions them better for the future to grow and expand as new innovations emerge. Elevated customer experience for policyholders that will ultimately increase retention. Automation of routine tasks that claims representatives previously had to do manually, which frees time to focus on customer relationships. How is this win significant and what results will we see? Our team came armed with the right assets of the Insurance Transformation solution as well as a smarter solution for Country Financial, using a high level of automation. This helped us win the competitive bid, increase the margin achieved by 3 pts from the original estimate and reduce overall risk for Country Financial. Additionally, we were able to save 8-10k hours of work due to the pre-built aspects of the Integrated Solution. Outstanding example of project delivery in an accelerated time frame. Meet the team!

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Helping your clients shift to a model of resilience by design Advisory Oct. 15, 2019 Good enough is not enough anymore. That much is clear from Raising the Resiliency Quotient, PwC’s Digital Trust Insights study of resilience strategies in over 3,500 firms globally. We’re in the midst of a mindset shift in what it takes to protect the business and rebound from cyber disruptions. Here’s how we know: Businesses where strategies are the most mature are also the most likely to have revamped resilience plans. And they’re not done. They’re aiming for these standards: Real-time visibility into critical assets and processes An enterprise-wide plan and response Continuous redesign of business services and processes In essence, high-RQ group members have shifted their mindset away from the traditional—and myopic—disaster recovery/business continuity model to “resilience by design.” This more expansive approach involves gaining real-time views of higher-priority processes so that decision makers and responders can react to incidents in concert, with minimal harm to the business. What you can take to your clients Clients have the opportunity to discover what sets high-RQ companies apart from the rest, and how to follow their example. Clients can also engage with the data through a series of charts. The findings can support client conversations around digital resilience. In addition, PwC’s Digital Trust Insights has suggestions on ways they can catch up to the high-RQ group.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname BXT bid adieu to dated systems at a homegrown grocery chain Advisory Nov. 19, 2019 Stater Bros., a supermarket chain, needed our help streamlining business processes and improving merchandising so they could grow and expand. But before we could begin, there was another big problem to solve: Stater Bros. operated on a system (and a culture!) that was waaay out of date. (We’re talking 30-some years). So we built an operations and technology roadmap and welcomed them to 2019. The typical solution wouldn’t work. Rather than making Stater Bros. leadership sit through an uninspired workshop while talking at them, we created an interactive experience where they physically walked through their industry gaps. We plastered the room with process flows and leading grocer practices--showing the client all the tricks proven to increase revenue and decrease labor costs. Next, we helped them understand how to streamline clunky, outdated habits by thinking holistically rather than in silos. Then, we set them up to evaluate technology vendors. The future is bright--er, green. Initial cumulative savings of $60M-$85M is expected by 2025 as long as Stater Bros. begins implementation in the next year.

Advisory Nov. 26, 2019 Advisory Start Foundations does it again! We had 168 new joiners attend our Advisory Start Foundations in October. In this particular program, Reggie Butler, an alumni of PwC and practiced leadership facilitator, was facilitating a module on successful leadership and spontaneously invited some brave souls to come up on stage. Earlier in the module the candidates who came up to the stage each picked a card with a word that resonated with them around what you need to be a successful leader. Each individual came with a different perspective and ignited the conversation around how thinking differently and understanding others strengths is the key to success in engagements. The inclusive leadership skills discussed in this session are critical to the success of our people and our firm. By encouraging diverse perspectives, we see greater innovation and better solutions for our clients. Plus, this inclusive approach to leadership fosters a sense of belonging within our firm. Eager to hear more, I jumped on a quick call with all the participants to get some insight on this session and their experience. Here’s how it went down: Thank you to Rachana Mallavarapu, Cydney Joseph, Latanya Beverly, Mary Papandreas and Maria Gleason for sharing with us their experience! And thank you to everyone who was part of this impactful program! To learn more about developing inclusive leadership skills, check out this Coaching Across Differences Vantage Playlist.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Challenging the status quo and BXT'ing clinical trials Advisory Nov. 12, 2019 Clinical trials are expensive. And they take a loooong time. Eli Lilly, a leading pharmaceutical company, wanted to change the way clinical trials are designed. The goal: improved patient focus, increased trial enrollment, faster timelines, and reduced costs. But to get there they needed our he AI, design, and automation, oh my! It typically takes about 10 years for a molecule -- that may become a life-saving medicine -- to go from the research lab to a patient's hands. And most clinical trials are conducted using the ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ model, relying on the same countries, doctors, and patient populations over and over again. We challenged that convention by blending analytics, design, AI, and automation. Introducing intuitive design and AI, we made the data optimization process easier to analyze loads of data, enabling the client’s workforce to take the right action based on data. We also implemented Agile techniques and worked side-by-side with the client to stand up a new Clinical Design Hub. We then sat down with Lilly’s clinical trial designers and informaticists to understand how they wanted to interact with new data and analytics tools to change culture, too. Lilly expects to improve their clinical design throughout the next 5 years by: Developing internal data skills, cutting down the need to purchase third-party analytics Lessening patient burden by reducing visits, tests, and procedures Identifying underserved countries or regions to reach more patients Incorporating tools that allow patients to participate virtually The big payoff: Cost savings of 20-30% through faster and more successfulclinical trial enrollment leading to a release of 2-3 molecules every 10 years, rather than just one. "PwC brought the perfect blend of business knowledge, cloud engineers, and data scientists to the team and most importantly, aligned, motivated, and worked together in the right direction."

        <pwc_body>Changing healthcare’s culture is no easy feat. We did just that. Some functionality may not be available right now. Dismiss We're working on restoring it quickly. Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Changing healthcare’s culture is no easy feat. We did just that. Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC) had an ambitious goal: transform healthcare. They wanted to move from the traditional ‘fee-for-service’ payment plan to a system based on outcomes--a model emphasizing patient health. What’s more? The client also wanted to compensate care providers based (in part) on how they keep a population healthy rather than how many tests or services they order. To establish an exemplary health care system in North Carolina, the client needed to switch from a data-driven decision culture to one where analytics steers decisions—a herculean endeavor. Using the ‘Be curious, be bold’ Difference Maker and reframing to focus on the actual problem...the need for a partner (hello!) who could help accelerate and scale insight building. With so many cross-functional teams involved, and to become one happy family, we created agile work streams. Using daily stand-ups (adios tedious status meetings), we highlighted collaborative behaviors in prioritization and decision making. Ultimately, we introduced a “fail and learn fast” culture to focus on enabling analytics to drive ROI. BCBSNC’s new PwC-built Analytics Command Center ranks programs on a five-star quality rating system, which could generate a $14M bonus provided by Medicare, encouraging care providers to put the patient first and earn those stars. Our ability to identify high-risk patients allows the client to track treatments and coordinate care that improves quality and lowers costs. We allow insurers to personalize treatments, improve customer service, and most importantly, be a positive force for good in a patient’s care plan. “A masterful analysis of prospective attribution.” Rahul Rajkumar CMO Top News About HQ Diversity &amp; inclusion Brand site Independence Compliance Firm Policies pwc.com © 2019 PwC.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Time is money, right? Find out how we saved UPS a ton of both Advisory Jan. 14, 2020 UPS wanted to improve their relationships with subcontractors to increase the efficiency of package delivery. While we helped them identify major savings, we went even bigger and framed a digital solution to simplify communication and forge collaboration. The catch? It had to work globally. It’s critical to know your audience and who you’re talking to. Using our “Be curious, be bold” Difference Maker, we pinpointed the client’s pain points: for example, the new driver who gets lost and burns time (and money) figuring out endless routes. The solution? Using BXT, we created software-based solutions like AI route optimization, saving money and enabling subcontractors to make more deliveries. Up next? Improving relationships between trucks arriving and parcels being distributed, by creating a simple app that allows for real-time interaction. We created a strategic plan to scale the idea globally. And the numbers speak for themselves: In the Netherlands, there are 31 subcontracting companies. By implementing our digital solutions, UPS could save 4M€ in the first year. In France, there are 113 subcontracting companies. Just imagine the savings. PwC offered a perfect match of different methods and tools that actually create insights that lead to valuable results.

After implementing their previous 10-year strategy, they are uncertain of the path going forward and would benefit from a structured view of possible futures of the market since the market has not undergone disruptive change recently and the impacts of significant market changes (e.g., a recession) are unclear. Our Dynamic &amp; Resilient Strategy Integrated Solution winning approach: We integrated our collaborative strategy development process with a data-driven modeling approach (dynamic strategy point-of-view and tool) to evaluate potential strategies: Offered a compelling and data-driven perspective on future health ecosystem scenarios and strategic identities. Included multiple, modeling-supported, collaborative design sessions to test and flesh out the strategy. Provided ownership of the strategy to the client. Benefits to Christ Hospital: Strategy is tailored towards Christ Hospital’s specific market assumptions in addition to providing visibility to a full spectrum of possible future scenarios. The modeling shows a clear linkage between market trends, client actions, competitor responses and financial results, highlighting key success and failure points of the strategy that can be monitored. Despite the complexity of the modeling, we are able to bring the client’s entire leadership team along the strategy development journey. Significance of the win: This win will be the first test case of the AI-driven Dynamic Strategy model at a provider client, delivering valuable learnings around integrating client data and customizing insights to the client’s market/strategy.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname 6 ways to gain an edge in the battle for talent Advisory Dec. 3, 2019 Our clients often tell us that finding great people to join their team is a constant challenge. And it’s not getting easier any time soon, given the tight labor market, shifting employee expectations and a shortage of people with in-demand skills. Released this week, our PwC Future of Recruiting survey found leaders have an opportunity to gain an edge in the battle for talent: Deliver a superior recruiting experience to every candidate, even those who don’t receive an offer. The survey revealed 6 ways top recruiters deliver: Showcase the rewards people want most (and are willing to trade salary to get) Give candidates a way to experience your culture firsthand If you want candidates’ social media details, ask for it Use tech to streamline, but keep human interaction at the center Recognize how a slow process and a failure to communicate hurt your chances of attracting talent Manage your reputation 24-7 Get more insights about the Future of Recruiting, and other major workforce trends, to share with your clients on the Platforms Navigator’s Workforce of the Future page.

Near future developments in IoT, edge computing, and 5G connectivity are likely to dramatically expand the potential use cases of these AI technologies. This is an exciting time and it is important that PwC professionals understand the underlying technology behind these advancements so that we can bring a perspective to our clients. Many of the advancements we have seen recently have come through increasingly sophisticated Machine Learning techniques which allow AI systems to analyze and extract patterns from data. In the TMT Wants to Know More webcast this month, we will discuss how Machine Learning fits into the broader realm of Artificial Intelligence and how it is shaping the future. We will examine the implications of this technology across the business value chain and highlight the risks and ethical challenges that practitioners must grapple with. This webcast will provide insight into various types of machine learning and how it differs from traditional software programming. We will also walk through current business applications for machine learning, and how PwC approaches AI and Machine Learning to help our clients become more efficient and successful.

HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Join us for TMT Wants to Know More - Conversation UI Advisory Dec. 17, 2019 In this TMT Wants to Know More learning session, we will discuss how Conversational UI is changing the way humans and computers interact. Conversational User Interfaces in the form of Voice of Chatbots are embedded in many aspects of individuals and businesses journeys. Stronger accuracy, ease of use, and promise of future capabilities is making this technology ever more relevant for forward looking businesses. Conversational UI is used in many areas of business, from HR to Marketing. Although these interfaces are empowered by the AI technology behind them, our focus in this session will be on how the human facing interfaces, both voice and text, are changing ways of doing business. This webcast will focus on the various interfaces within Conversational UI, current business use cases and monetization models, and risks associated with this technology. We will also hear from the Astro Team on how they are helping PwC lead the industry with our very own Virtual Employee Assistance Product.

Please refresh the page or try again later. HQ Search Welcome Firstname HQ Feedback Service Hub Link Index Welcome Firstname Inspiring Standard Insurance to walk a mile in the customer's shoes Advisory Dec. 17, 2019 The Standard Insurance Company needed our help refreshing their strategy. Rather than an inside-out view relying on a stale powerpoint during our pitch, we created this video highlighting customer expectations--their pain points, gripes, and insurance-related woes. Then we showed how the client could solve those problems with a shiny, new approach. We kicked off the conversation by highlighting the customer journey beyond dollars and cents. From a tumble during a dream vacation in the Himalayas leading to a 10-hour surgery, to a mom-to-be’s frustration as she prepared for the birth of her twins, we made customer issues real for The Standard. We tapped into our business, experience and tech knowledge, creating a proof of concept and wireframes, keeping the client needs front and center. Our 360-roadmap showed how they’d achieve their vision, including a core insurance and operations strategy, new technology resources, accelerators, and analytics. The client saw major value. Our first engagement led to 3 additional engagements, a 4th one launching soon, and potential for a multi-year delivery. "Your proposal and delivery really made me realize how our strategy needs to consider not only business and technology, but the experience we want to convey as the *new standard.*" Dan McMillan Vice President, Employee Benefits, Standard Insurance Company Top News About HQ Diversity &amp; inclusion Brand site Independence Compliance Firm Policies pwc.com © 2019 PwC.
